0.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome
to the Huberman Lab podcast,
2.333 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
5.97 [MUSIC PLAYING]
9.1 I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor
10.9 of neurobiology
and ophthalmology
13.0 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.83 Today we are
discussing happiness.
17.38 We're going to discuss
the science of happiness,
19.69 because indeed, there are
excellent laboratories that
22.93 have worked for many decades
to try and understand
25.21 what is this thing
that we call happiness
27.55 and what brings us happiness
in the short and long term.
31.7 In fact, we could probably
point to happiness
33.7 as one of the most sought-after
states or commodities,
37.51 or emotions.
38.36 Whatever you want to
call it, happiness
40.12 is what many people are seeking
in work, in relationships,
44.29 and in general.
45.77 And yet most of us can't
really define exactly what
48.46 happiness is or means for us.
51.49 We can point to
certain experiences,
53.35 we can try and describe our
states of mind and body,
56.39 but most people recognize
the feeling when we have it,
59.77 and we certainly recognize the
feeling of not being happy.
63.31 Whether or not that means
simply not being happy
65.77 as the absence of happiness
or all-out depression.
69.56 Now one of the key problems in
trying to understand happiness
72.79 and, indeed, the science
and psychology of happiness
75.61 is that it does indeed
involve other similar things.
79.66 Things like joy, and
gratitude, and meaning.
83.2 And indeed, many scientists
and psychologists
86.17 have argued for
many, many decades
88.6 about what happiness really is.
91.41 Now we can come up with
so-called operational
93.49 definitions of happiness.
94.66 Operational definitions are
basically agreed-upon terms
98.5 or agreed-upon
definitions and conditions
101.56 that will define something
such as happiness.
104.02 Much in the same way
that we can all probably
106.36 come up with an operational
definition of milk.
108.58 But of course, milk can be
cow's milk, it can be oat milk,
111.94 it can be soy milk,
et cetera, et cetera.
113.98 So too, something
like happiness can
115.87 be micro-divided and sliced
and diced into as many things
119.53 as we decide.
120.55 Today we are really going to
focus on three main things.
123.71 First, we are going to define
happiness as a brain state
127.15 and as a state of mind and body.
129.018 We're going to take a look at
what the science says about all
131.56 of that.
132.06 Second, we are going to talk
about tools and practices
135.01 for placing ourselves
into states of happiness.
138.46 And while for most of
us, we think of happiness
140.95 as something that only arrives
through the acquisition
144.04 of some goal or some thing
external to us, and of course,
148.13 that is true.
149.38 There is also something
called synthetic happiness
152.2 or synthesized happiness
which turns out
154.15 to be at least as powerful and
perhaps even more powerful.
157.672 Now I'll just say
right off the bat
159.13 that I'm not going to tell
you that all you have to do
161.38 is sit in a chair and
imagine being happy
163.12 in order to feel happy.
164.41 Synthesize happiness actually
involves some very concrete
167.14 steps that have been defined by
excellent labs in psychology,
170.72 so we're going to talk
about synthesize happiness
173.8 as it relates to what you can
do to obtain happy states more
177.49 readily or more frequently.
179.42 And then, third, we're
going to talk about some
181.39 of the misconceptions or what
I would call the contradictions
184.06 of happiness research.
185.62 And what I mean by
that is most of you
188.05 have probably heard about
the general conditions
191.05 for obtaining happiness.
192.22 And they always
seem to circle back
193.678 to some of the same basic
features of get great sleep,
197.56 have great social connection,
pursue meaning, don't focus
202.12 to any overextend on
things like pursuing money
205.758 because there are indeed
these studies that
207.55 show that the amount of
money that people make
209.92 does not necessarily scale
directly with happiness.
213.323 We'll talk about those studies
in some detail a little bit
215.74 later.
216.46 And while all of
that literature is
218.08 very powerful and
informative, there
221.41 is what I see as
a contradiction.
223.42 Which is for instance, that for
many of us, including myself,
227.283 especially in the
years when I was
228.7 in graduate school
and a postdoc,
230.89 there were times in which
pursuing and being involved
234.76 in work and pursuing
degrees and finding
237.16 meaning in my vocation
actually separated me
240.82 from the opportunity
to have quite
242.29 as many social connections,
or quite as much sleep,
245.14 or quite as much exercise, or
even quite as much sunshine,
248.47 for that matter.
249.5 So all of the things that we're
told that we need in order
252.01 to access happiness
on a regular basis
254.39 oftentimes contradict
with the pressures
256.99 and the requirements
of not just daily life
259.06 but in building a
life that allows
261.25 us to have the kind of
resources that we need in order
263.89 to have things like quality
social connection, and the time
268.39 and opportunity to get regular
exercise and great nutrition,
271.36 et cetera, et cetera.
272.59 So, again, while this
isn't necessarily
274.69 a complaint with any
of the research out
276.85 of the fields of
psychology on happiness,
279.91 it is important
that we acknowledge
282.46 these contradictions that
exist in the discussion
285.202 around happiness.
285.91 In particular, the
popular discussions
288.04 around the science of happiness.
289.79 So today, what we are
going to arrive at,
292.42 what you will
finish this episode,
294.04 with is a set of tools and a
framework for understanding
297.52 the pursuit of happiness
in the short and long-term
300.07 as it relates to the
research from psychology
302.35 but also the neuroscience.
304.42 And my goal today is really
to try and place that all
307.42 into a structured
framework so that you
309.67 can know where you are in
your journey or the landscape
313.78 around happiness in your
pursuit of happiness.
316.24 And what I won't
tell you is that you
318.55 need to abandon
all goals in terms
320.47 of pursuing money,
career, et cetera,
323.89 and simply focus
on relationships.
325.54 But we will talk
about what constitutes
328.42 an excellent social bond or
even in excellent conversation.
331.78 There's excellent research
that points to the fact
334.78 that even rather shallow
connections, that
337.96 is, connections between people
that you happen to just see
340.39 in the hallway on
a regular basis,
342.76 not even requiring
close bonds of any kind,
346.3 can be built into close
bonds that can deliver
349.18 a tremendous amount of feeling
and genuine social connection
352.72 provided certain
conditions are met.
355.46 So today, again, it's
really about understanding
358.66 the science of happiness,
understanding the mechanisms
361.33 underlying what
we call happiness.
362.89 And providing you a
framework by which
365.44 you can pursue and
achieve happiness not just
368.53 as a long-term goal and not
just as a day-to-day goal
371.41 of little micro exercises
of gratitude, et cetera,
374.29 but rather as a way to
think about happiness
376.93 as a state that you have
control over, at least
379.93 in terms of your
ability to access
381.7 what I would call
the algorithms that
383.68 enable us or open the
opportunity to experience
387.04 happiness.
387.61 Now before we begin
today's episode,
389.65 I'd like to talk about a very
specific tool that applies yes
393.28 to our pursuit of
happiness but actually
395.32 to our pursuit of everything,
including quality sleep
397.75 and ongoing
motivation, et cetera.
400.15 I've talked many, many
times before on this podcast
402.55 and on other podcasts,
and on social media
404.83 about the critical
value of getting
407.8 regular bright light, ideally
sunlight, in your eyes
411.13 within the first hour of waking.
412.54 Or if the sun isn't out when
you wake up in the morning,
415.63 to turn on a lot of
bright artificial lights
417.49 and then get
sunlight in your eyes
418.907 for anywhere from
5 to 20 minutes,
420.68 depending on how cloudy it is
in the early part of the day.
423.94 Absolutely outsized
effects mood and focus
426.64 during the day and
quality of sleep at night.
429.43 Now there's another
sort of central tenet
432.07 of getting great sleep
and improving mood
434.682 and focus throughout the day.
435.89 And that's to avoid
bright artificial light
438.07 exposure to your eyes between
the hours of about 10 PM
440.75 to 4:00 AM.
441.88 Now leaving shift workers aside,
and we have an entire episode
444.73 devoted to shift work, most
people are asleep at night
447.16 and awake during the day.
448.45 And you would be wise to
avoid exposure of your eyes
451.57 to bright artificial light
between the hours of 10:00
453.79 PM and 4:00 AM.
455.313 If you're going to use
screens or artificial lights,
457.48 dim them down as far as you can.
459.89 Now there are several studies
that point to the fact
462.19 that one of the major
issues with getting
464.923 bright light in your eyes
between the hours of 10:00
467.09 PM and 4:00 AM is that
it has a negative impact
470.02 on the so-called dopaminergic or
dopamine circuits of the brain
472.9 and body, which can
enhance depression.
475.6 That is lead to ongoing
lower mood and affect.
479.05 So that's a reason
to dim the lights
480.55 or avoid bright lights
between 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM.
483.07 However, I and many others
need to use artificial light
486.67 and screens sometimes, even
between the hours of 10:00
489.4 PM and midnight or even
midnight to 3:00 AM,
491.86 depending on what's going
on in my life or your life.
495.22 That may include you as well.
497.125 Now it turns out that
there are powerful ways
499.0 to offset some, not all, but
some of the negative effects
503.02 of viewing artificial lights
between the hours of 10:00
505.46 PM and 4:00 AM.
506.92 And one of the most
powerful ways to do that
509.32 is to simply adjust
the overall brightness
511.81 of your artificial
lighting throughout the day
514.0 and in the evening.
515.32 So one of the issues nowadays
that we're really facing
518.32 is that people are simply not
getting enough bright light
520.99 in their eyes from sunlight
or from other sources
523.355 during the daytime,
and they're getting
524.98 far too much bright
light in their eyes
527.88 largely from artificial sources,
of course, in the evening
530.82 and at night.
531.54 Not just from 10 PM
to 4:00 AM, but also
533.52 in the evening hours from 6 to
10 PM and so on and so forth.
536.62 So a very simple yet
powerful solution
539.13 that supported by peer-reviewed
research in humans
542.34 is to try and make your
indoor working and/or home
545.55 environment during the
day as bright as possible.
548.232 Now, if you can achieve that
through direct sunlight,
550.44 terrific.
550.99 If you can get outside a lot
during the daytime, terrific.
553.8 But many people simply cannot.
555.3 But most people do have some
windows in their environment.
558.58 I realize some don't
but, most people do.
560.37 And as a consequence,
most people
562.05 are using rather dim artificial
lighting indoors during the day
567.6 and then very bright
artificial lighting
569.7 indoors in the evening, and
at night, that's a problem.
573.262 And if you think about
it, logically, you
574.97 want to do the exact reverse.
576.92 So it's been shown
that if you simply
579.02 increase the amount of
bright artificial light
581.27 that you were exposed to
during the day, and remember
583.94 this is not an excuse to not get
your morning sunlight viewing,
587.39 but in addition to that, to make
your indoor artificial lights
590.668 very bright, bright,
bright, bright, bright
592.46 throughout the day.
593.54 And then much dimmer from the
hours of 6:00 PM until bedtime.
598.25 Or if you can't do
that, then maybe as soon
600.17 as you get home from about
8:00 PM until bedtime.
603.71 And then dim them way,
way down between 10:00
605.63 PM and 4:00 AM or off entirely.
607.79 That's going to be
a far better pattern
610.13 for your sleep-wake
cycles, focus, mood, et
612.47 cetera than what
most people do, which
614.73 is to have a few windows
in their indoor working
616.73 environment during the day and
keep the indoor lights rather
620.06 dim at a time when they
need more photons, more
622.88 light energy.
623.48 And then in the evening,
when they get home
624.77 because it's dark
outside, they tend
626.605 to turn the lights
much brighter.
627.98 You actually want
to do the reverse.
629.66 Now there's an even
simpler solution,
631.41 which is to get some bright
sunlight in your eyes
634.67 right around the time of sunset.
636.65 It doesn't have to
be exactly at sunset,
638.78 it could be in the late
afternoon and evening.
641.54 But it's been shown now
in studies on humans,
643.73 and I'll provide a
link to at least one
645.355 of those studies,
that by getting
646.79 some bright light in your
eyes, ideally from sunlight,
650.0 in the late afternoon
and evening.
651.647 And, of course, the timing will
vary depending on time of year
654.23 and where you are
located on the planet.
656.33 But facing the
sun around sunset,
659.898 you don't actually have
to see the sun cross down
661.94 below the horizon,
but facing the sun
663.53 around that time for anywhere
from 5 to 10 minutes or even
666.95 less, even two to
five minutes, can
669.74 adjust the
sensitivity of neurons
671.51 in your retina that communicate
light information to the brain
674.78 and make it such that in
the evening when you use
677.15 artificial lights, they
aren't going to have as much
680.06 of a detrimental effect
on your dopamine system
682.58 and for impairing your sleep.
685.37 So the idea is as much bright
light, ideally from sunlight
687.882 but also from artificial
sources, from the time
689.84 you wake up in the
morning until the evening.
692.36 Maybe around 6:00 or 7:00.
693.712 Maybe in the summer
months, a little bit later.
695.67 And then really try and
get as little bright light
698.66 in your eyes as you can in the
evening and nighttime hours.
702.95 And ideally, you would also get
some sunlight exposure right
707.75 around the time of sunset
or in the late afternoon.
709.97 Go outside, take
your sunglasses off.
711.86 Don't try and do this through a
windshield or through a window.
714.59 It will not work.
715.86 You have to get outside.
717.188 If you're under an
overhang, at least
718.73 try and get some direct sunlight
in your eyes at that time.
721.35 And that will adjust
the sensitivity
723.44 of your retina such that
bright artificial lights
726.2 or artificial lights
of any kind that you're
728.24 exposed to in the evening and
in the late hours of the night
731.21 won't have as much of
a detrimental effect.
733.13 That said, if you
go to the bathroom
734.63 in the middle of the night,
try and keep the lights dim.
737.053 Many people have asked
whether or not, for instance,
739.22 a nightlight or a flashlight
is going to have as much
743.0 of a negative effect.
743.93 This is very straightforward.
745.14 If you think about it, if you
shine a light at something,
747.71 you can see into
your environment.
749.45 If you've ever been
camping or you've
750.5 walked with a flashlight,
you can see things around you
752.81 that you wouldn't
otherwise, of course.
754.37 But if you were to shine
that light in your eyes,
756.15 it would be far brighter.
757.192 So yes, of course, if you get
up in the middle of the night
759.86 and you can use your phone
flashlight to illuminate
762.2 the environment that you're
in so that you can safely
763.82 go to where you need to
go and then back to bed,
765.82 that's going to be far better
than turning on the lights
768.65 or, of course, shining
light in your eyes, right.
771.17 So the idea is bright,
bright, bright in the morning
774.14 and throughout the day.
775.2 And as dim and dark
as possible at night.
778.13 And that afternoon light
viewing provides, sort of,
780.68 what I call a Netflix
inoculation that
783.56 will allow you to adjust
your retinal sensitivity
785.965 and give you a little bit
more flexibility in terms
788.09 of allowing some
nighttime light exposure
790.37 without the detrimental effects.
791.96 Now I realize today's
episode is about happiness,
794.82 it's not about
sunlight or dopamine.
797.45 And yet, as we'll
talk about more
799.94 in just a moment, if you're
not optimizing your sleep
803.28 and if you are using or
being exposed to light rather
807.41 at the wrong times of
the day/night cycle,
810.26 that is going to make it
very hard for the other sorts
813.2 of practices that
relate to happiness
815.27 to have their full impact.
816.69 So the backdrop, where I would
say the kind of landscape
819.89 of your chemicals
and your hormones,
822.08 is powerfully controlled by not
just the brightness of light
824.97 but the timing of light
and your exposure to light.
827.69 In particular, your exposure
to light to your eyes
830.39 is something that you have
a lot of control over.
832.79 You don't have absolute control,
but you have a lot of control
835.61 over.
836.28 And it's been proven that
even these small steps, which
838.94 are completely cost-free.
840.003 They require just a
few minutes of time,
841.67 but no purchase a
product or anything else
844.52 can allow you to greatly
adjust your neurochemistry
848.06 and your hormones in the
direction of better mood,
852.32 better sleep, and happiness.
854.3 Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize
856.132 that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research
858.59 roles at Stanford.
859.79 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
861.83 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
864.29 and science-related tools
for the general public.
866.96 In keeping with
that theme, I'd like
868.46 to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.
870.87 Our first sponsor is Thesis.
873.0 Thesis makes custom nootropics.
875.22 And as I've said many times
before on this podcast,
878.04 I am not a fan of
the word nootropics
880.32 because it means smart drugs.
882.24 And frankly, there are no
specific neural circuits
884.91 in the brain or body for
being quote-unquote smart.
887.91 Thesis understands
this, and they've
889.89 developed custom nootropics
that are designed
892.127 to bring your brain and
body into the state that's
894.21 ideal for what you
need to accomplish.
896.892 They use the highest
quality ingredients,
898.6 things like
phosphatidylserine, alpha GPC,
901.085 many ingredients
that I've talked
902.46 about before on this podcast
and that I happen to use myself.
905.61 I've been using Thesis
for over a year now,
907.47 and I can confidently say
that their nootropics have
909.637 been a game changer.
910.74 For me, I like their
nootropic for clarity.
913.71 I used that before
cognitive work often.
915.93 And I like their
nootropic for energy.
918.067 And I often used
that before workouts.
919.65 In particular, workouts
that are especially intense.
922.985 To get your own personalized
nootropic starter kit,
925.11 go online to
takethesis.com/huberman.
927.69 Take their 3-minute
quiz, and these
929.16 will send you four
different formulas

brought to us by InsideTracker.
941.55 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
944.25 that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA
946.8 to help me better
understand your body
948.57 and help you meet
your health goals.
950.5 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
953.22 for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact
955.83 your immediate and
long-term health
957.33 can only be analyzed with
a quality blood test.
959.712 One of the problems with a
lot of blood tests and DNA
961.92 tests out there, however,
is that you get information
964.71 back about lipids and
levels of hormones
967.38 and levels of metabolic
factors and so on,
969.323 but you don't know what to
do with that information.
971.49 InsideTracker has a very
easy-to-use online site where
974.94 you can monitor your levels.
976.65 And you can click on
any specific marker,
979.74 any specific hormone,
or metabolic factor,
982.14 and it will tell you the
behavioral tools, for instance,
985.35 exercise, the nutrition tools,
and the supplementation-based
988.993 tools that you can
use in order to bring
990.66 those numbers into
the appropriate ranges
992.7 for your immediate and
long-term health goals.

1006.17 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.
1008.87 Helix makes
mattresses and pillows
1010.61 that are of the absolute
highest quality.
1012.53 I started sleeping on a Helix
mattress well over a year ago,
1015.35 and it's been the best
sleep that I've ever had.
1017.9 One of the things that makes
Helix mattresses so unique
1020.45 is that they match the
design of the mattress
1022.4 to your unique sleep needs.
1023.71 So, for instance, if you
go on to their website,
1025.71 you can take a brief quiz.
1026.793 It's only takes about
two or three minutes.
1028.76 And you'll answer
questions like do
1029.93 you tend to run hot or
cold throughout the night.
1031.94 Or whether or not you sleep
on your back, your side,
1034.107 or your stomach, or
maybe you don't know.
1035.93 Regardless, they will match you
to the custom mattress that's
1038.96 ideal for your sleep needs.
1040.369 For me that was the
dusk D-U-S-K mattress.
1042.92 Which, for me, was not
too firm, not too soft,
1044.96 and was ideal for
my sleep patterns.
1047.27 You take the quiz,
and you'll find out
1048.89 what mattress is ideal
for your sleep patterns.
1051.18 So if you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,
1053.305 go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
take their brief sleep quiz,
1056.232 and they'll match you to
a customized mattress.
1058.19 And you'll get up to $200 off
any mattress order and two
1061.25 free pillows.
1062.15 They have a 10-year warranty.
1063.48 And you get to try
out the mattress
1064.938 for 100 nights risk-free.
1066.195 Again, if you're
interested, you can go
1067.82 to helixsleep.com/huberman for
up to $200 off and two free
1071.9 pillows.
1072.44 Let's talk about happiness.
1073.91 This thing that everybody seems
to want, and yet not everybody
1077.39 can agree on what exactly
it is or how to get it.
1082.53 Now I want to start by quoting
a previous guest on the Huberman
1086.57 Lab podcast.
1087.71 And that is a colleague of mine
at Stanford School of Medicine,
1090.5 Dr. Karl Deisseroth, who's both
a bioengineer and a clinician.
1095.72 That is, he's a psychiatrist
who spends a lot of his time
1099.11 both running a laboratory
and seeing patients,
1102.38 human patients, of course.
1103.79 And I once was at
a meeting where
1106.01 I heard Karl say something
to the extent of we
1109.88 don't know what
other people feel.
1111.873 In fact, most of the
time, we don't even
1113.54 really know how we feel.
1115.22 And while that
statement was meant
1117.32 to report several different
things about the way
1119.9 that the brain
works and emotions,
1121.4 et cetera, one of the things
that he was emphasizing,
1124.412 and I know he was emphasizing
it because he confirmed
1126.62 this for me, was the
fact that language.
1132.17 Things like the word
happiness, or joy, or meaning,
1135.95 or pleasure, or delight,
are actually not
1139.46 very precise when it comes to
describing our brain and body
1142.61 states.
1143.37 So, for instance, if I tell
you I'm feeling pretty happy.
1147.2 I know what that means for
me, at least in this moment,
1151.4 but you don't really
know whether or not
1153.29 it means the same thing as what
pretty happy means for you.
1156.86 If I say I'm extremely
happy and I have a big grin.
1160.19 I have a grin on my face that I
can't seem to wipe off my face.
1163.1 Well, then, you might get a
sense of how much happier I
1166.34 am than pretty happy.
1168.54 But it's still hard to calibrate
my level of internal state
1172.16 or happiness, and the
same is true for you
1174.23 and for everybody else.
1175.55 And it's important for
us to acknowledge this
1177.59 because at this point
in human history, 2022,
1181.85 we don't really
have a measurement
1184.67 like body temperature or
heart rate or heart rate
1187.64 variability or even a way
to measure neurochemicals
1191.33 in the brain and body
that give us anything
1194.06 better than a crude correlate
or an estimate, at best,
1198.35 of what happiness is.
1200.15 So that's really important to
understand and to keep in mind
1202.66 throughout this episode.
1203.66 It doesn't mean that we cannot
have a strong data-driven
1208.91 conversation about happiness
and what brings us to a state
1211.398 of happiness.
1211.94 But it's very important to
understand that language is not
1215.36 an ideal and maybe even
a deficient tool in terms
1218.78 of describing our emotions and
our states of mind and body.
1222.38 Now equally important
is to understand
1224.99 that while we do have
neurotransmitters,
1227.93 that is, the chemicals
that are released between
1230.66 neurons, nerve cells
that allow neurons
1232.73 to communicate, things
like glutamate and gaba,
1236.36 for instance.
1237.38 And we have what are
called modulators.
1239.78 These are chemicals
also released
1241.4 by neurons that impact the
electrical firing and chemical
1246.02 release of other neurons.
1247.1 Things like serotonin, and
dopamine, and acetylcholine,
1251.51 and epinephrine.
1252.95 Neuromodulators and
neurotransmitters
1255.8 are always present in a
cocktail in our brain and body.
1260.12 That is, they are present
in different ratios
1262.43 and at different levels.
1263.67 So we need to completely
discard with the idea
1266.0 that any one neurotransmitter
or any one neuromodulator
1270.29 is solely responsible
for a state of happiness
1273.92 or for a lack of state of
happiness, for that matter.
1277.62 That said, it is true
that for people that
1281.34 tend to have lower baseline
levels of, for instance,
1284.64 dopamine, their
levels of happiness,
1287.88 or we should say their
self-reported levels
1289.74 of happiness, tend to
be lower than for those
1292.89 that have greatly elevated
baseline levels of dopamine.
1296.34 Now, this can be
best appreciated
1298.35 at the extremes
where, for instance,
1301.44 in conditions like
Parkinson's disease
1303.69 or other conditions where
people's levels of dopamine
1306.33 in their brain is
severely depleted.
1309.46 Mind you, we also see this
in drug-addicted individuals
1312.76 that are in a withdrawal state
because they're trying to quit
1315.31 or they don't have access to the
drug that normally stimulates
1317.68 release of dopamine.
1318.513 Think the cocaine addict
who can't get cocaine.
1321.28 Or the methamphetamine
addict that
1322.72 can't or is trying to avoid
taking methamphetamine.
1326.67 Or the Parkinson's patient
who has fewer dopamine
1329.64 neurons because
they degenerated.
1331.62 Those individuals do tend
to be more depressed.
1334.44 They tend to have lower affect.
1335.88 They are less happy.
1337.5 At least, that's how they report
themselves to be emotionally.
1340.86 And that's what we observe when
we look at them behaviorally
1343.59 in terms of the amount of
smiling, the amount of energy
1346.71 they seem to have.
1348.24 At the opposite extreme.
1350.01 And while still focusing
on the kind of pathology
1353.16 of neurotransmitter and
neuromodulator systems,
1355.53 an individual who is in
a manic phase of bipolar
1359.91 will tend to have very
elevated levels of dopamine.
1363.3 And those people will
talk a mile a minute,
1365.1 and they won't require sleep.
1366.36 And at least to them, every
idea is an exciting idea and one
1369.458 that they want to pursue.
1370.5 We did an entire episode about
bipolar depression, A.K.A.
1374.79 Bipolar disorder.
1375.498 So if you'd like to learn
more about that, please
1377.54 check out that episode.
1378.69 That and all other
episodes of the podcast,
1380.68 of course, you can find it
hubermanlab.com in all formats.
1383.79 But the point here is
that very low levels
1386.52 are very high levels of
dopamine are correlated
1389.64 with certain states of,
for instance, low happiness
1393.72 or the absence of happiness.
1395.722 We could even call it
depression in some cases.
1397.68 Or extreme happiness
or even euphoria.
1400.5 Sometimes even
inappropriate euphoria,
1402.15 as is the case with
bipolar depression
1405.3 or sometimes called bipolar
mania or bipolar disorder.
1410.57 Now, of course, there's a range
in between depressed and manic.
1414.61 And most people, fortunately
reside somewhere in that range.
1418.67 And it is indeed a continuum.
1420.35 And I think it's safe to
say that levels of dopamine
1423.07 probably do correlate
with levels of happiness.
1425.26 But there is no
one single chemical
1428.32 nor chemical signature, that is,
no specific recipe of two parts
1434.92 dopamine, to one part
serotonin, to one part
1437.29 acetylcholine that we can
say equates to happiness.
1441.58 Indeed there's now
tremendous controversy
1443.41 as to whether or not,
for instance, having
1445.54 lower levels of
serotonin is actually
1448.06 the cause of depression
or merely correlates
1450.242 with depression or maybe
doesn't even correlate
1452.2 with depression, at all.
1453.2 This became especially
controversial
1454.78 because, in the last year,
the so-called serotonin
1457.45 hypothesis of depression has
been called into question.
1460.51 And indeed, it does seem to be
the case that for individuals
1464.26 that are depressed,
their levels of serotonin
1466.81 can sometimes be normal.
1468.65 However, and this is
an important however,
1471.44 that does not mean that
administering drugs
1473.62 that increase levels of
serotonin in depressed people
1476.11 does not sometimes
and indeed often help
1479.05 ameliorate some
of their symptoms.
1480.515 And I should mention that many
of the selective serotonin
1482.89 reuptake inhibitors.
1483.89 So-called SSRIs such
as Prozac and Zoloft,
1486.94 et cetera, are still
considered excellent treatments
1489.91 for conditions like OCD
and so on and so forth.
1492.95 But what I'm trying to do is
make two important points.
1495.41 First of all, that language
is not a great indicator
1500.65 of internal state.
1501.89 Especially when trying to
understand other people's
1504.465 internal state.
1505.09 And that is especially true
for things like happiness.
1508.21 And that there is
no one chemical
1510.67 signature of happiness.
1513.61 There's no one neural
modulator or combinations
1515.91 of neuromodulators
that we can say
1517.56 is the cocktail for happiness.
1519.69 But, and it's a very
important, but when
1524.14 levels of dopamine
and serotonin tend
1526.57 to be chronically
low for an individual
1529.42 below their typical
baseline, they
1531.79 will, yes, tend to
be lower in affect
1534.52 and have lower mood and less
episodes of happiness per day,
1537.8 per week, per month,
per year, et cetera.
1540.38 Conversely, when an
individual has elevations
1543.47 in dopamine and
serotonin levels,
1544.91 in particular dopamine levels
and the other so-called
1547.55 catecholamines, which include
epinephrine and norepinephrine.
1550.77 So the catecholamines are
dopamine, epinephrine,
1553.94 and norepinephrine.
1554.87 They're all very
similar biochemically.
1556.58 They all lead to states of
elevated motivation, energy,
1560.6 and so on.
1561.92 When those chemicals are
elevated above baseline,
1564.83 people do tend to have elevated
sense of mood and well-being,
1568.4 and in particular
sense of possibility
1570.86 about what they
can do in the world
1572.78 and what the world
can offer them.
1574.95 So we need to acknowledge
those two features of language
1577.79 and neurochemistry as we
wade into the discussion
1581.12 about the psychology
of happiness.
1583.58 And, in particular, about
the controlled experiments
1586.91 that have been done in
excellent laboratories focused
1589.55 on the psychology of happiness
and what brings happiness
1592.46 and what does not.
1593.51 There have been some excellent
studies on happiness.
1596.01 And these come in
two forms generally.
1598.85 One form of these
studies is individuals
1602.15 come into a laboratory.
1603.32 They participate in an
experiment over the course
1605.63 of a day or months.
1607.13 And then, data are
collected analyzed,
1609.54 and the papers are submitted,
and published, and discussed.
1613.43 The other form is so-called
longitudinal study.
1616.04 Where individuals come
into the laboratory,
1618.05 and they are studied over
a very long period of time.
1620.93 Ranging from months to years
and sometimes even decades.
1626.98 And then, the variables of
age, life circumstances,
1632.26 and other factors can be
incorporated into the data.
1635.59 And typically, there
are multiple papers,
1639.07 there's data published
throughout the longitudinal
1642.34 study, or sometimes
it's just one paper
1644.05 at the end of the
longitudinal study.
1646.51 Let's talk about one of
the more famous and perhaps
1649.33 the longest-running
longitudinal study on happiness.
1653.2 This is a study that was
initiated or conceived
1656.41 in 1938 at Harvard University.
1658.87 The so-called Harvard
Happiness Project.
1660.91 Some of you probably
heard about this.
1662.66 It involved Harvard
College sophomores
1665.86 and other individuals who were
incorporated into this study
1669.4 as well.
1670.72 It's a study that initially
had more than a couple
1674.23 of hundred subjects.
1675.82 But because some have
either dropped out and not
1678.88 been able to be contacted and
monitored over time or died,
1682.66 or for whatever reason,
are no longer participating
1685.39 in the study, they're very
few of these individuals left.
1688.22 And yet there's tremendous
power to a study like this.
1690.557 It's such an impressive study,
and we're all so grateful
1692.89 that laboratories
at Harvard decided
1694.96 to initiate and continue
this study because it
1698.56 is one of the few studies,
perhaps the study that
1701.29 has allowed us to understand
happiness in our species
1705.01 over a very long period of time.
1707.41 Like any study,
it's not perfect.
1708.91 It didn't include a
lot of matching by sex
1712.6 or matching by
vocation, or matching
1714.37 by income and background.
1715.78 And back then, there was
also a lot less discussion
1718.42 about trauma and
histories around trauma,
1720.56 as well as positive
episodes in people's lives.
1722.89 Nonetheless, there's a lot of
power in a study like this.
1726.58 And there are some
very basic takeaways,
1728.863 some of which you may have heard
before but some of which may be
1731.53 surprising those
of you who haven't.
1734.78 So one of the key
things about the study
1737.68 is people in the
study, at least those
1740.83 who still have intact memory,
which many of them do,
1743.95 are able to think
back on not just
1746.68 their previous year or week but
10 years ago, 20 years ago, 50
1750.37 years ago and compare
what makes them happy
1753.7 at one age versus another age.
1755.86 A number of things have
emerged from that conversation.
1758.48 So I just want to discuss
some of the highlight points
1760.798 then we'll get into
a little bit more
1762.34 of the nitty-gritty of the data.
1763.91 First of all, it's been
discussed many, many times
1767.05 that the total amount of
income that an individual makes
1771.67 or has, and again, this
could be income from work,
1774.55 or it could be money
that they inherited,
1777.28 does not seem to directly relate
to their level of happiness.
1782.33 Now a lot of people take
that point and think,
1785.98 oh, money doesn't matter.
1787.72 Other people hear that point
and think to themselves,
1791.5 yeah, right, easy to say
if you have a lot of money.
1794.528 We'll talk about the
interpretation of those data
1796.57 in just a few minutes.
1798.08 But I do want to
earmark that finding.
1800.83 Because I agree that while
money or total resources itself
1807.76 does not predict happiness
in any kind of direct way,
1811.69 that is not the
same thing as saying
1813.4 having very few resources will
make you happier, of course.
1816.55 I don't think anyone
would imagine that.
1818.53 But it also tends to overlook
an important point, which
1822.34 is something that I certainly
have learned to appreciate
1824.71 in my life and something
that I especially appreciated
1827.65 when I was a student
and post-doc, which
1830.482 is the following.
1831.19 People will say money
can't buy happiness.
1833.53 And we'll talk about the buy
aspect of that in a moment.
1836.87 And indeed, that's true.
1838.15 If you look at this
longitudinal study or you
1840.682 look at other
studies that are done
1842.14 on a more short-term basis.
1844.27 Once people get past a
certain level of income
1846.82 relative to their cost of
living, the amount of happiness
1851.0 does not scale with that income.
1852.62 That is, for every
additional $1,000 or $10,000
1855.8 that they earn,
they don't report
1857.33 being that much happier
on a daily basis.
1860.27 Now that said, I venture the
argument that while money truly
1866.66 cannot buy happiness, it
absolutely can buffer stress.
1870.89 And in particular,
it can buffer stress
1872.75 in the form of the
ability to purchase or pay
1876.11 for goods and services,
and in particular services.
1880.34 You're not going to tell
me that having children
1884.21 doesn't involve some
increase in the demands
1886.34 on your life, less
sleep, and more demands.
1888.35 And it certainly is
the case that if you
1890.36 can hire help to clean.
1892.74 You can hire nannies
if that's your thing.
1895.55 You can hire help to assist
with babysitting or even night
1898.28 nurses if you're having trouble
sleeping that will literally
1901.07 allow you to sleep while
they take care of your child
1903.35 in the middle of the night.
1904.77 Often give excellent care.
1906.29 One hopes excellent care.
1907.55 That that won't offset
some of the stress
1909.5 associated with lack of sleep.
1910.97 So there are a million
different examples
1913.29 one could give of this, but
I certainly experienced this
1916.34 during graduate school.
1917.34 In fact, I experience both
sides of the equation here.
1919.82 I made very little money
as a graduate student.
1922.47 I had essentially no savings
when I started graduate school,
1925.34 and I made very little money.
1926.57 The amount doesn't
matter at this point,
1928.237 but I could just barely
afford rent and my food.
1930.95 I actually opted to live in the
laboratory a lot of the time.
1934.95 And by doing that,
I had more money
1937.255 to spend on other things
that were important to me.
1939.38 Now I did not have a
family at the time,
1941.64 and so I was able to do that.
1943.22 Something that not
everyone can do.
1944.75 But I made very little
money, but at the same time,
1948.44 I was in laboratory
all the time,
1950.01 and that's where I wanted to be.
1951.63 And so my level of
stress was actually
1953.45 pretty low because
I was investing
1955.01 all my time and energy
into the very thing
1957.11 that I knew would eventually
help bring me more resources.
1961.42 When I moved from being a
graduate student to a postdoc,
1964.36 for instance.
1965.35 A postdoc is generally a
three to five-year period.
1968.72 It's sort of like
residency in medicine,
1970.57 where you're no
longer taking courses,
1971.89 but you continue to do research.
1973.24 In fact, entire new
lines of research
1975.7 and prior to getting
a professorship.
1978.1 My income went up slightly,
went up by about 30% to 40%.
1983.77 But because of where I moved
and because of the times,
1987.88 my cost of living went way,
way up and I was extremely
1990.79 stressed.
1991.79 So it wasn't my
absolute income, it
1994.87 was my absolute income
relative to my cost of living.
1998.29 The other thing that
one needs to consider
2000.33 when considering income versus
cost of living is there's
2004.41 also this notion of peer group.
2005.702 And we're going to talk
more about social bonds
2007.66 and connections later.
2008.675 But one thing that
I noticed when
2010.05 I moved from being a
graduate student to a postdoc
2012.18 was I was a graduate student in
a small town where I had access
2016.95 if I chose to participate
in most, if not all,
2020.28 of the social gatherings because
they were all very low cost.
2023.28 People tended to aggregate
at the farmer's market
2025.47 on Saturday.
2025.975 Most people wouldn't even
purchase anything, at least not
2028.35 the graduate students
wouldn't purchase anything.
2030.06 It was just a
place to aggregate.
2031.435 People sometimes play
pickup games of soccer
2033.36 or just hang out
have a cup of coffee.
2035.58 There was a volleyball
game on Fridays.
2037.56 Sometimes people would go
out to eat that evening,
2040.03 which of course, costs
money, et cetera,
2042.18 but it was relatively
low cost of living.
2043.95 And social connections and
peer group interactions
2048.12 were all generated around
the same fairly low-cost
2051.27 activities.
2052.26 When I transitioned to being
a postdoc, I made more money,
2056.55 but cost of living went up.
2058.71 But in addition to
that, my peer group
2061.38 tended to want to engage in
the same kinds of activities
2064.98 that people in that larger
city were engaged in.
2068.25 So peer group has a tremendously
powerful influence on
2071.489 whether or not we gauge
the amount of money
2074.1 that we have as bringing
us happiness or not.
2077.637 And that really speaks to
the critical importance
2079.679 of social interactions
and certain kinds
2082.139 of social interactions,
in particular.
2084.188 Now, if any of that was unclear,
what I'm basically saying is
2086.73 it's not just about being
able to pay your rent.
2089.07 It's also about
being able to access
2091.44 the kinds of social interactions
that you deem are quote-unquote
2096.239 correct for you at
that stage of life
2098.76 and in the place where
you happen to be living.
2100.86 Because if you can meet all
the demands of costs of rent
2104.88 and paying your power
bill and food, et cetera,
2107.61 but you are socially
isolated because your peer
2110.58 group, or those around you
that you want to engage with,
2113.88 are engaging in activities that
you either don't have time for,
2117.6 literally, because
you're doing other things
2119.94 or that you don't have the
financial resources for,
2123.15 then that can actually
severely impact this rating
2127.53 of what we call happiness.
2129.36 Why am I parsing
this so finally?
2131.07 Well, I'm parsing and finally
because I think that most of us
2133.74 have heard the outcome of
this study from Harvard
2136.95 or the more short-term
studies, also many of which
2141.072 are from Harvard.
2141.78 We'll talk about the
just phenomenal work
2143.55 from Dan Gilbert's laboratory
and other laboratories who have
2146.092 focused on issues like these.
2147.48 And I certainly don't
want to take anything away
2149.1 from those results.
2149.892 They're very powerful
and important results
2151.95 that really point over
and over to the fact
2153.87 that people's happiness does not
necessarily scale with income.
2157.99 In fact, it tends not
to past a certain level,
2161.61 and yet I think
we'd be remiss, I
2164.173 think actually it
would be inappropriate
2165.84 for me to say that the amount
of income that one makes
2168.87 is not important.
2169.89 Because if the amount of
money that you happen to have
2173.43 or are making does
not allow you to meet
2176.88 your basic needs of shelter,
health care, et cetera.
2181.56 And/or doesn't
allow you to access
2183.81 the kind of social interactions
that can renew and reset
2188.31 or, I would say,
directly enhance
2190.62 the kind of neurotransmitter
systems and hormones
2193.02 that lead us to feel that
we are happy in our life
2195.78 and we're having quality
social connections, well then
2198.87 that's very stressful.
2200.057 And this brings me back to
the statement I made earlier,
2202.39 which is, indeed, money
cannot buy happiness,
2205.39 but it certainly
can buffer stress.
2207.52 And one of the ways
that it buffers stress
2209.4 is by allowing options
of different kinds
2212.16 of social interactions.
2213.69 Options of different
types of recreation
2216.63 that one can engage in to access
new forms of social interaction
2220.2 and so on and so on.
2221.59 So we need to be a little bit
careful or at least nuanced
2224.435 about this statement that
money can't buy happiness
2226.56 and that the data support
the fact that wealth
2228.477 doesn't determine happiness.
2230.19 I think there is a truth
to that but there's
2232.44 another side to that, I think
is less often acknowledged
2236.13 and that certainly
I've experienced
2237.833 and that I think many of
you out there have probably
2240.0 experienced as well.
2241.24 One other major finding of
the Harvard longitudinal
2243.39 study on happiness, as well
as shorter-term studies
2246.21 on happiness, is
that much as you've
2249.27 heard, perhaps that no
one on their deathbed
2252.63 says they wish they had
worked more, well indeed,
2256.05 the total amount of time
that one spends working
2258.51 does not seem to
determine one's happiness.
2262.36 And yet I also want to earmark
that result as one that we need
2265.8 to parse a bit more carefully.
2267.84 Because work, last
time I checked
2271.08 and certainly for me,
is the way typically
2273.54 that people earn an income.
2275.02 And as we just talked
about a moment ago,
2277.38 income is often a way
that people have access
2280.89 to or provide access
for their family
2283.59 to things like
recreation that opens up
2286.92 the opportunity for more
social connection, right.
2289.56 So we have to be careful with
how we interpret these blanket
2292.89 statements that have become
very popular that money doesn't
2296.22 determine happiness and that
the amount that you work
2299.19 isn't going to
determine happiness.
2301.35 It certainly is the case
that if you earn more money
2304.65 from working more and
that money is devoted
2308.37 to things that bring
more opportunities
2310.17 for social connection
or for buffering stress
2312.63 in other areas of your
life, including health care,
2315.89 care for your children,
care for yourself,
2317.64 recreation, other things
that you enjoy, well then
2321.21 I think it's a little bit naive
to assume that work itself is
2325.68 somehow counter to happiness.
2328.21 Which, of course, it isn't.
2329.91 And it especially isn't if we
combine that feature of work
2334.71 with another important feature
of the human psyche, which
2337.5 is this notion of meaning.
2339.13 Now in the
not-too-distant future,
2340.6 we will do an episode of
this podcast on meaning
2343.47 and what constitutes meaning
in a given endeavor, work
2346.08 or otherwise.
2347.22 But much of the psychology of
the last century, and still
2351.78 today, focuses on this
feature of meaning
2354.36 as a critical one in terms
of what makes us happy
2357.69 and what doesn't make us happy,
certainly in the long term.
2361.48 And I can certainly
say for myself
2363.24 that learning and teaching, and
doing research in my laboratory
2366.3 brings me tremendous feeling
of meaning and happiness.
2371.19 Some people consider
their work simply
2373.68 a way to gain a paycheck,
and other people
2377.23 find that they would do the
very work they do regardless of
2379.89 whether or not they were paid.
2381.14 In fact, many people will do
volunteer work and other forms
2383.68 of work for zero money.
2385.67 So this idea that
money isn't important
2388.24 or that work is not as
important as we deem it to be,
2392.02 that also needs to be
considered from a number
2394.36 of different perspectives.
2395.6 And again, by no
means am I trying
2397.15 to undermine the data of
these impressive studies, both
2399.67 the longitudinal and
short-term studies,
2401.41 but I think we do have to be
cautious in our discussion
2404.77 of results like these
because the internet is
2408.34 replete with conversations
about the big factors that
2413.08 determine happiness.
2413.98 It's going to be social
connection, not income.
2416.35 It's going to be
the amount of time
2419.14 that you are able to have open
thinking and creativity, which
2423.37 I think is an essential feature
of happiness, by the way.
2425.77 Physical health.
2427.18 In particular, one's
ability to stay mobile
2431.05 and to be able to access
the kind of daily activities
2433.87 that one needs to
accomplish unassisted
2436.45 is a strong correlate of
happiness and so on and so on.
2441.11 And, of course, there are
the basic physiology factors.
2444.13 The things that feed back
onto our overall feelings
2447.01 of well-being.
2447.7 And I've talked
about these before,
2449.56 and we'll just put these
quickly into a bin.
2451.78 You can think of this
as a toolkit of things
2453.97 that you and everyone really
should be constantly trying
2456.82 to access, if not optimize, on
a regular basis because they
2460.45 raise the tide or
what I would call
2462.16 the buoyancy of
your overall system,
2464.623 meaning your brain and body.
2465.79 And that would be getting
sufficient deep sleep at least
2469.48 80% of the nights of your life.
2471.01 And ideally, the remaining
20% you're not getting deep
2473.35 sleep or as much of it
because of positive events.
2477.34 Quality nutrition.
2479.17 Quality social interactions.
2480.76 And we will define that
a little bit better.
2482.602 In fact, we will define that
in a lot of detail later
2484.81 in this episode and
actually how to get better
2486.94 at creating quality
social interactions,
2488.83 even very brief
social interactions.
2491.84 So we have sleep,
we have nutrition,
2495.19 we have social interactions.
2496.81 We have purposeful
work, whether or not
2498.73 it's paid work or non-paid work.
2500.65 And, of course, there
are things like exercise
2503.98 and maybe relationships to
pets and things of that sort.
2507.07 And there are a
few others as well.
2509.06 All of those are known to
increase your overall state
2511.66 of well-being, that
puts you in a position
2514.12 to access more meaning
and happiness, et cetera.
2516.91 But for most
people, I think it's
2518.98 fair to say that
earning a living.
2521.2 And earning a living by working
is the typical way in which
2525.49 we spend most of our time.
2527.12 So I think we need to
put a special bracket
2529.48 around those activities.
2530.56 And it's something we will
return to a little bit
2532.602 later in terms of trying to
understand how periods of life
2535.45 in which there are big
or extensive work demands
2539.2 or extensive family
demands on us
2541.45 are indeed compatible
with states of happiness
2544.03 or frequent states of happiness
and how better to access those.
2547.09 Rather than simply say
money isn't important
2550.27 or the amount of time at
work really isn't important.
2552.952 That's not what people are
going to pay attention to.
2555.16 In fact, I don't know how
I will feel on my deathbed.
2557.77 How could I?
2559.18 Human beings are pretty
good about understanding
2561.73 how they feel in the present.
2563.05 If not describing it, they
are pretty good at feeling it
2566.32 if they have any sense
of internal state.
2569.2 That is interception.
2570.28 And you could have some idea
of how you feel in a moment.
2573.43 We're pretty good about
describing our past feelings,
2577.18 at least in broad
contour, but we are not
2580.27 very good at projecting how
we will feel in the future.
2582.89 And in fact, that's
a theme that's
2584.307 going to come up
again and again today.
2586.54 Nonetheless, what we do know on
the basis of really solid data
2591.58 are that certain aspects
of our well-being
2594.7 tend to change
across our lifespan.
2597.04 Now lifespan is
something that we
2600.13 need to consider from
also a bit of nuance
2602.83 because humans are indeed
living longer and longer.
2605.87 And if we look at
the data on happiness
2607.84 across the lifespan dated maybe
30 or 40 years back or even
2612.43 20 years ago, it is
consistently described
2615.79 in that literature as a
so-called u-shaped function.
2618.64 Where people in their 20s
report being very, very happy,
2625.09 but as time goes on and they
acquire more responsibility.
2629.21 So typically, getting
married and having
2631.15 children in their mid to late
20s and 30s and into their 40s.
2635.92 Having more work
demands, et cetera,
2638.02 happiness tends to be
rated lower and lower,
2640.37 at least in those
previous studies.
2641.83 And then happiness tended
to increase as people
2645.79 approach their 50s and 60s.
2647.5 And they tended to retire,
and their work demands
2649.653 were shed from
them, and they were
2651.07 able to enjoy the small things
of life despite the fact
2653.8 that, in general, I
would say almost always
2657.28 people's health is not as
vigorous when they're 70
2660.16 as it is when they're 20.
2661.75 There are exceptions
to that, of course.
2663.7 Of course, you can adjust the
rate of cognitive and physical
2666.65 decline.
2667.15 But in general,
people in their 20s
2668.85 feel more physically
and mentally vigorous
2670.6 than they do in their
60s and 70s, in general.
2673.39 That u-shaped function
that I just described still
2676.78 holds true today,
but of course, there
2678.91 have been some major shifts
to the general life stages
2683.74 and when people undergo
those life stages.
2685.985 For instance, many people are
getting married much later.
2688.36 Many people are opting
to not have children.
2690.62 In fact, if you look at the data
on whether or not people have
2694.12 children or not and how
that relates to happiness,
2697.115 everyone will tell you that
their kids are their greatest
2699.49 source of joy, at least most
people will tell you that
2701.8 and are a tremendous
source of happiness.
2705.04 It's obvious.
2705.64 Kids are delightful, and
raising kids while hard
2708.7 is a wonderful experience.
2710.93 If you look at the
ratings of happiness
2713.62 among people that elected to not
have children versus those that
2718.6 had, most people
who have children
2721.3 report their overall
levels of happiness
2723.25 as lower than that of people
who opt not to have children.
2728.17 Now there are a lot of ways
to interpret those findings.
2731.08 And by no means am I encouraging
people to not have children.
2734.8 That's a issue that you have
to resolve for yourself,
2737.92 of course.
2739.0 But we could imagine,
for instance,
2741.71 that people who opt
not to have children
2744.16 have more income to devote
to things more focused
2746.89 on themselves or their partner
or other aspects of their life.
2750.5 We don't know if that's
the underlying reason.
2752.65 We could perhaps
conclude that people
2755.2 who opt not to have children
are getting more sleep
2757.9 on a regular basis or have
more time for exercise
2761.26 or the other sorts of
things that elevate
2763.3 states of mood and well-being.
2765.25 Again we do not know
what the underlying
2767.38 reasons are for this finding.
2768.76 But it does seem that
despite most every parent
2772.54 reporting that their kids are
their greatest source of joy
2775.03 and quote-unquote
happiness in life
2776.92 that people who opt not to have
children are at least as happy
2780.43 or report being at least
as happy or even happier
2784.0 than those that opt
to have children.
2787.0 And, of course, I
want to be very clear
2789.22 that I'm not trying to
settle any arguments about
2792.087 whether or not people
should have children or not.
2794.17 I happen to find children
and animals delightful.
2797.17 And I'm always happy when
people opt to have children
2800.83 provided they are taking
good care of their children
2803.278 or doing their very best to take
good care of their children.
2805.82 So that's my stance.
2807.34 But of course,
you're all entitled
2809.08 to your own stance on this.
2810.68 There are also the
general arguments
2812.275 that people like to have
about whether or not
2814.15 the population of the Earth will
be sustained or not sustained
2817.073 based on current birth
rates, et cetera.
2818.74 Indeed many areas of the world,
birth rates are going down.
2822.04 It is actually
something that just
2824.26 as a perhaps point
of interest has
2825.82 been studied from the somewhat
unusual but logical perspective
2831.28 of whether or not child diapers
are selling at the same rate
2835.42 as they were some years ago and
whether or not adult diapers
2838.96 for the elderly are being sold
at the same rate or greater.
2843.38 If you think about it is one
indirect measure of whether
2846.82 or not people are living longer
and/or opting to have children.
2849.84 Definitely in discussion
for another time,
2851.59 probably for another
podcast entirely.
2853.87 I'd like to take a quick
break and acknowledge
2856.09 one of our sponsors
Athletic Greens.
2858.25 Athletic Greens,
now called AG1, is
2861.04 a vitamin-mineral
probiotic drink
2863.11 that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.
2865.9 I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,
2868.69 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
2870.97 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens,
2872.803 and the reason I still take
Athletic Greens once or usually
2875.53 twice a day, is that it
gets me the probiotics
2878.56 that I need for gut health.
2880.18 Our gut is very important.
2881.32 It's populated by
gut microbiota that
2883.83 communicate with the brain, the
immune system, and basically
2886.33 all the biological
systems of our body
2888.07 to strongly impact our
immediate and long-term health.
2891.61 And those probiotics
and Athletic Greens
2893.53 are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health.
2897.313 In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number
2899.23 of adaptogens,
vitamins, and minerals
2900.85 that make sure that all of my
foundational nutritional needs
2903.49 are met.
2904.12 And it tastes great.
2906.088 If you'd like to
try Athletic Greens,
2907.63 you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
2910.84 and they'll give you five
free travel packs that make it
2913.39 really easy to mix up
Athletic Greens while
2915.377 you're on the road, in the
car, on the plane, et cetera.
2917.71 And they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3K2.
2921.31 Again that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman
2923.92 to get the five free travel
packs and the year supply
2926.49 of vitamin D3K2.
2928.2 So this u-shaped function
of people being happier
2932.31 earlier in life
and then reporting
2934.74 feeling far less happy
and then happiness
2936.63 returning to them, that is,
the rising of the u again
2939.48 in their later years, is
something that I do believe
2942.39 should be repeated
in modern times.
2945.18 And repeated in a way that
takes into account that you
2948.6 might be shifted to the right.
2950.82 That is, I am certainly
aware that people are
2954.14 tending to get married later.
2955.85 Many are opting to
not have children.
2957.57 So, for instance, the
question arises whether or not
2960.98 that u-shaped curve
should have a bump down
2963.17 at the bottom of
the u among those
2964.86 that opt not to have children.
2966.11 Because the argument was made in
the discussion of those papers
2969.77 that the reason why
happiness is lower
2972.26 when people are in
their 30s, 40s, and 50s
2974.39 is because they're devoting more
time to raising their children
2977.33 and devoting more time to work.
2980.008 I would hope people
would enjoy their work,
2981.8 but not everybody really
enjoys their work.
2983.6 And many people, even if
they do enjoy their work
2986.083 and they find
meaning in it, still
2987.5 find it stressful,
which certainly
2989.57 can run counter to happiness.
2992.99 Nowadays, you could imagine
that because a number of people
2996.41 are opting perhaps to work
less or to not have children
2999.26 or both, where they
find tremendous meaning
3001.312 from their work
that there would be
3002.77 a bump at the bottom of that
u among those that decided to
3007.42 simply not take on these
additional responsibilities.
3010.113 That would be an
interesting test,
3011.53 I think, of whether or not the
total load of responsibility
3016.03 is really what's correlating
with reported happiness or not.
3020.44 Now one very consistent
finding that has absolutely
3023.38 stood the test of time, and
it's kind of an interesting one.
3025.88 It's a little bit of a
pop psychology finding,
3027.49 but I think it points to
something interesting that we
3029.98 will return to
again and again is
3031.36 that people tend
to report feeling
3034.66 lower levels of happiness,
believe it or not,
3037.13 on their birthday.
3038.71 And the argument for why
this is the following.
3043.33 That typically, we
go through our year
3046.87 not comparing ourselves to
our peers terribly much.
3050.5 We might do that
a little bit more
3052.257 when we're in elementary
school, high school, et cetera.
3054.59 We're sort of age match,
maybe even college as well.
3056.95 But an evaluation of ourselves
to our age-match peers
3060.31 is not typically something
that we do on a daily basis.
3064.03 Whereas on our birthday,
we get a snapshot
3066.91 of where we are in the arc of
time, or at least in our life.
3070.51 And many people report feeling
rather low on their birthday
3074.35 because they use that as
a benchmark or a window
3077.98 into the things that they
have not accomplished.
3080.53 The things that,
despite being age blank,
3083.71 they still haven't accomplished.
3085.48 And so that's interesting
because what it really
3087.61 points to is two things.
3088.91 One the extent to which much
of our feelings of happiness
3092.17 are relative, in particular,
relative to our peers.
3094.91 So there's that
social aspect again.
3097.57 And the fact that
most of the time, we
3100.66 are not very good at
orienting ourselves
3103.15 in the longer arc of time.
3104.253 We're pretty good
at knowing where
3105.67 we are in the arc of a
day, or the arc of a week,
3107.712 or the arc of a month, or even
a year, but that most of us
3110.68 are not very good at
reflecting on where
3112.51 we are in our life arc.
3113.968 And, of course, most
of us don't know
3115.51 how long we will
live anyway, but we
3117.55 do have some general sense.
3118.96 I mean, very few people
live past the age of 100.
3122.29 Many people live to be 70 or 80.
3125.02 And again, life span
is extending as far
3128.95 as we know from year to year.
3131.08 But, in general, people report
that on their birthdays.
3134.44 And I should say these
are for birthdays
3136.21 aged 25 or later, at
least in the studies
3140.05 I was able to access.
3141.798 I don't think that a
lot of three-year-olds
3143.59 sit around comparing themselves
to other three-year-olds
3145.923 and how well they're
doing or 12-year-olds.
3147.82 You can imagine some people
might do that at 18, et cetera.
3150.55 But it's really by the
mid-20s that people
3152.89 start evaluating
themselves to their peers
3155.05 in terms of life progression
and so-called milestones.
3158.05 It's been argued that that's
one of the reasons why people
3160.66 report lower affect,
lower levels of happiness
3162.79 on their birthday.
3163.54 Something that's a little
bit counterintuitive.
3165.498 And, of course, there
are things that are
3167.207 anti-correlated with happiness.
3168.73 I'd be remiss if I didn't
mention a few of these.
3171.04 That's longitudinal study,
the Harvard happiness project
3174.85 has reported, for
instance, that people that
3177.82 are chronic smokers of
nicotine and chronic
3180.94 consumers of alcohol, in
particular alcoholics.
3183.85 That is, people who
suffer from alcoholism
3185.62 or what sometimes is called
alcohol use disorder that
3188.95 is strongly anti-correlated
with happiness.
3191.26 And I should also mention
that the family members,
3193.39 and in particular,
the romantic partners
3195.13 of people who are chronic
smokers and the partners
3199.72 of people who are chronic
alcohol users, often
3203.2 will report lower
levels of happiness.
3204.79 Especially if they
themselves are not
3206.83 chronic smokers or regular
consumers of alcohol.
3211.3 So we've done episodes on
nicotine in particular,
3215.02 and that touched on
smoking, of course.
3216.73 And we've done an
episode on alcohol
3219.37 and the effects of
alcohol on health.
3221.74 Again, you can find
those at hubermanlab.com.
3223.81 This study from the
Harvard happiness project
3226.99 really has strong
data supporting
3229.69 the fact that avoiding
being a nicotine smoker.
3232.81 There are positive health
effects of nicotine
3234.888 that are discussed in
the episode nicotine.
3236.68 But being a-- but smoking
nicotine, in particular,
3239.44 is counterproductive for
people's at least self-reported
3243.46 happiness and certainly
overall health.
3245.53 I think there's zero question
that smoking increases
3248.14 cancers of different kinds.
3249.73 And that alcohol consumption.
3251.65 And in particular, alcohol
consumption beyond two
3254.44 drinks per week.
3256.39 Two drinks being the
typical volume of a beer,
3258.85 a glass of wine or
cocktail, et cetera,
3260.92 is detrimental for
various aspects of health.
3263.087 And, of course, there
are other things
3264.67 that you could imagine would
relate to a lack of happiness.
3268.15 For instance, a major trauma.
3270.23 Physical or emotional trauma.
3272.5 That could include the loss
of a major relationship,
3274.69 a death of a close one.
3277.0 Being the victim of a violent
crime and things of that sort.
3280.21 And yet it's been argued, in
fact, strongly argued that when
3285.07 you look at people's levels
of happiness after a trauma,
3289.42 that if you wait
about a year or so,
3294.07 sometimes is even as
short as three months
3296.23 after a trauma, that
people self-reported levels
3299.38 of happiness are not
significantly lower than they
3302.83 were prior to the trauma.
3304.36 Now I very much want to
highlight, underline, and bold
3308.83 and asterisks that
statement as one
3311.322 that we really need
to explore carefully.
3313.03 Because there are other data
that strongly point to the fact
3317.23 that major life
traumas can severely
3320.08 disrupt one sense of
happiness and well-being.
3322.27 And I think as long as we're
going to have this discussion,
3324.728 we should point to a useful
definition of trauma.
3327.79 And the definition
that I'll paraphrase
3329.83 is one that was supplied by a
former guest on the Huberman
3333.94 Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti,
who's a psychiatrist who's
3337.33 written a book called Trauma.
3338.71 I personally think it's the
best book on trauma and tools
3342.492 for alleviating trauma.
3343.45 It's incredibly thorough, easy
to read, and well-informed.
3347.35 And here again,
I'm paraphrasing,
3349.897 but Dr. Conti describes trauma
as something that fundamentally
3352.48 changes the way that our
brain and body function
3356.44 in a way that makes
other aspects of living
3358.99 more challenging.
3360.58 Again, an event, either
emotional or physical,
3363.52 or both, that fundamentally
changes the way
3365.56 that our brain and/or
body, our nervous system,
3370.0 and other organs function
in a way that prevents us
3373.42 from enjoying daily activities.
3375.91 And that could even be
ongoing distraction.
3377.83 Traumas can create
rumination, or they
3380.11 can create obsessive thought,
or they can create dissociation.
3382.87 Any number of different things.
3384.2 Again check out that
episode with Dr. Paul Conti
3386.83 if you'd like to learn
more about trauma
3388.57 and how it manifests.
3389.47 But the idea that's
been put forth
3392.02 by a number of researchers
in the field of happiness
3394.75 that three months after
a major trauma, people
3397.45 aren't reported that they
are feeling any less happy
3400.87 than before the trauma,
that was surprising to me.
3403.27 So I went into this
literature a bit more deeply.
3406.22 One of the basis of that
general line of thinking
3409.48 is a-- what I consider a now
classic and very important
3413.29 and frankly excellent
talk that was
3415.27 given by Professor Dan Gilbert
on the science of happiness.
3418.75 You can find this on YouTube.
3421.78 I say a classic one because
it was done some years ago.
3424.84 It's received millions of views.
3426.85 And one of the points that
he makes in that talk which
3429.1 is grounded in
research carried out
3431.14 by his laboratory and other
laboratories is that--
3434.53 he poses a question.
3436.25 He says you know,
let's do a quiz.
3438.79 Would you rather be someone
who wins the lottery
3441.26 and he shows a picture
of somebody who just won,
3443.26 I think it was several
hundreds of millions of dollars
3445.51 in the lottery, or was
recently made paraplegic lost
3449.14 use of their legs?
3450.95 And then goes on to
state that one year
3454.28 after people have
won the lottery,
3456.21 this major monetary windfall
versus have become paraplegic
3459.86 is that their self-reported
levels of happiness
3462.68 are the same.
3463.77 Which I think is
incredibly surprising.
3467.03 I heard this, and I immediately
thought of an experience
3470.9 that I've had where I
teach a course at Stanford
3474.56 School of Medicine on
neural regeneration.
3477.02 And it's actually a course
that I attended some years
3479.51 ago when I was a
post-doc at Stanford,
3481.17 so well over a decade ago.
3483.0 And we had-- excuse me.
3485.63 We had an individual
come into the course.
3489.18 This was an older gentleman.
3491.03 So older meaning he
was in his early 70s.
3493.55 And he had become paraplegic
fairly late in life
3496.37 from a cycling accident.
3498.02 And he was and is
an expert in what
3503.61 it is to become a
paraplegic, of course,
3505.41 because he had that experience,
but also because he spends
3507.827 a lot of his time doing
volunteer work with people who
3510.12 have become paraplegic
and have become paraplegic
3512.67 at different ages.
3513.54 And what he described to me
was that the overall outcomes
3517.47 for people that are
rendered paraplegic
3519.99 in terms of their mental health
and their physical well-being
3523.76 and their management
of general life skills
3526.11 scales with how early
they had that injury
3530.4 and how long they had
the use of their limbs.
3532.57 So it's not straightforward.
3535.3 When I heard this result
described by Dr. Dan Gilbert,
3540.19 that winning the lottery
and becoming paraplegic
3542.44 basically don't impact
your levels of happiness
3545.23 to any different degree when
people look back a year later,
3550.22 I was pretty surprised
given my experience
3553.15 of hearing this
lecture at Stanford.
3555.17 So I thought, wow,
from what I understand.
3557.14 Indeed, there are people
who are rendered paraplegic
3559.36 and manage that
transition very easily.
3562.0 It doesn't seem to disrupt
their feelings of well-being,
3564.592 et cetera, but for
other people, it
3566.05 can be severely disrupting
to their sense of well-being
3570.61 and so on and so forth.
3572.23 I went back and
examined these data.
3575.29 And in fact, a
subsequent talk, it's
3577.69 actually a podcast that
was given by Dr. Dan
3580.39 Gilbert some years later.
3582.167 So this would be
just a few years ago.
3583.75 I think in 2019-- there
is a specific date
3586.18 in which it was recorded
but just a few years ago.
3589.43 And indeed, he corrects
himself in that podcast.
3593.05 What he says is that he
misspoke in that earlier talk.
3597.04 That the difference in
self-reported levels
3600.55 of happiness for those that
have been rendered paraplegic
3603.76 for versus those who've won the
lottery is not as great as one
3608.86 would expect.
3609.445 I think most people would expect
that being rendered paraplegic
3612.07 would make people
far less happy.
3614.2 That's the expectation,
I think, anyway.
3616.21 And that people would
win the lottery,
3617.89 at least for some
period of time,
3619.36 would be far happier
than they were
3621.19 prior to winning the lottery.
3623.77 And especially given the
tremendous amount of money.
3626.51 And again, the fact that
money can't buy happiness,
3629.6 but that money does
indeed enable the ability
3632.41 to buffer stress
provided people were
3634.99 responsible with
that money and just
3636.49 didn't blow it or spend
it all right away.
3638.32 That they could start
to afford things
3640.12 that they couldn't afford, not
just in terms of luxury items
3642.73 but also the
ability to hire help
3644.7 that would free up time that
would allow them to do anything
3647.2 from travel that they couldn't
access before to meditate
3649.997 if that was something that they
didn't have time to do before.
3652.58 And so on and so forth.
3654.02 So the result quote
unquote that winners
3658.12 of the lottery and
recent paraplegics
3659.71 have the same levels of
happiness is actually not true.
3662.35 At least according to the
author of the original study.
3665.44 Now what he did not point to is
the degree to which that is not
3668.95 true, but he did point to
the direction of the result.
3671.377 And the fact that people who are
rendered paraplegic, in fact,
3673.96 are reporting
themselves as less happy
3677.85 than they were prior
to their injury.
3679.56 And certainly that their
levels of happiness
3682.2 are lower than those that
simply won the lottery
3684.753 hundreds of millions of
dollars, which I think
3686.67 is the more intuitive result.
3688.96 And so I think it's important
to be aware of that discrepancy
3691.83 because it's something
that was lost
3693.33 in the communication
around those results
3696.27 the first time around.
3697.39 And indeed, Dan Gilbert
is an excellent scientist
3700.53 and was quite good about trying
to correct the narrative.
3704.28 I myself, as a podcaster
who puts information
3707.178 on the internet, know that
the challenges of correcting
3709.47 narratives, especially of things
that came out some time ago,
3712.945 we always attempt to
do this as best we
3714.57 can, but not everyone that
saw that first video will
3717.09 necessarily hear the discussion
that has happened subsequently.
3720.24 So my hope is that Dr. Gilbert
will interpret me communicating
3725.28 this now not as an
attempt to criticize him
3727.26 but rather as an attempt
to praise his willingness
3729.51 to try and correct the
narrative to be more accurate.
3732.1 So to be very clear about what
this study did and didn't show.
3735.09 And here, I'm going to
combine these results
3738.72 with other studies
that I was able to find
3741.03 that explored
similar phenomenon.
3742.89 So major trauma, for instance.
3745.05 Not necessarily becoming
paraplegic but traumas
3748.05 of a different sort,
emotional traumas.
3750.63 When you look at the whole
of those data, at least,
3753.06 my read is that when people win
the lottery or acquire wealth
3758.34 through inheritance, some
form of wealth acquisition
3761.22 that is sudden and that wasn't
preceded by a specific effort
3764.67 to gain that wealth, right.
3765.9 Buying a lottery ticket
is a pretty quick thing.
3768.33 Inheritance is something
that you simply
3770.64 get by virtue of who you are,
not necessarily by effort.
3774.39 Well, that led to increases
in self-reported happiness
3779.46 compared to prior to the
inheritance of the lottery win,
3782.43 but it wasn't as
substantial as you
3784.8 might imagine if
you are approaching
3787.44 the notion of
happiness simply from,
3789.9 well, more money
equals more happiness.
3792.0 And while it is true that people
who are rendered paraplegic
3796.29 or who undergo psychological
traumas or physical traumas
3800.94 of any various kind
are, and frankly,
3805.69 are remarkably
resilient in many cases.
3808.2 They can still manage to
go about life and work
3811.38 and engage in
relationships, et cetera.
3813.87 There is a visible decrease
in overall levels of happiness
3818.1 and well-being,
in particular, if
3820.47 the psychological
and physical trauma
3822.69 renders their nervous system
different in a way that
3827.58 impacts other major areas of
life and enjoyment for them.
3831.81 And that's certainly true
one year out from the trauma.
3834.85 So the point is that
we do need to reframe
3837.118 this idea that whether or
not you win the lottery
3839.16 or become paraplegic or
suffer some major trauma,
3841.463 your levels of
happiness are going
3842.88 to be the same three
months or a year later.
3845.13 I don't think that's accurate.
3846.91 And in fact, Dr. Dan
Gilbert emphasized
3849.51 that that's not accurate
even in that initial study.
3853.26 And I think it's
an important thing
3855.06 to frame because that's
such a popular notion.
3857.73 Or that that idea
combined with the idea
3859.98 that increased earnings
don't make us happy
3862.53 combined with the idea that
we are happy early in life
3866.91 but then as more demands arise
in life, we become less happy,
3870.27 and then we become happy again.
3871.77 And that idea is
we already explored
3873.75 is not necessarily true.
3874.785 Frankly, I knew a lot
of teenagers and people
3876.66 in their early 20s that
are pretty unhappy who
3879.235 then become happier later as
they acquire more resources.
3881.61 Sometimes distance,
let's be honest,
3883.74 sometimes distance from
our family of origin
3886.26 makes us more happy,
sometimes less so.
3888.51 It's highly individual.
3889.99 So I think those general themes
that we've heard over and over,
3893.4 while they have merit and
they certainly stand up
3895.5 in some of the more
powerful longitudinal
3897.87 and short-term studies, there
is nuance, and in some cases,
3901.35 there are now additional
data that are causing us
3903.42 to revise those understandings.
3905.43 Now there is an
important point, or I
3906.99 should say the important
point, that we can really
3910.74 credit Dan Gilbert and others
in the field of psychology with
3914.64 and that we owe them a
great debt of gratitude
3916.95 for is that we do
have far more control
3921.39 over our levels of happiness
than we might think.
3924.18 And many of the
things that reside
3927.42 at that level of control.
3929.07 That is, the things that we can
do and think and say and access
3933.87 don't come from external things.
3936.87 They don't come necessarily
from the acquisition of material
3940.38 goods, but rather
there are things
3942.9 that we can do that can allow
us to so-called synthesize
3947.4 happiness.
3948.04 And I think this is
one of the great gifts
3950.01 of modern psychology is that--
3952.95 Dan Gilbert and others, the
Harvard happiness project,
3955.62 work at Yale and elsewhere.
3957.69 There are excellent labs working
on happiness all over the US
3961.38 and all over the world, frankly.
3963.58 One of the great gifts
that they've supplied us
3965.55 in the form of data
is that there really
3967.92 are things that we can all
do and think and access
3971.07 to allow ourselves to
so-called synthesize happiness.
3974.4 Now, this notion of
synthesizing happiness,
3977.19 or synthetic happiness
as it's sometimes called,
3980.07 can sometimes ruffle
people's feathers a bit.
3982.2 Because people immediately
flip to the idea
3985.62 that, oh, you're
just going to tell
3987.27 me to be grateful for what
I have or to just navel
3990.72 gaze or just to
imagine that I'm happy.
3992.763 But that's really not
what synthetic happiness
3994.68 is about at all.
3995.587 Synthetic happiness
actually has to do
3997.17 with some really important
larger principles about the way
4001.25 that our emotional
system and the way
4003.98 that the reward systems of
our brain really function.
4008.33 And they point to
important concepts
4010.55 that we're going to now discuss.
4012.26 Things like the hedonic
set point, for instance.
4015.27 Or the dopamine
system of anticipation
4017.96 of rewards versus receiving
words just as a brief insight
4021.35 into that.
4022.55 Our anticipation of
something positive
4025.19 oftentimes leads to
greater increases
4028.1 in the sorts of
neurochemicals that
4029.87 support a state of
happiness and well-being
4032.39 then the actual
acquisition of the thing
4035.78 that we're trying to obtain.
4037.04 And this goes back
to a theme I've
4038.457 discussed a few times
before in this podcast,
4041.04 in particular with my colleague
at Stanford School of Medicine,
4043.82 Dr. Anna Lembke, who wrote the
fabulous book Dopamine Nation.
4046.94 If you're interested in
dopamine and addiction,
4049.16 in particular, that's
a wonderful clear,
4052.1 and extremely informative read.
4054.83 And if you're interested
in dopamine more
4056.75 generally, not just in
the states of addiction
4059.58 but in everyday life and
in pursuit and motivation,
4062.39 The Molecule of More is an
excellent book related to that.
4065.432 And as I mentioned
earlier, we have
4066.89 this episode on dopamine
motivation and drive.
4069.68 The notion of
synthetic happiness
4073.7 is not simply about
imagining happiness,
4076.76 or thinking about happiness
or anticipating happiness.
4079.31 To some extent, it is,
but it relates to a number
4081.95 of other important themes.
4083.33 But it is grounded
very thoroughly
4085.67 in the neurobiology
of dopamine rewards.
4089.03 And I'll talk about some of that
neurobiology in a few moments.
4092.07 But I want to take
a couple of minutes
4094.7 and talk about what
synthetic happiness is
4096.92 and what some of
the conditions are
4098.66 for allowing us to
access the state
4100.729 of so-called
synthetic happiness.
4102.479 And I want to point
out at the outset
4104.6 that synthetic happiness, while
it might sound synthetic A.K.A.
4108.979 false, it's anything but.
4111.08 It actually turns out to be
among the more and perhaps
4113.99 the more potent
form of happiness
4115.85 that we can all access.
4117.109 And this is where themes
related to our control
4121.069 over our own
internal state really
4123.17 become not only valid
but very powerful.
4126.01 So, for instance, Dr.
Dan Gilbert and others
4130.38 have explored how opportunity
and choice, that is, freedom
4135.42 can and can't lead to
states of happiness.
4137.729 And the results of those studies
are very solid and, frankly,
4141.64 very surprising.
4142.95 Until you understand the
results, and once you do,
4145.83 I think you will immediately
see areas of your own life
4148.8 that you can start to
access more happiness, again
4151.8 genuine happiness,
simply by framing
4154.62 certain choices in
a particular way
4156.359 and maybe even by
eliminating choices.
4158.729 Now I'd like to focus
on the research aimed
4160.649 at understanding what increases
our levels of happiness.
4164.25 And I'd like to frame this
under the umbrella of two
4167.01 major themes.
4167.83 The first theme is
so-called natural happiness.
4170.729 Natural happiness is the sort
of happiness that most of us
4173.43 are familiar with.
4174.76 So the kind of
happiness that we expect
4176.7 to have if we, for
instance, complete a degree.
4180.479 Hopefully, a degree in a topic
meaningful and interesting
4183.149 to us but a degree nonetheless.
4185.43 Or we find a mate.
4187.59 Hopefully, a mate that we
enjoy spending time with.
4189.99 Or, for instance, making a
certain income or finding
4193.02 work that we enjoy
on a regular basis.
4195.45 All of those are
forms of happiness
4196.98 that, from a very early
time in development,
4199.44 we are taught exist.
4201.83 For instance, even
when we are very young,
4203.58 we are told that our
birthday is coming
4205.23 and that we are going
to get presents,
4206.55 and those presents
are going to be
4207.967 focused on knowledge of
things that we already enjoy.
4211.012 So if you're a little
kid, and you like trucks,
4212.97 or you're a little kid
and you like dolls,
4215.1 you can sort of expect that
those gifts will bring you
4217.92 some level of joy or happiness.
4219.69 And while that's a
small child example,
4222.54 that general notion
of natural happiness
4224.85 is, of course, one that
persists into adolescence,
4228.96 into young adulthood,
and into adulthood.
4231.58 And we quite understandably
come to associate
4235.02 this feeling of joy or happiness
with the receiving of things
4239.28 or the acquisition of
things, whether by effort,
4241.83 by gift, by inheritance,
or some other form.
4244.39 So that's natural happiness.
4245.68 And yet, as I mentioned
a little bit earlier,
4248.52 there's also this notion
of synthetic happiness.
4251.25 And some of the more interesting
and exciting research
4253.8 in the fields of psychology
and, in fact, neuroscience
4256.47 point to this idea of
synthetic happiness
4259.8 as at least as powerful
a source of happiness
4263.7 as natural happiness.
4265.38 Again, at least as powerful
and perhaps even more powerful.
4269.25 And of course, one has to take a
slightly different view of what
4272.34 happiness is in order to accept
this idea that we can create
4275.43 happiness for ourselves,
but that doesn't mean
4279.09 that the whole notion
of synthetic happiness
4281.37 is merely a passive
one where all we
4283.23 do is sit back and imagine being
happy and then we are happy.
4286.71 For better or for worse,
our nervous systems
4288.93 and our neurochemistry
simply don't work that way.
4292.21 In fact, synthetic
happiness has almost always
4294.6 been understood as
something that we
4296.43 have to put some effort
toward achieving.
4298.98 But, and this is an
important thing to point out,
4302.28 synthetic happiness
also requires
4304.71 that certain situational
or environmental conditions
4308.52 be met.
4309.99 A good example of this is some
of the work by Gillian Mandich,
4313.59 or I should say Dr.
Gillian Mandich, who's
4315.93 done some interesting work on
the conditions for creating
4319.23 happiness within our mind and
in our overall state of being.
4323.37 And she's been involved in a
number of different studies.
4326.25 But one of the ones that I
found particularly interesting
4328.89 is one in which they explored
different types of music
4333.03 and other aspects of
environmental settings.
4335.43 So you bring subjects
to the laboratory
4337.26 play them different
types of music.
4338.85 There are, in fact,
certain aspects of music
4342.12 that can create different
states of mind sadness,
4344.95 happiness, anticipation.
4346.83 In fact, there are
certain patterns of music
4348.93 that can reliably induce
anticipation of the fear
4352.77 and anxiety base type.
4354.36 So, for instance,
think the movie Jaws.
4357.12 If you recall, for those
of you who have seen Jaws,
4359.46 there's this ongoing
theme music any time
4362.79 the shark might be present in
the water or in a given scene.
4366.69 That essentially goes [HUMMING]
4369.3 Now for the musicians
out there, this
4371.1 has basis in things
like tritones and things
4373.35 that are understood
from the mathematics
4375.42 and the musical side.
4377.1 And from the
neuroscience side, are
4378.81 known to create a neural
state of anticipation.
4382.86 Yeah, a neural state
of anticipation
4384.84 and not necessarily
a positive one.
4386.88 And indeed, there are
other patterns of music
4390.12 that involve up tones.
4392.67 Think some of the music
that's typically been used
4396.75 in cartoons of various sorts.
4399.21 There's a long history of this.
4400.59 Indeed there's a
whole literature
4402.18 of psychological and now even
a smaller but still interesting
4406.41 literature on the
neuroscience of how
4408.57 certain patterns
of music can induce
4410.82 a state of joy and joyful
anticipation, in particular.
4414.21 A lot of those patterns
of music are incorporated
4416.76 into so-called happy
cartoons and Disney movies
4419.76 and things of that sort.
4421.23 In any case, Dr. Mandich and
others have explored how music,
4426.29 in particular, but other
features of the environment can
4429.59 or cannot induce
states of happiness.
4431.21 And the basic takeaway
from those studies
4433.16 is that while having a
certain environmental sound,
4438.89 musical tone, or visual feature
to a given space, a room,
4445.13 is necessary for a
state of happiness,
4448.08 it is not alone sufficient.
4449.75 What is required is that
individuals not only
4453.5 be placed into an
environment that
4455.3 contains music or visual items
or a combination of music
4460.22 and visual items that
can induce states
4462.62 of joy or happiness or
positive anticipation,
4465.56 but that they also are given
some sort of instruction
4469.55 or instruction manual as
how to synthesize happiness
4473.18 inside of that environment.
4475.65 This is important
because what this
4477.53 says is that our ability to
create states of happiness
4480.95 is dependent on our environment
but also requires effort
4484.61 from us.
4486.08 That also makes sense as to why
when we are under conditions
4489.32 of deprivation.
4490.315 So it could be
social deprivation
4491.69 or financial deprivation.
4493.28 Or even for people that are
very sensitive to whether.
4496.31 There are a certain number
of individuals, about 30%
4499.55 of people, who report feeling
very, very low under conditions
4503.3 where the sky is overcast.
4505.55 Especially if it's been
overcast for a number of days.
4507.89 The so-called seasonal
affective depression.
4510.77 Those individuals,
by the way, can often
4512.96 receive tremendous
benefits in terms
4514.82 of elevating their mood if they
make an effort to get sunlight.
4517.47 And if they can't get sunlight,
artificial light of the sort
4519.97 that we talked about earlier.
4521.49 But in any case,
there are a number
4524.36 of people that are profoundly
negatively influenced
4528.38 by the lack of positive
visual and auditory cues
4533.06 in their environment.
4534.05 But for most people,
we are in what
4537.38 I would call a
dynamic relationship
4539.27 with our environment.
4540.4 Our environment has
an effect on our mood.
4542.15 But the research
indicates that we also
4544.13 need to make some sort of
effort toward being happy.
4547.46 Now effort toward being
happy is a very vague term.
4550.89 So let's better
define what that is.
4553.01 In the case of Dr.
Mandich's work,
4555.53 this took the form of
doing so-called happiness
4558.29 inventories, right.
4560.0 That can be focusing on things
that one is grateful for,
4563.27 things that they
particularly enjoy.
4565.85 This is somewhat of a
gratitude-type practice
4569.39 but includes some
other features as well
4571.22 that are more focused
on the things that
4572.93 bring you meaning and actually
engaging in the things
4575.372 that bring you meaning.
4576.33 So if you're trying
to think about how
4577.913 to improve your levels
of happiness, what
4580.37 this research essentially
says is that you would
4583.34 be smart to try and adjust
your home environment,
4586.64 adjust your work environment
so that it is cheerful to you.
4589.288 Maybe that means a plant.
4590.33 For me, in my laboratory,
one of the things
4593.18 that was really critical
that I had as a postdoc
4595.4 and in my own laboratory when
I first started my lab was I
4600.11 love aquaria.
4600.95 So I had multiple fish tanks.
4602.36 In fact, people in my laboratory
were always rolling their eyes.
4604.37 Why do we have to have all these
fish tanks with all these--
4606.87 I like freshwater tanks,
not saltwater tanks,
4610.022 for reasons that
aren't interesting
4611.48 for this discussion.
4612.313 But freshwater tanks with discus
fish, for instance, to me,
4616.268 are just beautiful.
4617.06 They make me happy.
4617.91 I just enjoy them.
4619.37 Music is a complicated
thing in laboratories
4621.26 because it's a shared space.
4622.56 So headphones are the
general requirement.
4625.04 But having either silence
if you love silence.
4627.945 And I happen to like
working in silence
4629.57 or listening to
certain forms of music.
4631.195 I do also use the 40
Hertz binaural beats.
4634.58 Or I particularly like listening
to Glenn Gould while I work
4639.32 or listening to whale
song, believe it or not,
4641.34 while I work because it doesn't
have any structure that I
4643.04 can follow.
4643.74 I don't speak whale,
and so I can't follow.
4645.92 But it sort of fills the space
in a way that I find pleasant.
4648.53 And I've put substantial
amounts of effort
4650.78 into making my laboratory
spaces and my office
4653.69 spaces, my workspaces,
nice places to be.
4657.2 Now I had no
knowledge of this work
4659.18 from Dr. Mandich and others
at the time when I did that.
4662.092 But what I found was
that over the years,
4663.8 I was challenged in maintaining
a kind of elevated mood
4668.117 while working in a laboratory,
not because I didn't thoroughly
4670.7 enjoy the work, I love doing
experiments with my hands,
4672.992 and I loved being in lab, but
at least the labs that I was
4675.988 in as a graduate student
and post-doc there
4677.78 were no windows so I wasn't
getting adequate sunshine.
4680.39 The windows that we
didn't open, so I
4682.91 wasn't getting a lot of fresh
air, and so on and so forth.
4685.59 So I've personally
found it very valuable
4687.68 to create an environment
both at work and at home
4690.77 that I find aesthetically
pleasant, at least in some way
4694.66 or another.
4695.16 And I realize people
have varying levels
4696.827 of control over their
aesthetic environment.
4699.74 Certainly, the
auditory environment
4701.457 can be controlled nowadays
through the use of headphones
4703.79 if you're allowed to use those.
4705.082 So, for instance, using music
or using background sound
4708.38 that you find very
pleasant combined
4710.93 with a concerted
effort on your part
4713.45 to create states of happiness
by hopefully doing work that's
4718.94 meaningful to you or at least is
leading to meaningful outcomes.
4722.34 We'll talk a little
bit more about that.
4724.38 But these happiness
inventories also
4726.53 turn out to be interesting and
important sources of creating
4729.74 so-called synthetic happiness.
4731.3 And we'll also talk
about other ways
4732.8 that one can create elevated
levels of synthetic happiness.
4735.83 And I realize the word
synthetic probably
4737.6 draws up connotations
of false happiness
4740.42 or contrived happiness.
4741.77 I wish instead of calling
it synthetic happiness.
4743.9 They had called it
self-created or self-directed
4746.665 happiness or something of
that sort because then it
4748.79 wouldn't sound as false.
4750.56 Because it's simply not false.
4753.05 It leads to the
same, as far as we
4755.48 know, identical neurochemical
and psychological states
4757.73 of happiness as
natural happiness.
4759.147 And might even be
more persistent
4761.09 than natural happiness.
4762.44 It certainly, is more
under our control.
4764.63 But the key point
is that environment
4766.43 and self-directed work at
being happy are both important,
4771.56 and they interact
with one another.
4773.4 So if you're somebody who
has a hard time synthesizing
4776.0 happiness through
any of the methods
4778.16 that we talk about today, don't
consider yourself deficient.
4782.353 It could very well be that the
environment that you're in,
4784.77 social environment or
physical environment,
4786.562 or auditory environment,
is simply not
4788.25 conducive to
synthesizing happiness.
4791.118 And for that reason,
I think the work
4792.66 of Gillian Mandich and
colleagues and others
4795.12 in the field is tremendously
important because it removes us
4797.91 from this pressure to
just synthesize happiness
4801.12 from within despite
our circumstances.
4803.34 I think many of us have heard
of the incredible stories
4806.82 of people like Viktor
Frankl or Nelson Mandela who
4810.12 were stripped of
their freedom and yet
4812.28 managed to maintain some
sense of positive anticipation
4815.16 or at least some
sense of identity
4818.46 that allowed them to still
access forms of happiness.
4821.49 Those are highly unique
situations, of course.
4823.62 And they speak to the
power of the human psyche
4826.92 for synthesizing happiness
and certainly for synthesizing
4829.86 a sense that there might
be a future and to live
4832.62 into that future.
4833.67 In their cases, incredibly
impressive ways.
4836.228 But I think for most everybody,
the environment that we're in
4838.77 has a powerful
impact on our mood.
4840.93 And some people
more than others.
4843.337 I know people that are perfectly
happy with blank walls.
4845.67 No pictures on the walls.
4846.712 Other people
benefit tremendously
4848.46 from having photos or plants
in their environment and so on.
4851.8 You really have to determine
what's needed for you
4854.16 and do your best
to try and place
4855.552 those things into
your environment,
4857.01 or rather, place yourself
into an environment that
4859.26 is conducive to you
synthesizing your happiness.
4862.42 In fact, the
powerful interaction
4864.18 between our environment
and our own ability
4866.82 to generate certain
kinds of emotions
4869.85 is well established
not just for happiness
4871.81 but for things like gratitude.
4873.06 So, for instance, there's a
classic study from AMES A-M-E-S
4876.45 in 2004 that was
focused on gratitude.
4880.59 And we've had an episode
on gratitude before.
4883.23 The basic takeaway
of that episode
4884.82 is that it turns out
receiving gratitude
4888.27 is a more powerful
stimulus for the release
4893.01 of neurochemicals and activation
of brain areas associated
4895.68 with so-called
prosocial behaviors
4897.24 and feelings of well-being,
including happiness.
4900.3 But also observing stories in
the form of movies or books
4904.86 or other narratives of
other people receiving help
4907.14 is also a very powerful
stimulus for gratitude.
4909.57 Also, giving gratitude
is very powerful but not
4912.93 as powerful as receiving
gratitude, at least
4915.06 that's what the research
says, or observing
4917.01 powerful exchanges of gratitude
between other individuals.
4920.37 What the study
from AMES showed is
4922.26 that gratitude as a state
of mind and as an emotion
4926.55 does not exist in a vacuum.
4928.39 It's not independent
of our surroundings.
4931.602 So, for instance,
just writing down
4933.06 all the things you're
grateful for while it
4934.852 has some positive impact,
the impact of that
4937.44 or receiving gratitude
or observing gratitude
4939.96 is far more potent, right.
4942.42 Bigger increases in
happiness and feelings
4944.94 of well-being and indeed
neurochemicals and activation
4947.19 of brain areas associated
with happiness and well-being
4950.16 when there's a reciprocity.
4952.02 When the person receiving
understands something
4955.147 about the person
that's giving to them
4956.73 and understands that the
person is giving genuinely,
4958.897 for instance.
4959.439 So there's an
environmental interaction.
4961.105 It's not just about
receiving, it's
4962.7 receiving from somebody that you
know genuinely wants to give.
4966.21 And likewise, for the
giver in that equation,
4969.45 the feelings of
well-being are far greater
4971.97 when the person
receiving whatever
4974.55 it is money, food, assistance
in some form or another.
4978.39 Could be physical
assistance, et cetera.
4980.97 When the giver has knowledge
that the person receiving it
4984.03 genuinely needed the thing
that they are receiving.
4986.187 So the important finding within
the research, again and again,
4988.77 is that happiness doesn't
exist in a vacuum.
4992.02 It's partially our
own responsibility
4993.99 to synthesize happiness.
4994.99 You know, I was told that many
times you're like happiness
4997.407 is in your head.
4998.1 Well, yes, indeed,
it's in your head,
5000.08 but it's also dependent
on interactions
5003.5 with your environment.
5004.44 Physical environment and
social environment, and so on.
5007.14 Likewise, gratitude is something
that we can create inside of us
5011.21 right through gratitude
lists and appreciation,
5013.28 or we can give both
powerful sources
5016.19 of evoking neurochemical changes
associated with gratitude
5020.36 and happiness and well-being.
5022.34 But it, too, doesn't
exist in a vacuum.
5025.23 There's a much greater
positive effect
5027.56 when we have knowledge about
why the giver is giving us
5031.557 something or that
the person receiving
5033.14 something is going to benefit
tremendously from receiving it.
5036.21 So I'm highlighting
this because I
5038.66 think that when we hear
about synthetic happiness,
5041.57 there's a kind of automatic
erasing of context
5045.65 that tends to occur.
5046.85 And in fact, if you were to
peruse the various videos
5050.6 online or papers that exist
on PubMed around happiness
5054.68 and synthetic happiness,
in particular,
5056.45 you would come away
with the impression
5058.33 that synthetic happiness
is just something
5060.08 that we're supposed to
snap our fingers in access
5062.21 or perhaps do very
specific things in access.
5064.88 But while that is true,
context really matters.
5068.76 And I think that's
an important point.
5070.37 Much in the same way
that the point needs
5073.16 to be made that while money
doesn't buy happiness,
5076.28 money can buffer stress
and certainly offer
5078.35 opportunities that can
provide opportunities
5081.09 for more happiness.
5082.18 So I think we are starting to
arrive at a general theme here,
5085.15 which is that nothing related
to our mood exists in isolation.
5089.13 And in fact, that leads
me to a discussion
5091.35 of one of the major
scientific findings
5094.77 in the realm of what sorts
of mindsets and behaviors
5098.31 can, in fact, lead to happiness.
5100.11 And this is a paper that
was published in 2008.
5102.705 Even though that might
seem like a while ago,
5104.58 it forms the basis for a
large amount of literature
5107.1 that followed.
5107.892 It's a very
interesting literature.
5109.35 This is work from Elizabeth
Dunn and colleagues
5113.04 and was published in
the Journal Science.
5114.97 Which, again, is one of the sort
of three apex journals, Nature,
5118.11 Science, Cell, I always say
is sort of the Super Bowl, NBA
5121.735 championships, and Stanley
Cup of scientific publishing--
5124.11 very, very stringent in
terms of the number of papers
5127.32 they let in.
5128.01 Very few, that is.
5129.0 And the title of this
paper makes fairly obvious
5132.0 what the paper is about.
5133.21 The title of the paper
is "spending money
5135.54 on others promotes happiness".
5137.49 And I know a number of you
probably hear that title
5140.01 and think, oh boy, here we go.
5141.39 He's going to tell us that
giving away all our money
5144.0 is going to make us happier
than receiving money.
5146.443 And I promise you, that is not
what I'm going to tell you.
5148.86 But nonetheless, this is
a very interesting study,
5151.08 and it's one that I
think that we really
5152.747 ought to pay attention to.
5154.41 Because what the
study is based on
5156.78 is the fact that income,
provided one's income
5161.04 meets a certain
level of basic needs,
5163.47 indeed has been shown to
have only a weak effect
5167.76 on overall happiness.
5170.11 OK?
5170.61 So quoting from the paper
in the first paragraph,
5173.04 quote "income has a reliable
but surprisingly weak
5175.89 effect on happiness
within nations".
5178.14 Within nations just
mean they looked
5179.64 at this in not just
the United States,
5181.44 but a number of other
places, as well.
5184.09 "Particularly once
basic needs are met."
5186.3 OK, so if that's the
case, then what aspects
5189.63 of money and having money
are related to happiness?
5192.048 Certainly, there are people
who have a lot of money who
5194.34 are very happy.
5195.21 Certainly, there are people
who have very little money
5196.89 who are very happy.
5197.76 And of course, the
reverse is also true.
5199.645 There are plenty of people
who don't have very much money
5202.02 who are unhappy,
and in fact, there
5204.06 are people who have a lot of
money who are very unhappy.
5207.36 A point that whenever
it's made often
5210.33 leads those with less money
to kind of roll their eyes,
5213.72 because the assumption is more
money does increase happiness.
5217.16 And in fact, it doesn't.
5218.16 And later, we'll get back to
this idea of whether or how one
5223.98 acquired their money has
any impact on whether
5228.6 or not that money increases
their happiness or not.
5232.17 Let's kind of earmark
that for later.
5233.745 In the meantime, let's
talk a little bit more
5235.62 about the findings
in this paper.
5237.3 This paper is
interesting, because what
5239.94 it did is it explored something
called prosocial spending.
5243.57 Prosocial spending
is a phenomenon
5246.39 where people are taking
a certain portion
5248.67 of their income, and they
are giving it to others.
5252.15 Often for causes or for
things that they think
5255.87 are important to see
happen in the world
5257.762 or change in the world.
5258.72 That could be a hungry
individual having access
5261.51 to food or medical care.
5263.58 It could be for
environmental causes.
5265.35 It could be for animal wellness.
5266.942 It could be for any number
of different things.
5268.9 It could even be
giving somebody money
5270.84 so that they can buy themselves
a gift or giving somebody money
5273.78 and not having any understanding
or expectation of what they're
5277.62 going to do with the money.
5279.27 Again, one of the central
themes around gratitude
5282.24 is that while
receiving is great,
5286.68 giving is also great in terms of
increasing sense of well-being.
5290.7 And one of the more
important features to that
5293.79 is when we give, either
in the form of words
5297.72 or in the form of
resources, knowledge
5300.89 that the person
receiving benefits
5304.32 from that in some
real way, greatly
5306.45 increases the
chance that there's
5309.03 an increase in happiness for the
giver, as well as the receiver.
5313.098 Again, that's a note
about gratitude,
5314.64 but not an insignificant one
as it relates to the study.
5317.53 So what the study found was
that higher prosocial spending
5320.85 was associated
with significantly
5322.5 greater happiness.
5323.34 This was a very statistically
significant effect.
5326.16 And they found that the
effects of income and prosocial
5329.43 spending were independent
and similar in magnitude.
5334.398 Independent and
similar in magnitude.
5335.94 I'll explain what
that means for those
5337.523 of you that might be confused
by that statement in just
5340.02 a moment.
5340.71 Whereas, quote, "personal
spending remained
5343.56 unrelated to happiness".
5345.22 So what this study
basically found
5346.77 was if people are allotted
a certain amount of money
5351.24 to give away, and one
adjusts for overall income,
5356.483 and this is
important, because you
5357.9 could imagine that for some
individual giving away $2,000
5362.43 might represent a
significant portion
5364.62 of their yearly
or monthly income.
5366.63 And for another individual it
might represent a tiny fraction
5370.11 of their income.
5371.19 But when you adjust for
income level, what you find
5375.54 is that people who
gave away money
5379.46 benefited tremendously in
terms of their own increase
5382.97 in happiness.
5384.48 In fact, quote, "employees who
devoted more of their bonuses
5387.89 to prosocial spending,
that is giving way
5389.81 more money, experience greater
happiness after receiving
5392.54 the bonus, and the manner in
which they spent that bonus was
5395.75 a more important predictor
of their happiness
5397.64 than the size of
the bonus itself".
5399.77 This was an actual
experiment they ran
5401.36 with real income, real money.
5404.065 I'm going to read
that again just
5405.44 to make sure it hits
home, because I found
5407.19 this to be really impactful.
5410.13 "Employees who devoted a
greater fraction of their bonus
5414.0 to prosocial spending, that is
giving away money to others,
5418.56 experienced greater happiness
after receiving the bonus.
5421.8 And the manner in
which they spent
5423.39 that bonus was a more important
predictor of their happiness
5426.15 than the size of
the bonus itself."
5427.87 So the actual bonus, the
receiving of the money,
5430.74 led to greater increases in
happiness if they gave it away.
5435.63 And the act of giving
it away itself,
5439.08 led to greater
increases in happiness
5441.36 than receiving the bonus.
5443.44 So it's a twofer,
as you might say.
5445.62 So the takeaway from this
study and studies like it,
5448.65 I think is pretty obvious that
to the extent that we can.
5451.78 And again, when I say to
the extent that we can,
5453.99 this means whatever
percentage of our own income
5457.59 that we can afford to give away,
or if we don't have income,
5460.96 the percentage of our effort.
5462.99 I mean this is about money,
but it's also about effort.
5465.39 We can help others, right?
5466.74 You can serve in food kitchens,
you can do community gardening,
5471.99 you can pick up trash, you
can do any number of things.
5475.2 You can assist a
neighbor with child care
5477.54 or you can assist a neighbor
who is physically less
5480.36 able to retrieve their
paper, et cetera, et cetera.
5482.91 The point is that
giving resources,
5486.66 certainly in the form of money,
but also in the form of effort
5490.68 and time, is immensely
beneficial for synthesizing
5494.91 our own happiness.
5496.23 That is for the
giver, us, to increase
5498.99 our levels of happiness.
5500.25 But the degree of increase
in our own happiness
5503.67 is proportional in
some way to the extent
5507.36 to which the person receiving
actually needed that help
5511.08 and registers that help.
5512.67 Excellent research
also points to the fact
5515.22 that another potent
way to synthesize
5518.13 happiness, that is to create
genuine states of happiness
5521.25 in ourselves, is to leverage
the so-called focus system.
5525.66 Or rather, I should say to
de-emphasize the tendency
5529.32 of our minds to wander.
5531.107 There's an excellent paper
on this, also published
5533.19 in the Journal Science.
5534.148 This is now a classic paper.
5535.38 I talked a little bit about it
in the episode on meditation,
5537.88 but for those of you
that did or perhaps
5539.91 didn't hear that episode, I
just want to briefly touch
5542.82 on a few aspects of the paper.
5545.31 And in particular, a few aspects
of the paper that I didn't talk
5549.102 about previously.
5549.81 And the title of
this paper, again,
5551.64 is a very
straightforward in terms
5553.14 of telling you what it's about.
5554.55 And that is, "A wandering
mind is an unhappy mind"
5558.57 by Killingsworth and Gilbert.
5560.64 This paper was published
in Science in 2010,
5562.663 and we will provide
a link to the paper.
5564.33 This is frankly, a
very interesting paper.
5566.55 This paper involved
several subjects,
5568.92 or I should say,
2,250 adult subjects.
5572.34 And what they were
able to do was
5574.23 to contact these
subjects while they
5575.73 were going about living
their daily lives
5578.07 and ask them both
what they were doing
5580.17 and what they were feeling.
5581.602 Some additional questions
that they asked them,
5583.56 but they were able to
establish whether or not
5586.5 people were watching television
or doing housework or working
5590.55 on a home computer or resting or
listening to music, et cetera,
5594.6 in their natural environment.
5595.93 So this is outside
the laboratory.
5597.51 And they were able to
assess to what extent
5601.08 those people were happy
or unhappy or neutral,
5605.49 or had some other
emotional state at the time
5607.977 when they were engaging in any
number of different activities.
5610.56 And they assessed whether or
not those individuals were also
5614.88 focused on or focused away
from whatever activity they
5618.0 were engaging in.
5618.96 And the takeaways from
this study are many,
5621.03 but for sake of today's
discussion, what
5624.18 I think is especially
interesting
5626.34 is that regardless
of whether or not
5629.28 people were engaging in
activities that they enjoyed
5632.46 or not, the tendency for their
mind to wander from an activity
5637.77 predicted lower
levels of happiness
5639.99 than if they tended to be
focused on the activity
5642.18 they were engaged in.
5643.71 Now that itself
should be surprising.
5646.48 I mean, what that says
is that even if somebody
5649.2 was engaged in activity
like cleaning their house
5651.6 or doing homework or reading
something that they weren't
5654.6 enjoying, if they were focused
on what they were doing,
5658.09 they tended to report as happier
than if their mind was drifting
5662.73 elsewhere.
5663.61 Now this also points to the
idea that perhaps our minds
5666.57 drift to unpleasant thoughts
more than pleasant thoughts.
5669.09 But they also addressed
that in the study.
5671.43 Point I'd like to
make here is quote
5672.93 "although people's
minds were more
5674.43 likely to wander
to pleasant topics
5677.43 than to unpleasant topics"
and there the difference
5679.753 is pretty significant.
5680.67 People's minds tended to
wander to pleasant topics
5684.18 about 43% of the time as
opposed to unpleasant topics
5688.08 about 27% of the time.
5689.91 Or to neutral topics and the
remaining 31% of samples.
5694.02 "People were no
happier when thinking
5696.3 about pleasant topics than
about their current activity".
5700.6 Think about that.
5701.62 "People were no
happier than when
5703.18 thinking about pleasant things
then their current activity".
5706.25 In fact, the mere focus
on what they were doing
5709.6 was more powerful
than anything else,
5712.97 even if they didn't enjoy
what they were doing.
5715.31 So they go on here to say, quote
"although negative moods are
5717.97 known to cause mind
wandering, I now
5720.4 see strongly suggested that
mind wandering was generally
5723.28 the cause, the
cause, and not merely
5725.92 the consequence of unhappiness."
5728.09 So there are a lot of
aspects of this study that
5730.09 are worth going into.
5731.32 But the major takeaway, or the
one that perhaps we should all
5735.1 be most concerned with,
is that when we are not
5737.98 focused on what we
are doing, we tend
5739.66 to be far less happy
than when we are
5741.88 focused on what we are doing.
5743.237 Even if what we are
doing is something
5744.82 that we don't deem
very pleasant.
5746.395 And certainly, if we
are engaged in something
5748.27 that we consider very pleasant
and we are very focused on,
5750.837 well then our levels of
happiness are the highest.
5752.92 That's sort of obvious.
5754.12 But what this really speaks
to is the tremendous power
5757.63 of building our ability to
focus on what we're doing.
5761.62 And to stay present
to what we are doing.
5763.493 Now this whole notion
of staying present
5765.16 is one that itself is a
little bit complicated.
5767.39 And in the episode on meditation
I talked a little bit about
5769.93 whether or not it's
beneficial to be
5771.85 present to our
internal state, or that
5775.18 is our inter receptive state.
5777.34 Our feelings of our heart
rate and how full or empty
5781.6 our gut feels or our state of
being from our skin inward,
5785.35 or whether or not
we should focus
5786.965 on being present to things in
our immediate surroundings.
5789.34 Both our versions
of being quote,
5790.75 unquote "present"
as you can imagine.
5793.1 But in the one case,
we're focused internally,
5795.94 in the other we're
focused externally,
5797.71 and of course, most
of the time it's
5799.21 some combination of the two.
5800.493 But what this study
really says is
5801.91 that any practice that can
powerfully impact our ability
5805.63 to remain present in the
activity we are engaged in,
5809.955 could even be a
phone call, could
5811.33 be texting for that matter,
could be social media
5814.032 for that matter, right?
5814.99 We're not placing judgment
on the activity here.
5817.1 In fact, what we're
really talking about
5818.767 is the enormous happiness
increasing value
5822.04 of being present to what
we're doing regardless
5824.68 of what we are doing.
5825.88 And a practice that's known to
be beneficial for increasing
5828.94 our ability to focus
is, among other things,
5832.76 a short meditation practice.
5835.31 In fact, work from Wendy
Suzuki's lab at NYU,
5838.12 again, Wendy's been a
guest on this podcast.
5840.13 Her laboratory has
shown that even
5842.02 a very brief meditation
of about 13 minutes,
5845.11 and this would be the
sort of quote unquote
5846.97 "classic" type of
meditation of eyes
5849.07 closed, focusing
on one's breathing.
5851.02 Even a very brief meditation
of just 13 minutes
5853.75 or so done consistently,
so ideally, every day.
5858.31 But I have to imagine that
even if you skip a day,
5860.9 there are still benefits.
5862.12 That sort of
meditation can greatly
5864.37 enhance one's ability to focus.
5865.99 In her studies,
that was also shown
5868.06 that sort of brief meditation
could also greatly enhance
5872.02 mood and sleep and
various aspects
5874.698 of cognitive performance.
5875.74 And work from my laboratory,
in collaboration with Dr. David
5878.5 Spiegel at Stanford,
department of psychiatry
5880.99 has shown that even briefer
meditations of even just five
5884.21 minutes per day can have fairly
outsized positive effects
5887.62 on a number of different
parameters, as well.
5889.66 Those very brief
types of meditations,
5892.36 because they really are
focusing and more accurately,
5895.96 I should say,
refocusing exercises.
5898.24 When you do that sort of
activity of closing your eyes
5901.09 and forcing yourself
to focus and refocus
5903.61 on your breath and
internal state,
5905.56 that is directing your
perception inward.
5907.36 Or if you choose, you
could deliberately
5910.39 focus your perception
on some external object
5912.79 or sound, for that matter.
5916.06 When one does that, the circuits
of the brain involved in focus
5919.72 dramatically improve.
5921.49 That is they rewire and
increase their ability for you
5925.3 to achieve focus.
5927.37 Many of us have heard about
meditation, many of us
5929.77 think about meditation as
a "mindfulness" exercise.
5933.13 Mindfulness in quotes, because
that itself needs definition.
5935.71 But I prefer to view
meditations of the sort
5939.55 that I just described
as perceptual or focus
5942.7 based training, which is
really what the data point to.
5946.48 Notions around consciousness
and states of mind
5948.46 are very hard to define, but
it's very clear that even
5952.03 a 5 minute a day or ideally,
an up to a 13 minute a day
5955.3 meditation can greatly
increase our ability to focus.
5958.6 And based on the
findings in this paper,
5961.09 "A wandering mind is an unhappy
mind" also make it very clear
5964.72 that the ability to
refocus again and again
5968.26 and again on what we're
doing throughout our day,
5971.26 regardless of what
we're doing, can
5973.24 have a very dramatic, in fact,
a statistically significant
5977.53 increase on our levels
of overall happiness.
5980.057 So what else does
the research tell us
5981.64 we can do to increase our
levels of genuine happiness?
5985.36 Well, it's very clear based
on the longitudinal study
5988.66 from Harvard, as well
as the Yale happiness
5991.78 project and the work of
numerous laboratories in the US
5995.23 and elsewhere, that
quality social connection
5999.41 is extremely powerful
in terms of its ability
6002.86 to increase our
levels of happiness.
6005.56 What is quality
social connection?
6007.78 Quality social connection
falls into a number
6010.75 of different bins.
6011.74 This can be romantic connection,
this can be friendship,
6014.77 this can even be
coworker or just
6016.99 daily superficial
interaction type connections.
6020.47 That's surprising
to a lot of people,
6022.447 because I think a lot of people
hear quality social connection
6025.03 and they think
deep conversation.
6027.1 But it's very clear
from the research
6029.5 that oftentimes our
conversations with people
6033.04 that we are closest to are
actually quite shallow.
6036.163 If you think about it, if you've
been in a romantic relationship
6038.83 or a friendship for a
long period of time,
6040.67 or maybe even a sibling
relationship or other family
6042.88 relationship, much of
what you talk about
6045.79 is fairly superficial
or fairly trivial.
6049.73 In fact, it's often a
sharing of the trivial day
6052.33 to day things between two
people or through groups
6055.78 of people that
leads to the feeling
6058.3 that people are really
connected to one another.
6060.46 In particular, if it's involving
shared experiences of any kind,
6063.82 good or bad.
6065.48 So there's an extensive
literature on social connection
6068.32 and how to build
social connection.
6069.91 This certainly
should be the topic
6071.53 of a full episode
of this podcast
6073.52 in the not too distant future.
6075.05 But because social connection
can have such a powerful impact
6078.34 on our states of happiness
and overall well-being,
6081.79 I want to emphasize a few
features of social connection
6085.15 that I think most people
might not appreciate.
6087.4 Once again, when we hear
quality social connection,
6090.14 I think most of us tend to
think about deep, meaningful
6092.86 conversation or long walks
on the beach or camping trips
6096.16 together or travel together.
6097.52 And while all of those
certainly qualify
6099.46 as wonderful opportunities
for social connection,
6103.24 opportunities for
quality social connection
6105.49 are certainly not limited to
those kinds of interactions.
6108.53 In fact, I can recall times
in my graduate career,
6112.25 so this would be times when I
was living in the laboratory.
6114.88 Because that was a significant
portion of my graduate years.
6117.79 And one of the more important
social connections for me
6121.03 was the staff that worked there
in the wee hours of the night
6124.96 and that came in very
early in the morning.
6126.89 So one of the more regular
social connections I had is I
6129.94 would brush my teeth in
the hallway bathroom.
6133.18 And there was no one else
really around at that time,
6136.04 except for the
janitors that tended
6137.83 to leave early in the morning.
6139.48 They had worked a good
portion of the night.
6141.37 Or that were arriving
very early in the day.
6143.662 And the fact that I would
see them on a regular basis
6145.87 and maybe exchange a few
words about their work
6147.67 or their families or the
holidays, actually for me,
6149.92 became very meaningful.
6151.42 In part, because my social
connections at the time
6153.82 were really limited to
only social connections
6156.16 that I had in the
context of work.
6158.38 Now some people might look
at my schedule at that time
6161.29 and look at my life at
that time and say, well,
6163.31 that was very unhealthy.
6164.68 You were lacking in
certain number of ways.
6167.35 But frankly, looking
back, and at the time,
6169.87 and I know this because
I journaled at the time,
6172.03 I was exceedingly
happy, at least
6173.86 for that stage of my life.
6175.27 At that stage of
my life, I wanted
6176.86 to be focused primarily on
doing experiments and immersing
6181.6 myself in my
scientific training.
6183.94 And for me, the even seemingly
insignificant interactions
6187.93 of talking to the
janitor in the morning
6191.03 or some of the other regular
staff was not insignificant.
6193.85 In fact, for me it
was very significant.
6195.68 And over the holidays when
their hours were reduced,
6197.99 I actually missed
them quite a lot.
6199.58 And even as I talk
about this, I can
6201.08 recall the feelings
of well-being
6202.7 of just seeing familiar faces.
6204.377 And that brings up an
important point, which
6206.21 is there's quite extensive
literature pointing to the fact
6210.2 that when we see faces,
especially faces in the morning
6214.37 and in the late afternoon,
there is a positive impact
6218.75 on the emotional circuitry.
6220.29 Or I should say, the
circuitry of the brain that
6222.29 underlies emotional well-being.
6224.39 And that shouldn't
come as surprising.
6226.43 We as old world primates,
much like other primates,
6230.15 are very dependent on faces
and facial expressions
6233.81 in terms of registering
our own place in life
6237.33 and our emotional state.
6239.21 Now the origins
of this are many.
6240.95 In particular, we
have a brain area,
6243.44 it's actually called
the fusiform face gyrus.
6245.425 This is an area
of the brain that
6246.8 was largely
discovered by a woman
6249.38 by Nancy Kanwisher at MIT.
6251.51 And the Kanwisher lab
has done extensive work
6254.36 showing that this
brain area that's
6256.76 dedicated to the processing
of faces, and not just faces
6261.41 in real life, but faces
on computer screens
6264.47 and elsewhere, are
intimately tied
6267.2 to areas of the brain that are
associated with emotionality.
6269.78 That's actually a work
from another laboratory,
6271.738 Dorsal's laboratory at
Caltech, now at Uc Berkeley,
6274.19 has shown that this
face processing
6276.38 area in the brain in both
non-human primates and primates
6281.24 is directly linked to
the areas of our brain
6284.66 that associate with
anxiety and fear.
6287.18 But also, areas
of the brain that
6288.59 are associated with well-being.
6290.03 So it comes as no
surprise that when
6291.77 we see faces, in
particular, friendly faces,
6293.99 even if we have just brief
interactions with those faces,
6296.78 and even if no
words are exchanged,
6298.97 that creates the
sense of social bond.
6301.43 And it creates a sense
of predictability.
6303.65 And I raise this again because
I think a lot of people
6305.9 think that social
connection always
6307.61 has to come in the form of
close friendships, which
6310.63 of course are wonderful.
6311.63 Or close romantic relationships,
which of course, are wonderful.
6314.03 Or close family relationships,
which of course, are wonderful.
6316.77 But as we'll soon discuss
in our model of happiness,
6320.48 or how to achieve
happiness based
6322.07 on the scientific
literature in a few minutes,
6325.79 social connection can and
should come in various forms.
6329.72 And when I say
various forms, I mean
6331.64 forms of brief interaction,
more superficial interaction,
6335.48 and forms of deeper interaction.
6338.06 All of those are relevant
to our states of happiness.
6340.52 And there's research to
support that daily interactions
6343.85 with somebody at a cafe or
just a brief hello or a smile.
6347.9 Provided that we
are both present,
6350.06 or we make the effort to be
present to those interactions,
6353.07 however brief they are,
can have a positive effect
6355.94 on people's overall well-being.
6357.26 And not just in that
moment, but consistently.
6360.47 Evidenced by the
fact, I think, that
6362.21 when I look back on
those years of working
6364.34 long hours in the laboratory and
essentially restricting myself
6368.27 either to exercising,
sleeping, eating or working.
6372.68 Again, that's what I wanted
at that stage of my life.
6375.17 Certainly, not the way
I live my life now.
6376.92 But that's what I wanted
that stage of my life.
6379.08 That even those
seemingly insignificant
6381.41 social interactions
were important to me
6384.23 and had a potent
impact on increasing
6386.69 my level of happiness.
6387.62 And frankly, still do.
6388.77 And I feel that right now.
6390.38 That said, I think all of us
can appreciate the immense value
6393.98 of social connection that is of
the more long lasting, and for
6398.09 lack of a better
word, richer type,
6399.93 whether or not that is with
siblings or with parents
6403.25 or with friends or
with romantic partners.
6405.92 For that reason, I want
to emphasize a little bit
6408.32 about what
constitutes connection
6410.78 and what constitutes
social connection.
6412.43 There are basically two
forms of social connection
6414.56 that have been studied
and I'll review both,
6417.11 as it relates to increasing
our levels of happiness.
6419.6 And the first one is
presence and eye contact,
6422.48 and the second is
physical contact.
6424.68 So in terms of presence
and eye contact
6426.71 there's been a lot
of studies about
6428.84 whether or not people
exchange direct eye contact
6431.9 during conversation or not,
dictating whether or not
6435.23 each individual in
that interaction
6438.38 feels as if they
had a connection.
6441.05 Now again, keep in mind that
while we think of connection
6444.23 as relating to some deep
or meaningful conversation,
6446.87 and oftentimes that
can be the case.
6448.37 Think for instance, an excellent
therapist patient relationship.
6452.99 Or an excellent
romantic relationship.
6455.18 Or an excellent friendship
where you really feel
6458.3 heard and understood, or
at least to the extent
6460.46 that people are
willing to explore
6462.19 certain topics with you.
6463.19 You're willing to hear
them and listen really
6465.065 carefully for what
they're saying,
6466.482 and they're willing to hear and
listen to what you're saying
6469.04 in an attempt to understand.
6470.57 That certainly can enhance
the sense of social connection
6473.06 leading to what people would
call social bonds leading
6475.94 to increased happiness.
6477.41 But eye contact is also known
to be an important feature.
6482.03 The thing about eye
contact is that most people
6484.13 assume that a lot
of eye contact,
6486.44 and in fact,
ongoing eye contact,
6488.42 is critical to a
sense of connection.
6491.57 And in fact, that's
not the case.
6493.25 There's a recent paper that I
find really interesting that
6496.577 was published in
Proceedings of the National
6498.41 Academy of Sciences in 2021.
6501.14 The title of this
paper is "Eye contact
6503.33 marks the rise and fall
of shared attention
6505.64 in conversation".
6506.67 I find this paper interesting
for a number of reasons.
6508.92 First of all, my laboratory
works on internal states
6511.79 and vision, so it
relates directly
6513.38 to the work that
my laboratory does.
6515.21 But also, that it
violates what I thought
6517.97 was a general rule of
social connection, which
6520.49 is this idea that two people
needed to be focused on one
6522.98 another, that is
looking at one another
6525.23 directly and fairly consistently
throughout a conversation
6528.74 in order for the feeling
of connection to emerge.
6531.17 But it turns out
that's not the case.
6533.335 And in fact, just to give
you the takeaway and then
6535.46 I'll flesh it out a little bit
with some data, eye contact,
6540.29 or I should say mutual
eye contact, so two people
6543.448 registering the presence of the
other person looking at them.
6545.99 You're looking at me
and I'm looking at you.
6547.64 If you're watching
this on YouTube,
6549.098 then perhaps we are actually
doing this at that moment.
6552.223 And if you're
listening, just know
6553.64 that I'm looking
directly into the camera
6555.05 as I'm saying this
at this moment.
6556.467 If we were to be looking
directly at one another,
6559.82 that, it turns out,
signals the next step,
6563.64 which is that it's very likely
that we will each both look
6567.29 away.
6568.35 And that turns out to
be a way in which we set
6571.49 and reset attention continually
during conversation.
6575.083 So again, I really
like this study
6576.5 because of the high fidelity.
6578.73 The high temporal precision.
6580.52 That is, the precision
over time at which they
6582.77 looked at eye contact and
engagement of attention
6588.02 between individuals.
6589.34 And they did this by looking
at things like pupil size
6591.955 and of course
where the eyes were
6593.33 looking and so on and so forth.
6594.665 The basic takeaway of this
study was the following.
6596.79 And here I'm quoting
from the study.
6598.29 Quote "Rather than
maximizing shared attention,
6601.49 good conversation
may require shifts
6603.77 in and out of shared states
accompanied by eye contact".
6607.52 So what this basically
says is that when
6610.61 two people are
involved in a very,
6613.125 let's call it an
intimate conversation,
6614.75 but the word intimate
should not be misconstrued
6617.69 to mean something about
intimacy or sexual intimacy
6620.33 or physical intimacy.
6621.71 Just a conversation
in which both people
6623.99 feel present to the
conversation and focused
6627.32 on that conversation and that
conversation and its contents
6630.02 only.
6630.95 The tendency is for people
to take turns talking,
6633.84 although sometimes,
depending on the individuals
6635.84 they might interrupt
more or less.
6637.58 Again, interrupting can
be a sign of interest,
6640.37 it doesn't always have
to be rude, by the way.
6642.63 But they're sharing information.
6645.29 Hopefully, about a common
topic or set of topics.
6648.5 They will at some moment
look at one another.
6651.503 That's what the study shows.
6652.67 And that after briefly
gazing directly at one
6655.7 another, attention peaks,
and then they will look away,
6659.81 and attention will get reduced.
6661.67 And then the
conversation consists
6663.74 of a series of focusing back
on one another with their eyes,
6668.51 and then focusing off,
focusing on and focusing off.
6670.94 And those mutual
eye contact moments
6673.94 actually predict the
breaking of attention.
6676.73 So it's this ramping up
of attention and braking
6678.858 of attention.
6679.4 Ramping of attention and
braking of attention.
6681.56 I think these are important
results because they violate
6683.96 this stereotype or assumption
that deep social connection
6687.68 of the sort leading
to happiness always
6691.04 involves ongoing eye
contact or ongoing focus.
6695.18 Just as with meditation, just
as with any activity, frankly,
6699.65 we undergo shifts in
attention and focus.
6703.58 That is focus ramps up and
then it breaks, and then
6706.55 it re-engages.
6707.24 It ramps up it breaks,
and then it re-engages.
6709.88 And that, it turns
out, is the basis
6712.28 of in-depth connected
conversation.
6715.17 So for those of you that
are interested in creating
6717.65 social connection
in any context,
6721.11 and in particular for sake
of increasing happiness,
6724.02 because it's very clear
that social connections,
6726.75 even if they are fairly
superficial social connections,
6729.39 can increase our
sense of happiness.
6731.34 Seeing faces is important.
6733.29 Ideally, faces in person,
although I suppose these days,
6736.08 over Zoom or over other
screen type medium
6739.53 would be a close second.
6741.61 But the point is that if you
want to increase happiness
6745.47 you need to have quality
social connections.
6747.303 And if you want to have
quality social connections
6749.387 you need to be
present and engage
6751.053 in those social connections.
6752.22 And that requires a viewing
of each other's faces,
6756.33 ideally, which is not to say
that a phone call or text
6759.42 exchange can't be meaningful.
6761.14 But that faces are really
the most powerful way
6764.07 to engage in social contact.
6765.99 And that eye contact, not
consistent eye contact,
6769.56 but eye contact of the sort
that builds up and then breaks
6772.08 and builds up and breaks
across the interaction
6774.09 is going to be the best way
that we are aware of to feel
6779.46 that one had a real connection.
6781.41 This should also
remove any pressure
6782.91 that you might feel to
constantly look at somebody
6785.58 or to be completely eyes
open staring at them
6788.095 without blinking or diverting
your attention at any point
6790.47 during a conversation.
6791.85 This also frankly,
is an opportunity
6794.07 where if somebody says, hey,
you're not paying attention
6797.61 because you look away,
that you may actually
6800.67 be engaging in what is
the more typical form
6802.86 of healthy connection.
6803.91 I talked about this long ago
on an episode about focus.
6806.693 It turns out when
we are listening
6808.11 very intently to
somebody and trying
6809.872 to remember the information
they're telling us,
6811.83 we will often close our eyes.
6813.332 And that's not a form of lack
of attention, that's actually
6815.79 a form of attending in.
6817.05 Because we have so much of
our brain devoted to vision.
6820.41 When 40% of our brain
is devoted to vision
6822.87 in some way or another,
when we close our eyes,
6824.89 we can actually devote
more attentional resources
6827.28 to remembering the specifics
of what people are telling us.
6830.25 But again, please don't
go through conversations
6832.62 with your eyes closed
the entire time.
6834.31 I think that would certainly
not be conducive to building
6837.39 social connection.
6838.33 So we know that faces are
important for social connection
6841.71 as it relates to
synthetic happiness.
6844.29 And we know that eye contact is
really important for building
6847.32 social connection.
6849.67 Physical contact
is also important
6852.52 for social connection.
6853.54 And not just romantic or
sexual type connection.
6857.0 In fact, there is a form
of physical connection
6859.48 that is present
in other primates.
6862.84 In fact, it's present as far
as we know, in all mammals.
6865.96 And is also very much a feature
of the human nervous system.
6871.06 And that's something
called allogrooming.
6872.868 I have to imagine that
most people probably
6874.66 haven't heard of allogrooming.
6876.077 The reason I'm
bringing up alogrooming
6877.66 is that it stems from a
fairly extensive literature
6881.08 about the prosocial,
pro happiness
6885.31 effects of pets on humans.
6887.783 In fact, if you want
to read up on this,
6889.45 there is a paper out of Yale
University on this topic
6892.81 that was published in 2018.
6893.98 The title of the paper is
"The influence of interactions
6896.313 with dogs on affect", OK
emotion, "anxety and arousal
6900.368 in children".
6900.91 And it references
some other studies
6902.57 that were performed on humans.
6903.82 And the basic takeaway is
that these so-called AAAs,
6907.27 animal assisted activities,
represent a really potent way
6912.01 to increase people,
including children's feelings
6915.43 of well-being.
6916.21 Now what's interesting
about this to me
6918.58 is that dogs
themselves don't really
6922.0 have to do much except be
present in the room in order
6925.99 for these positive effects, that
is, the reductions in anxiety,
6929.86 increases in happiness,
et cetera, to occur.
6932.2 And in fact, they can
be very, very brief.
6934.317 As they describe in the
paper, "brief unstructured
6936.4 interactions with
an unfamiliar dog",
6938.14 so you don't even
need to know this dog,
6940.03 "after exposure to a moderate
stressor showed higher positive
6943.3 affect relevant to participants
who received a soothing object
6946.69 or waited for the
same amount of time."
6948.53 So just even seeing a dog
for a brief amount of time
6952.24 has been shown to reduce
stress and improve happiness,
6956.26 or I should say,
increase feelings
6957.91 of happiness
overall then a child
6961.66 receiving a soothing object.
6963.293 Which was, at least for me, a
little bit counterintuitive.
6965.71 I would have thought
that children receiving
6967.03 a soothing object
would have been
6968.405 the more powerful stimulus.
6970.76 But in fact, it wasn't, at
least not in this study.
6973.198 The real question I think we
should be asking ourselves
6975.49 is, what is it about
interactions with others
6978.52 and with other animals
that could potentially
6981.22 have this prosocial
happiness enhancing effect?
6984.95 And the reason I
raise this is also
6987.1 because I think many people
are interested in either owning
6991.66 or having interactions with
pets as a way to improve
6993.992 their feelings of well-being.
6995.2 And I say having
interactions with because I
6998.35 myself am a good example
of somebody who wasn't
7000.84 always able to have pets.
7003.183 So when I was a graduate
student in a postdoc,
7005.1 I very much wanted a dog.
7006.672 Very, very, very
much wanted a dog.
7008.13 In fact, there was a rule
in my family at some point
7010.297 that I wasn't allowed to talk
about dogs anymore because I
7013.172 was talking about all
the breeds of dogs.
7014.88 Going to dog breeders,
examining different breeds,
7018.27 going to the pound, et cetera.
7020.31 The point was that I was
obsessed with getting a dog,
7023.43 but I knew I wasn't in a good
position to own a dog yet.
7025.8 I didn't have the finances, I
didn't have the correct living
7028.3 situation and so on.
7030.27 Eventually, I did
own a dog, of course.
7032.335 But at the time I couldn't.
7033.46 So what I would do is every
Sunday I would go to a place
7035.952 where they fostered dogs
and they needed dog walkers.
7038.16 And I would walk their dog.
7039.285 I would also walk
my neighbor's dogs.
7042.33 I didn't charge them for it.
7043.54 In fact, I felt like I was
being paid by getting time
7046.14 with those dogs.
7047.04 And in fact, I put an ad
at that time on Craigslist
7049.5 that I would walk
people's dogs for free,
7051.57 and only a few people
took that seriously.
7053.49 But of the ones that did,
I had a great little cadre
7056.4 of dog owners that would allow
me to take their dogs out
7058.92 and I was super happy.
7060.03 It just made me
very, very happy.
7061.93 And I really enjoyed it.
7064.17 And frankly, it was a
great opportunity for me
7067.23 to also get to the various dog
breeds and the different dog
7070.08 temperaments and to learn a bit
about my ability to interact
7072.99 with dogs in a certain way.
7074.613 I actually got to be a
pretty good dog walker.
7076.53 Unfortunately, later
I got a bulldog.
7077.91 And it turns out
no matter how good
7078.96 a dog walker you are, Bulldogs
just simply don't like to walk.
7081.94 In fact, if you've ever
walked up to a bulldog
7084.0 and you've offered to
scratch or pet that dog,
7086.55 you'll notice that
Bulldogs love that.
7088.6 And I would argue, having
been a bulldog owner,
7091.8 that they like it because it's
an opportunity for them to stop
7094.41 moving.
7094.988 But that's more about
the bulldog than what
7096.78 I'm about to tell
you next, which
7098.155 is this principle of
so-called allogrooming.
7101.19 Allogrooming is a
pattern of behavior
7103.14 that's observed in essentially
all mammals but very strongly
7106.98 in nonhuman primates
and primates,
7109.98 where individuals within a
species touch one another.
7116.26 And this is non-sexual touch.
7117.93 So this would be someone
brushing somebody else's hair
7122.25 or combing their hair or even
using a lint roller on them,
7125.68 for instance.
7126.58 Or someone grooming
somebody else.
7129.66 Now typically, one needs
to have an established
7132.33 relationship with this person.
7133.66 So it could be a professional
type relationship
7135.42 where this is a barber
cutting somebody's
7137.128 hair or a hairdresser cutting
or styling somebody's hair.
7141.612 It could be somebody
giving someone
7143.07 a manicure or a pedicure.
7144.51 Could be somebody doing skin
care or massage for somebody
7146.94 in a professional context.
7148.44 Or it could be two
people who have agreed
7150.81 that it is appropriate
for the context
7153.205 and for the relationship
for one person
7154.83 to be grooming somebody else.
7157.11 Can even, believe it or not
there's literature on this,
7159.6 can even extend into
the realm of people
7162.93 sort of cleaning and
picking off other people.
7165.21 Now when we see
this in primates,
7167.58 it seems like a very cute and
sort of almost understandable
7171.82 behavior.
7172.32 We can see these
pictures online.
7173.85 If you look them up, you can
just look up allogrooming
7176.1 and you'll see vast
number of pictures
7178.38 of for instance, baboons
picking little things out
7180.66 of each other's hair.
7182.52 Or grooming and kind of
perusing one another,
7186.61 to find things,
presumably parasites
7189.53 or like little bits
of plants or something
7191.28 like that they want
to remove from them.
7192.947 Allogrooming is
known to stimulate
7195.87 a certain category of neurons
called the C tactile fibers.
7199.51 These are a particular category
of so-called sensory neurons
7202.62 that innervate our skin.
7203.89 So these are literally like
little endings of neurons,
7206.88 little wires that
end up in the skin,
7209.01 that when they are
touched lightly
7211.47 tend to create a
feeling of well-being
7214.302 in the person that's
being touched.
7215.76 Again, this is
consensual touch that's
7217.71 very context appropriate.
7219.3 But it's known to
increase levels
7222.36 of oxytocin, a kind of hormone
slash neurotransmitter.
7226.21 It's both, really.
7227.46 That is known to evoke
feelings of bond.
7231.06 Or of feeling bonded to
somebody or something.
7234.24 And for many people
we hear about oxytocin
7236.61 and we think about the bond
between parent and child,
7240.05 in particular mother
and infant where it's
7241.8 been most extensively studied.
7243.06 Or between two members
of a romantic couple.
7245.58 But if you look at the
literature on allogrooming,
7247.84 what you find is that when
humans groom one another,
7250.95 the increases in oxytocin
that are experienced
7254.43 are at least on par with and in
fact, more often, more dramatic
7260.43 in response to allogrooming
than in response
7262.92 to other forms of touch.
7264.7 So the point here
is that allogrooming
7267.69 is a prosocial
behavior that tends
7270.24 to associate with
and promote feelings
7273.3 of well-being and happiness.
7275.28 And this is not
a trivial effect.
7277.15 If you look at the brain imaging
data or other forms of data
7280.17 on this, allogrooming
is a very powerful form
7283.17 of bonding between individuals
that's completely nonverbal.
7286.59 In fact, most often it
doesn't involve eye contact.
7288.833 I suppose two people could
be looking at one another
7291.0 grooming one another,
but typically, this
7292.8 is done from the
side or from behind.
7296.01 Why did I bring up
the paper on pets?
7298.83 Well it turns out that
when humans stroke dogs,
7303.15 or brush their
dogs or stroke cats
7305.61 or brush their cats,
et cetera, that
7308.49 is a form of human to
animal allogrooming.
7310.8 And it's one in which
both the pet and the human
7315.67 receive huge
increases in oxytocin
7318.79 and other related neurochemicals
that make us feel bonded.
7321.91 I bring this up because
the Harvard longitudinal
7324.49 study on happiness,
and many, many others,
7326.92 if not hundreds of other
studies on happiness,
7329.11 point to the importance of
quality social connection.
7332.163 You hear this over
and over again.
7333.58 People on their
deathbeds don't say
7335.11 they wish they had worked more.
7336.49 People on their deathbeds
talk about the richness
7339.07 of social connections
or the wish
7340.75 that they had invested
more in social connections.
7343.27 I think a lot of people
think of social connections
7345.61 only in terms of travel with
or conversation with others.
7350.68 But much of what we perceive
as deep social connections
7355.09 also involves physical contact.
7358.06 And that's something
that's deeply rooted
7360.52 in our evolutionary biology.
7361.99 And it's present both in us
and in non-human primates.
7364.69 And it's clear
that we can engage
7368.2 in these kinds of pro-social,
non verbal, non eye contact
7372.49 type behaviors through things
like non-sexual tactile
7376.15 touch, a.k.a.
7377.5 allogrooming.
7378.22 So we've been talking about a
number of the different things
7380.72 that one can do in order to
increase levels of happiness.
7383.53 And certainly,
before we conclude
7385.48 today, I'm going to
touch back into not just
7388.27 synthetic happiness and the
various things we can do,
7390.74 such as prosocial
spending, allogrooming,
7393.64 social connection, et cetera.
7396.25 But also things
related to happiness
7399.04 that involve focus on vocation
and work and pursuit of goals.
7404.65 Because as I mentioned
at the beginning,
7406.45 those are also
critical to increasing
7409.348 our state of happiness,
and certainly
7410.89 our state of security
and the feeling
7412.69 that we can provide for
ourselves and perhaps
7414.79 for others, as well.
7415.94 So we will talk about that.
7418.01 But I think it's also
important to talk
7420.37 about this notion of
choice and choices,
7423.46 and whether or not having
a lot of freedom to choose
7426.73 or limited freedom in choosing
what we do and what we get,
7430.9 and what we are able
to pursue in life,
7433.16 how that relates to
both natural happiness
7436.42 and synthetic happiness.
7438.13 Dan Gilbert and
others have explored
7440.71 this issue of freedom
of choice and how
7443.14 it relates to happiness.
7444.98 And there I must
say, the findings
7447.52 are incredibly counterintuitive.
7450.7 But very, very well supported
by all of their data.
7455.21 I'm going to summarize a large
amount of those studies at once
7458.72 by saying the following.
7460.64 Dan's laboratory and
other laboratories
7462.557 have done experiments
where they give people
7464.39 a series of options.
7466.08 And one of the more
classic examples, they
7468.2 give people the opportunity
to rate a number
7470.54 of different
paintings or pictures
7472.49 in ascending or descending
order of preference.
7476.427 In other words,
they're deciding which
7478.01 ones they like most which
ones they like least.
7480.68 Then what's interesting
is the experimenter
7483.44 will vary the
extent to which they
7485.36 have to stick to that choice.
7487.08 So this could be
sticking to the choice
7488.81 by receiving that
painting to take home.
7491.15 Or in another
experiment, it was having
7493.79 to make a choice
between giving up
7495.38 one photograph that they,
the research subject took,
7498.8 or another photograph
that they took.
7500.48 One of the photographs
was going to go off
7502.31 to a publication, another one
they could keep for themselves.
7505.25 And the conditions
in that experiment
7507.59 were either that you
had to make the decision
7510.93 and it was final, that is,
you could keep one and rate
7513.98 your decision, or
you could keep one
7516.47 and then you had the
opportunity to swap out
7518.87 that picture for the other
one at some later time.
7521.34 In other words, these
experiments really
7523.46 weren't about rating pictures,
they were really about
7525.92 whether or not constraining
your choice, meaning
7529.76 forcing somebody
to make a choice
7531.5 and stick to that choice, led
to greater levels or lesser
7534.83 levels of happiness and
satisfaction with that choice.
7538.04 And what they find
consistently is
7541.01 that when people have an
ongoing set of choices
7545.84 it leads to reduced
levels of happiness.
7548.418 Now that might come as
surprising to many of you,
7550.46 but I want to be clear
about what this means.
7552.41 This is not to say that having a
lot of choices of what you like
7556.46 most leads to lesser happiness.
7559.79 And that having fewer
choices about things
7562.85 you do, or objects you
acquire, et cetera,
7566.27 leads to greater happiness.
7568.91 What this set of
experiments really points to
7571.82 is that when we make a
choice, if we are forced
7575.51 to stick to that
choice we tend to be
7578.06 far happier with that
choice than if we maintain
7581.06 the option to change our mind.
7583.71 The results of these experiments
are extremely informative,
7586.43 I believe, in terms of
understanding our real life
7590.13 happiness.
7590.63 That is, happiness
outside the laboratory.
7593.24 But I think they are
often misunderstood
7595.55 as meaning that if we
have a lot of choices
7597.59 we tend to be less happy than
if we have fewer choices.
7600.26 That is not the case.
7601.34 Having freedom of
choice is terrific.
7604.31 And actually, correlates with
elevated levels of happiness.
7607.94 But once we make
our choice, it's
7610.91 clearly the case that
killing all other choices
7613.91 or having all other
options killed
7615.74 for us increases our
satisfaction with the choice
7619.01 that we've made.
7619.97 Whereas, leaving doors open,
leaving options open greatly
7623.96 diminishes our sense
of satisfaction.
7627.11 This has been exported to any
number of different domains.
7630.57 So this has been exported to
the domain of making choices
7634.43 about what college to go to or
what partner to select in life.
7639.8 In every one of
those instances, we
7641.99 see that our happiness
with our choice
7643.76 is very much related
to that choice
7645.68 being either the only one or
one of very few other options.
7650.558 There are a number of different
ways to interpret this.
7652.85 Through the lens
of neuroscience we
7654.92 might say that the
prefrontal cortex,
7658.4 the area of the brain that's
involved in decision making
7661.85 and evaluating
different options,
7664.7 is an area of the brain
that's vital, frankly,
7668.42 to our evolution as human
beings and to our daily life
7671.24 and to our whole life.
7672.915 It is, of course,
the thing that allows
7674.54 us to evaluate different rule
sets, to change rule sets,
7677.78 to switch contexts and to
create meaning, et cetera.
7680.78 To interpret what's
good what's bad.
7682.73 But it's also a
fairly costly process,
7684.99 meaning it's very
metabolically demanding.
7686.9 And there's an entire
literature related
7689.3 to what's called ego depletion.
7690.83 This is certainly a topic
for a future podcast.
7692.99 But ego depletion essentially
says that if I have you
7695.51 attend very intensely to a
given task, for instance,
7701.22 asking you to count
backwards from 1,000 to 0
7703.58 in increments of 13.
7705.47 And then have you
switch about halfway
7708.23 through, that's hard
for a lot of people.
7710.51 If I have you do that,
then your ability
7712.58 to suppress impulsive behavior
and to do a hard cognitive
7717.68 or physical task immediately
after that is actually
7720.41 suppressed.
7720.92 This so-called ego depletion.
7722.09 It relates to a number
of different things,
7723.882 but it certainly
relates to engagement
7726.77 of the prefrontal
cortex, which is
7728.24 very metabolically demanding.
7729.83 So evaluating choices and
doing computation of numbers
7733.91 or attending to
things with your mind
7736.16 and forcing yourself
to focus intensely
7738.2 is metabolically demanding.
7740.36 And that's a limited
resource that
7742.28 can be reset by things like
sleep and non sleep deep rest
7745.01 or idle time or letting
your mind wander.
7746.9 In that case a
positive mind wandering
7748.73 to allow your brain to
reset its ability to focus.
7751.92 But the other thing
that it does is
7755.25 it impacts the reward
circuitry of the brain,
7758.52 the so-called dopamine reward
circuitry and other reward
7760.98 circuitry of the brain.
7763.262 And here I'm painting
with a broad brush.
7764.97 But it essentially divides
them such that for instance,
7769.06 if a given choice of
a let's say a partner
7772.26 or maybe buying ourselves
an article of clothing,
7774.9 not that I want to compare
selection of a life partner
7777.535 to selection of an
article of clothing.
7779.16 But just to give
multiple examples.
7780.81 Might give us, and here
it's arbitrary units, x
7784.98 units of dopamine increase.
7787.95 Well, if we buy that
article of clothing or we
7790.47 select that life
partner, and then
7792.3 we emerge from the
store or the wedding
7795.24 and we are focused on what
we purchased for ourselves,
7798.97 our choice, or our life partner
choice, and only that, well
7803.61 then there's a certain amount of
neurochemical reward associated
7807.37 with that.
7807.87 And happiness and well-being.
7809.46 But it's also very
clear that if we
7813.97 leave those choices, the store
or our wedding for instance,
7818.3 or a life with somebody for
a moment, even just mentally,
7820.96 and start thinking
about the other options
7823.15 that we might
entertain as possible.
7825.67 If those are still open to
us in reality or in our mind,
7828.79 well then our reward circuitry
becomes fractured in a way.
7832.63 Not physically fractured,
but less attention
7835.42 is devoted to the reward
circuitry associated
7838.42 with our choice.
7840.1 And as a consequence, instead
of it being x units of dopamine,
7843.82 it's x divided by however
many other choices
7848.32 we might have available to
us in our mind or in reality.
7851.5 So instead of, and again,
these are arbitrary units,
7853.84 but instead of a certain
amount of reward,
7855.905 it's a certain amount
of reward divided
7857.53 by the number of
other options that we
7859.48 might be considering as
alternatives to what we chose.
7863.99 And I think this is a
very important aspect
7866.95 of understanding how limiting
our choices after we've
7871.51 made them is a
vital part of what
7874.69 we call synthetic happiness.
7876.32 In fact, we could
even go so far as
7878.08 to say that focusing on
the choices we've made
7880.72 and really investing in
those choices as good ones,
7884.47 or great ones, and
really trying to limit
7886.847 our thinking to the
choices that we've
7888.43 made once we've
made them is perhaps
7891.49 also important to our
natural happiness.
7894.34 Because it's so inextricably
entwined with what
7898.81 we think of as a good life.
7901.07 And what I mean by that
is if we are constantly
7904.15 in a mode of evaluative
decision making,
7906.35 even after we've
made a decision,
7908.08 we are not neurochemically
nor psychologically able
7912.07 to extract the feelings
of happiness associated
7914.762 with the choice that we made.
7915.97 So we've talked about a
number of different dimensions
7917.68 of happiness, both in synthetic
and natural happiness.
7920.23 And some of the more
counterintuitive aspects
7922.9 of happiness.
7924.49 For instance, that
people tend to adjust
7926.47 their levels of happiness not
regardless but often in spite
7931.62 of their life circumstances.
7933.7 But as we emphasized earlier
in the episode, that is not
7937.14 to say, at least the
research does not directly
7940.02 support the idea that
a major trauma or loss
7943.71 won't impact our happiness.
7945.34 In fact, it tends to.
7946.95 And that's why it's
important that people access
7949.32 resources and work devoted
to overcoming trauma, which
7951.99 certainly exists out there.
7954.43 And of course, there are
the longitudinal studies
7957.54 in short term studies showing
that income level and material
7961.65 things don't necessarily scale
with happiness, and vise versa.
7966.03 And yet, we also acknowledged
early in the episode
7969.24 that while indeed money
can't buy happiness,
7971.76 it can buffer stress.
7973.11 And while work doesn't
necessarily bring happiness,
7976.47 per se, work can bring
a tremendous feeling
7980.19 of meaning and resources
which can then put you
7983.4 into context in which things
like prosocial contact
7987.03 and enhanced bonds and
caretaking of others and of you
7992.16 can be enhanced.
7993.21 So it would be unfair
and in fact, inaccurate,
7996.39 to simply view happiness
through the lens of money
7999.45 doesn't matter, it's all
about social connection.
8001.98 And so on and so forth.
8003.89 Absolutely, social
connection is important,
8006.6 which is why we spent some
minutes talking about some
8009.093 of the ways to enhance
social connection
8010.76 both with other human
beings and other animals,
8013.01 and them with us.
8015.68 I think there's a opportunity
here to take the research
8019.28 on happiness, the research
on the neuroscience of what
8023.15 happiness and gratitude and
prosocial connection tells us,
8027.44 and to combine it into a
bit of a model or a toolkit,
8030.87 if you will.
8031.47 And I think indeed, this
will be a toolkit in one
8033.86 of our future toolkit episodes,
likely merged with the toolkit
8036.65 on gratitude, which
we haven't done yet.
8039.45 And perhaps even we will do an
entire episode on social bonds
8044.39 and how to enhance or
build social bonds.
8046.79 Or at least what the
science tells us about that.
8050.413 If we take a step
back and we look
8051.83 at the concept of happiness,
we can make a couple
8055.25 of absolute statements.
8057.05 That is, statements that I
think very few people, if any,
8059.49 would contest.
8060.11 First of all, there's no
single molecule or chemical
8062.69 associated with happiness,
but that the chemical milieu
8065.33 of the brain and body
is important for setting
8069.65 the stage or the
opportunity for happiness.
8073.47 Hence, why there are treatments
aimed at alleviating depression
8077.16 or mania that target certain
neurochemical systems
8080.28 and hormone systems.
8081.99 Happiness, at least the
way I'm framing it today,
8085.38 has essentially two components.
8086.83 One is meaning.
8089.19 That is, what sort of meaning
do certain types of interactions
8094.47 or behaviors, could be work,
could be social interactions,
8098.31 et cetera, carry for us?
8101.28 And nested in that is this
concept of connection.
8104.035 And we talked a bit about
tools for enhancing connection.
8106.41 Things like eye contact, but
not constant eye contact.
8108.93 Things like being very
present to a conversation
8112.5 or an activity that
you're engaging in.
8115.05 Remember, we talked
about the paper,
8116.85 "A Distracted Mind
is an Unhappy Mind"?
8119.218 The paper published in Science.
8120.51 And we talked about the study,
also published in Science
8122.843 in which giving money, but
also knowing how that money has
8128.38 positively impacted
others, leads
8130.57 to this feeling of pro-social
connection and happiness
8133.09 in the giver and
in the receiver.
8135.43 And I should mention
again that it's not
8137.68 just the giving of money but
also the giving of effort
8140.56 and time and attention that
can have similar effects.
8144.17 So we have meaning
and connection,
8145.84 and a number of different
ways to access those.
8148.31 And then we have
this access that I'm
8150.64 referring to as
performance and resources.
8152.99 And I'm talking about
performance and resources
8156.13 as it relates to
natural happiness, not
8159.708 synthetic happiness,
but natural happiness.
8161.5 Because we would be
wrong, I believe,
8165.34 if we were to say that
income doesn't matter.
8168.25 I think it's fair to say,
based on the research,
8171.19 that income matters.
8173.29 And income that can cover
costs of living plus that
8176.62 includes some buffer.
8178.702 And what do I mean by buffer?
8179.91 I mean buffer to the anxiety
that circumstances might change
8183.87 is important.
8184.95 Now that's going to vary
from person to person.
8188.52 Meaning some people
will be perfectly happy
8191.19 making $1 more than their
absolute cost of living
8197.61 every month.
8198.9 Other people will require
a more substantial buffer
8201.809 in order to protect them against
the negative psychological
8205.889 effects of worrying about
for instance, inflation.
8208.448 Or worrying that they
might lose their job.
8210.24 And this is why I think
most people recommend
8212.459 having, if possible, some
buffer in their bank account
8216.209 that could cover two or
three or maybe even six
8219.92 or maybe even 12 months
of living expenses
8222.65 were they to lose
their job or something
8224.389 catastrophic happened to them.
8226.32 So if we're going to
talk about happiness,
8228.95 I think it's only fair, only
accurate, and frankly, only
8232.309 respectful to talk about
living requirements and cost
8237.44 of living requirements.
8238.459 That includes this
sort of buffer.
8240.35 And that buffer to
anxiety is going
8242.18 to vary depending on how
anxious somebody gets
8245.03 about the possibility
of catastrophic things
8247.309 happening to them, like
losing their job or their rent
8249.559 going up or doubling.
8250.57 And here, I'm talking
about hypotheticals.
8252.32 But I think we all know
people and perhaps ourselves
8254.9 have experienced those
kinds of circumstances.
8257.459 So when we talk about
happiness we absolutely
8259.76 need to think about resources.
8261.23 And we also need to
think about performance.
8263.209 I think we would be completely
inaccurate if we simply
8266.78 said, oh, any work
leading to any outcomes.
8271.219 Any effort, regardless
of whether or not
8273.379 it gets you an A in
school or an F in school
8276.02 isn't going to impact
your happiness.
8278.42 I don't think anyone
would agree with that.
8280.709 And yet if you look at
the major takeaways,
8282.95 at least as they are
communicated typically
8286.459 in the public sphere around
the longitudinal and short term
8290.809 studies of happiness,
the takeaway generally
8294.02 is more focused on
social connection
8297.53 and how money is not important.
8299.299 I don't think anyone that's
saying that actually means
8302.42 that income that can cover
your expenses plus some buffer
8306.86 isn't important.
8307.58 But it's often not stated.
8309.27 So if we were to come up with a
general model of happiness that
8312.02 includes various tools
for how to increase
8314.57 our levels of happiness,
I think it's only
8316.79 fair to include both natural
and synthetic forms of happiness
8320.389 and to pursue both natural
and synthetic happiness.
8323.9 Just to remind you,
natural happiness
8326.059 is the kind of happiness
that we associate
8328.37 with obtaining something,
either by effort
8330.98 or because it was given to us.
8332.33 Although, I definitely want
to highlight the fact that
8334.85 receiving things that don't
require much reward in order
8339.889 to receive them over
time can be detrimental
8342.44 to our dopamine system.
8343.639 That's an important aside.
8344.959 The other form of happiness
is the form of happiness
8348.29 that we call
synthetic happiness.
8350.03 Which is, for instance,
focusing on social connection.
8353.57 And we talked about ways
to do that as a means
8356.27 to enhance your happiness.
8357.77 Again, the language, the
name synthetic happiness
8360.998 implies something
kind of artificial.
8362.54 But frankly, genuine social
connection is genuine.
8365.942 There's nothing
artificial about it
8367.4 or synthetic about it, is
that you can synthesize it
8369.74 through action, through
deliberate action.
8371.99 Likewise, being focused
or encouraging yourself.
8376.4 Working on being focused on
whatever activities you happen
8379.129 to be engaged in,
positive or negative,
8381.26 is known to increase
your levels of happiness.
8383.629 Again, this is a form
of synthetic happiness.
8386.24 You're not obtaining
anything new or additional
8389.48 as a consequence of this.
8390.71 It's entirely internal.
8392.93 There's no external reward.
8394.4 There isn't more
money that arrives
8396.26 with this or a better grade.
8397.82 Although, I would
make the argument
8399.41 that if you are
present to the work
8401.36 you're doing in any context,
physical or mental work,
8405.14 it's very likely
that you are going
8406.97 to perform better at that work.
8408.71 So we have natural happiness
and synthetic happiness.
8411.62 And both of them require
our attention and effort.
8415.1 And in fact, if we
were to draw a link
8418.49 between natural and
synthetic happiness,
8420.74 it really is this
concept of presence,
8422.81 of really being focused
on what we're doing,
8424.91 that's most likely to lead
to the outcomes that we want.
8428.6 Both externally, in terms of
receiving monetary rewards
8431.84 or grades, or
praise, or whatever
8433.662 it is that you happen to
be pursuing out there,
8435.62 resources of some kind.
8437.18 And presence, and
striving to be present
8441.02 when in the pursuit of so-called
synthetic happiness in the form
8444.68 of social connection or in
the form of really focusing
8448.492 on the choice that
you've made and making
8450.2 the best of that choice,
especially since you
8452.3 made that choice in a way that
you deemed best at the time.
8456.53 Well, that also is known to
increase your overall levels
8460.4 of happiness.
8461.28 So if an ability to focus
and attend to things deeply
8464.3 is really what's most important,
and really acts as the greatest
8468.29 lever for both natural
and synthetic happiness,
8470.75 well then, tools like a 5 minute
daily meditation or a 13 minute
8474.86 day meditation, as
well as tools that
8478.07 allow us to get excellent
sleep every night.
8480.98 Which, of course, sets the basis
for attention during the day.
8484.247 If you've ever had a
poor night's sleep then
8486.08 you are very familiar
with how hard it
8488.48 is to focus the following day.
8491.09 At least for long
periods of time.
8493.11 But building our
capacity to focus
8495.5 through a focusing exercise,
which again, is often
8498.14 called meditation, but
is really simply just
8500.39 a focusing and
perceptual exercise.
8503.15 That's going to create
an outsized effect
8505.37 on all the aspects,
all the behaviors
8507.92 that we know feed into
creating natural and synthetic
8510.59 happiness.
8511.43 And so it's really fair
to say that our ability
8513.8 to attend and focus really
equates to happiness.
8517.78 So as is often typical
of this podcast,
8519.81 today we've talked a lot
about the various aspects
8522.403 of the science of happiness,
including the different forms
8524.82 of happiness and tools to
access those different forms
8527.79 of happiness.
