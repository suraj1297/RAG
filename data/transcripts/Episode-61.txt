0.35 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
1.92 where we discuss science
and science based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
6.318 [mellow music]
9.15 I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm
a Professor of Neurobiology
11.68 and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.
14.122 Today we're talking all about habits.
16.425 In particular,
17.381 we're going to discuss the
biology of habit formation
20.902 and the biology of how we break habits.
24.16 I think we can all appreciate
the value of having habits.
27.931 Habits organize our behavior
29.92 into more or less reflexive actions
31.88 so we don't have to think too much
33.54 about performing the various
behaviors that, for instance,
37.16 allow us to brush our teeth
38.419 or which side of bed we
roll out of in the morning.
41.459 And then of course, habits
can be more elaborate too.
44.5 We can be in the habit of exercising
46.1 at a particular time of day.
47.55 We can be in the habit
of eating certain foods.
49.23 We can be in the habit of
saying or saying certain things.
52.032 But of course,
53.054 there are many habits
that don't serve us well,
55.92 or that perhaps even
undermine our immediate
58.5 and long term health goals
and psychological goals.
61.479 And even some habits
62.373 that can really undermine
our overall life goals.
65.5 So today we're going to talk
about making, meaning forming,
68.62 and breaking, meaning
stopping, various habits.
71.061 There's a lot of information
out there about habits.
74.76 You'll find this in the popular sphere.
76.27 There are books, there are
articles, there are workshops,
78.57 and so forth.
79.84 However, lesser known is that
there's a whole neuroscience
82.85 of habit formation and habit breaking.
84.84 And there's a whole field
of psychology devoted
86.94 to understanding habit
formation and habit breaking.
90.17 And within those scientific literatures,
92.41 I think there are some real gems that,
94.36 at least to my knowledge,
95.43 we haven't paid too much attention to
97.03 in the popular sphere.
98.55 So today,
99.383 we're going to talk about the
biology of habit formation
101.2 and habit breaking.
107.88 I'm going to boil these down
to some very explicit steps
111.25 that anyone can use.
113.3 My reasoning for doing
that is, first of all,
115.58 it's the end of 2021.
117.65 Many people are thinking
about new year's resolutions.
119.69 They're thinking about leaving
some things behind from 2021
123.95 and previous.
125.17 And acquiring some new behaviors,
127.274 taking on some new challenges,
128.93 and trying to bring new
things to their lives.
130.71 But regardless of when
you're listening to this,
132.494 the programs that I'll outline
134.79 are grounded in the neuroscience
136.25 and biology of habit formation.
138.15 And they map very well
139.31 to what the psychologists have described,
141.1 in terms of habit formation and breaking.
143.12 So today you're going to
learn a lot of science,
144.57 you're also going to come
away with some practical tools
146.326 and I'm certain that regardless
of your present state
148.81 or goals, there'll be
something of value to you.
151.5 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
153.09 that this podcast is
separate from my teaching
154.85 and research roles at Stanford.
156.56 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
158.38 to bring zero cost to consumer information
160.21 about science and science related tools
162.11 to the general public.
163.39 In keeping with that theme,
164.28 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
166.423 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
168.712 Athletic greens is in all-in-one vitamin,
170.92 mineral, probiotic drink.
172.67 I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012,
175.17 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
177.67 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens
179.23 and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens is
181.52 that because of the
ingredients it contains,
183.58 I know that I'm covering
all of my foundation needs
185.84 for vitamins, minerals, and probiotics.
188.23 There is a wealth of knowledge
now pointing to the fact
190.92 that the so-called
gut-brain axis is important
193.167 for our brain health,
for our metabolic health,
196.28 for our hormone health,
for our immune system,
198.52 so the probiotics, vitamins,
199.83 and minerals really support that system.
201.75 And many of the other things it contains
204.02 generally support our health,
205.77 in terms of neural
system, meaning the brain,
207.96 the spinal cord, et cetera.
209.221 Basically, Athletic Greens
has all the things I need,
212.13 nothing I don't, and by
taking it once or twice a day,
215.29 I always feel better
216.25 and I know that I'm covering all my bases.
218.594 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
220.31 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
223.22 to claim a special offer.
224.35 They'll give you five free travel packs
225.93 that make it very easy
to mix up Athletic Greens
227.73 while you're on the road, in the car,
229.13 or on the plane, et cetera.
230.46 Plus, a year's supply of vitamin D3, K2.
233.1 Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
235.89 to claim this special offer
of the five free travel packs
238.37 plus a year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2.
241.39 Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
244.11 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
247.09 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
249.216 to help you better understand your body
251.25 and help you reach your health goals.
252.9 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood-work done
255.628 for the simple reason
that most of the factors
258.68 that impact your immediate
and long-term health
260.74 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
263.15 And nowadays, with the
advent of modern DNA tests,
265.55 you can also get insight
into your particular needs
268.3 for your genetic type.
270.566 Now, a major issue with
a lot of blood tests
273.29 and DNA tests out there is
you get the numbers back,
275.38 you get a lot of information back,
276.56 but you don't know what to
do with that information.
278.226 InsideTracker makes that very easy.
280.37 They have a personalized platform
282.087 where you get your numbers
283.88 and it points to specific
things that you can do,
285.77 in terms of behavioral protocols,
287.35 meaning things you perhaps
should do more of or less of,
289.764 nutritional protocols,
291.67 things that you perhaps should
ingest more of or less of,
294.126 and various things that you might consider
296.41 for more elaborate, directed approaches
298.65 to adjusting the numbers in
your blood and DNA profiles.
301.695 Another feature of InsideTracker,
302.723 is that it has what's
called "The Inner Age Test".
305.52 This test allows you to see
what your biological age is
307.8 and compare that to
your chronological age.
309.83 Of course,
310.663 your biological age is the
one that you can control
312.82 and that's the one that's really important
314.29 to your immediate and long-term health.
316.16 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
317.56 you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
320.46 to get 25% off any of
InsideTracker's plans.
323.53 That's insidetracker.com/huberman

327.62 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.
330.13 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
332.7 that I truly believe
are the best out there.
335.696 I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress
337.95 for about a year now
339.07 and it's the best sleep I've ever had.
340.476 One thing that makes Helix
mattresses really unique
343.193 is that they are tailored
to your unique sleep needs.
346.49 You can go to their
website, you take a quiz,
348.24 it only takes about two minutes,
349.72 and it will match your body
type and sleep preferences
352.67 to a particular mattress.
354.09 So, it will ask you questions such as,
355.167 "Do you sleep on your side,
you back, or your stomach?"
357.987 "Do you tend to run hot
or cold during the night?"
359.7 Maybe you don't know.
360.718 You answer those questions
and it matches you
362.95 to the mattress that's right for you.
364.64 For me, that turned out to be
the Dusk Mattress, D U S K.
367.61 I wanted a mattress that
wasn't too firm, not too soft.
369.98 Anyway, I matched to the Dusk.
371.55 I've been sleeping on a Dusk Mattress,
372.98 as I mentioned before.
374.45 It's been the best experience for me.
376.05 My sleep is so improved.
377.563 So if you're interested
in upgrading your mattress
379.61 go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
381.88 take their two-minute sleep quiz,
383.16 and they'll match you to a
customized mattress for you.
385.47 And you'll get up to $200
off all mattress orders
388.33 and two free pillows.
389.74 Again, go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
392.28 take their quiz, match to the
mattress that's right for you,
394.613 and if you decide to purchase it,
396.15 you'll get up to $200
off all mattress orders
398.97 and two free pillows.
400.19 They have a ten-year warrantee
401.62 and if you want to try
it out, you can do that
403.66 for 100 nights risk-free.
405.08 They'll even pick the mattress up for you
406.34 if you don't love it,
407.173 but I'm pretty confident that you will.
409.24 Again, helixsleep.com/huberman
411.728 is where you'll find the
Helix mattress for you.
414.14 Let's talk about habits.
415.82 And anytime we're talking about habits,
417.65 that means our nervous
system learns something.
420.653 Now, many people think that
habits are just like reflexes,
424.196 but pure reflexes are things
like the eye blink reflex.
428.27 You know, something comes towards your eye
429.65 and you don't want it to get
in your eye, you'll blink.
431.787 Or if you happen to
step on a sharp object,
434.607 or get too close to
something that's too hot,
437.17 you'll reflexively move away.
438.91 Those aren't habits.
439.85 Those are what we call
hard-wired reflexes.
442.442 Habits are things that our
nervous system learned,
445.995 but not always consciously.
447.94 Sometimes we develop habits
that we're not even aware of
450.178 until they become a problem
452.39 or maybe they serve us well.
454.09 Who knows?
455.0 But the fact of the matter is
456.019 that habits are a big part of who we are.
458.359 What we do habitually makes up
much of what we do entirely.
463.43 In fact, it's estimated
464.263 that up to 70% of our
waking behavior is made up
467.796 of habitual behavior.
470.023 So, you can imagine that
there's a lot of biology,
473.308 meaning cells and hormones and
neural pathways, et cetera,
476.52 that are going to support
development of those habits.
479.74 So if habits are largely, learned,
481.43 consciously or unconsciously,
483.532 we have to ask ourselves,
485.23 what is learning?
486.26 Well, learning is neuroplasticity.
488.91 Neuroplasticity is simply the process
491.41 by which our nervous system changes
493.28 in response to experience.
494.861 We have to ask, what changes?
496.97 Well, what changes are the
connections between neurons.
499.87 Neurons are just nerve cells.
501.26 They communicate with one
another by electricity
503.7 and by sending chemical
signals to one another
506.1 that inspire the next
neuron and the next neuron
508.65 to either electrically active or not.
510.797 But at the end of the day,
512.26 neuroplasticity is about
forming new neural circuits,
515.46 new pathways by which certain
habits are likely to occur,
518.66 and other ones are less likely to occur.
520.572 So, we've got habits.
521.862 We have that habits are learned,
524.11 we have that learning
involves neuroplasticity,
526.66 and that neuroplasticity involves changes
528.65 in the connections between
neurons, nerve cells.
531.17 Okay, so that describes
habits through the lens
533.81 of neuroscience and biology,
535.94 but as many of you are well aware,
537.737 there are popular books about habits
539.807 and there's a whole psychological
literature about habits,
542.208 and those two areas point
545.61 to some very interesting aspects of habits
547.55 that I think are worth mentioning.
549.15 First of all is this notion
of immediate goal-based habits
553.62 versus identity-based habits.
555.927 Immediate goal-based habits
are going to be habits
558.72 that are designed to bring
you a specific outcome
561.223 as you do them,
562.85 so each and every time you do them.
564.6 So for instance,
565.433 it might be that you want to
develop a habit of getting,
568.047 you know, 60 minutes of
zone II cardio each day,
572.326 or perhaps 3-4 times per week,
as we head into the new year.
576.91 I've talked before on the
podcast about the fact
579.24 that the scientific literature
580.307 and the health literature really points
581.88 to the incredibly positive effects
584.22 of getting 150 minutes to
180 minutes per week minimum
588.096 of what's called zone II cardio.
590.29 Zone II cardio is basically
any cardiovascular exercise
593.476 that gets you moving,
and your heart pumping,
596.23 and breathing,
597.582 but not so hard that you
can't hold a conversation,
599.21 and so that kind of puts
you at the threshold
602.072 of just being just able
to have a conversation
602.905 that's a little bit strained,
603.99 but if you were to exercise
a little bit harder,
605.99 you know, run a little
bit faster, et cetera,
608.13 you wouldn't be able to
talk while you did it.
609.987 There's a lot of literature
that points to that
612.19 as a healthy practice.
613.7 So maybe you're somebody that wants
615.24 to get more of zone II
cardio, for instance.
618.047 That would be an
immediate goal-based habit
621.476 if your goal is to get that cardio,
625.13 maybe 4 times a week.
627.29 Every time you do it you
check off a little box
629.25 and you say, "Okay, I did
it." You met the goal.
632.54 That is different than
so-called identity-based habits
636.1 where there's a larger,
over-arching theme to the habit,
639.58 where you're trying to
become, quote unquote,
641.777 "a fit person".
642.8 Or you're somebody who
wants to be an athlete
646.19 or something of that sort.
647.18 It's where you start to attach
some sort of larger picture
649.78 about yourself or what it
means for you to do that habit
653.33 where there's both the
immediate goal, right?
656.32 Complete the exercise,
complete the session,
658.99 or whatever it is, check off that box.
661.258 But that you're linking it
to some sort of larger goal.
663.91 Now, why am I making this distinction?
665.38 I mean, first of all,
666.32 I'm not the one to first
make this distinction.
668.2 Others have made the
distinction between identity
670.067 versus immediate
goal-based habit formation.
672.541 But the reason I'm
making the distinction is
674.35 that pretty soon in our discussion today
676.007 we are going to talk about dopamine,
678.47 a molecule that's associated
with motivation and reward,
682.27 that we make in our brain,
684.029 and how different schedules
of dopamine release
687.764 predict where we will
stick to a habit or not.
691.513 And in particular,
692.61 whether or not we will be able
to form that habit quickly
695.082 or not.
695.915 Now, this is absolutely
critical to understand
699.34 for the following reason.
700.81 Another thing that you'll hear
out there in the literature
702.96 is that it takes 21 days to form a habit.
705.28 Some people say 18, some people say 21,
707.64 some people say 30 days,
some people say 60 days.
710.094 So which one is it?
711.31 Does it depend on the habit
that one is trying to form?
713.51 Or does it depend on the person
714.67 that's trying to form the habit?
716.4 Well, it turns out
717.233 that there's excellent
peer-reviewed data on this.
719.63 There's a study published in 2010,
721.02 first author Lally, L A L L Y.
723.436 This study found that,
724.87 for the same habit to be formed,
727.441 it can take anywhere from 18 days
730.74 to as many as 254 days
for different individuals
734.62 to form that habit.
735.62 The reason I bring this up,
is that I always get asked,
738.307 "Is it true that it takes
21 days to form a habit?"
740.947 "Is it true that your nervous
system changes in six days"
743.527 "when you're doing something repeatedly?"
745.64 And the answer is, as I mentioned before,
748.01 it's highly variable.
749.46 What I didn't tell you actually,
750.73 is what specific habit
they were looking at
752.47 in that Lally study.
754.04 And it's interesting that
the specific behavior
756.55 was a health-related behavior.
758.7 That's pretty relevant
to our discussion here,
760.36 on the podcast.
761.34 Which was taking walks after dinner.
763.78 There's actually a really nice literature
766.0 showing that walks after a meal
768.37 can speed glucose clearance
from the blood stream,
771.31 can be beneficial for
not just weight loss,
773.41 but cardiovascular health, et cetera.
775.64 So a walk after dinner seems
pretty straight-forward, right?
778.26 Well, in order to form that habit,
780.141 it took some people 18 days
and other people 254 days.
785.1 How did they know when
they formed the habit?
786.44 Well, they were doing
it about 85% of the time
789.415 and they also reported not having to spend
792.41 that much mental effort in
order to get into to the mode
796.43 of taking a walk after dinner.
797.95 So, for those of you listening,
799.03 some of you might be thinking,
799.937 "I can't believe that it would
take certain people 254 days"
802.667 "to get into that habit."
804.21 As I said, people are highly variable
806.266 and if you can't form one habit easily,
809.13 it doesn't mean that you can't
form other habits easily.
811.538 The mystery of why certain people
814.67 can form certain habits
more easily than others?
817.36 Probably has something to
do with how people manage
820.73 what's called limbic friction.
822.39 Now, limbic friction is not a
term that you're going to find
824.972 in the formal neurobiological literature
827.72 or even some of the
psychological literature.
829.49 It's, frankly, a term that I coined
831.486 to encompass a number of different pieces
834.9 of the psychology and
neuroscience literature.
837.48 Limbic friction is a short-hand way
839.73 that I use to describe
the strain that's required
843.12 in order to overcome one of
two states within your body.
847.0 One state is one of anxiousness,
848.91 where you're really anxious
849.93 and therefore you can't
calm down, you can't relax,
853.51 and therefore you can't engage
in some particular activity
856.0 or thought pattern that you would like.
857.83 The other state is one in
which you're feeling too tired
860.21 or lazy or not motivated.
862.67 Both of those states, feeling too alert
865.14 and too calm, if you will,
866.8 relate to the function
867.66 of the so-called autonomic nervous system,
869.69 a set of neurons and hormones
and chemicals in your brain
872.75 and body that act as sort of a see-saw.
874.69 You're either alert or calm.
876.17 You're either asleep or stressed.
878.25 Those two states are not
compatible with one another.
881.3 You've probably heard of "wired and tired"
882.99 but that's really once
you've been very stressed
885.04 for a long time, to the
point where you're exhausted.
887.55 What does the autonomic
nervous system have to do
889.22 with any of this?
890.053 Well, limbic friction is a phrase
893.095 that can be used to
describe how much effort,
895.84 how much activation energy you need
898.51 in order to engage in
a particular behavior.
900.69 So, using this Lally study as an example,
903.3 some people would eat
dinner, and then say,
905.367 "Oh, that's right, I've been
trying to develop the habit"
907.367 "of taking a walk after dinner."
908.977 "So, let's get up and go."
910.47 Other people will feel like,
911.303 "I just don't want to do it today."
912.67 They're going to feel
too much limbic friction
914.64 and that limbic friction
could arrive, again,
916.75 from one of two sources.
918.11 It could be because they
are too tired to do it
920.55 or it could be because they're too anxious
922.69 and distracted in order to do it.
925.0 So, this is a key distinction.
927.19 A lot of habit formation has to do
929.08 with being in the right state of mind
930.96 and being able to control
your state of body and mind.
934.42 So as we march forward,
935.44 what you're going to
find is that this phrase
937.325 or this term, limbic friction,
939.0 is going to be a useful metric
940.62 or a way for you to touch in with yourself
942.83 and address whether or not you are likely
945.04 to be able to form a certain habit easily
947.14 or whether or not it's going
to be very challenging.
949.23 And I'm going to teach you a way
950.75 to measure your degree of limbic friction.
953.16 That is, how much activation
energy it will take
955.73 in order for you to execute a new habit.
958.71 And I'm going to teach you
960.0 how to measure your limbic friction
961.59 and activation energy for how likely it is
963.97 that you're going to be
able to break a habit
966.34 that you don't want to have.
967.96 The other key concept for us to address
970.2 that's really mainly found in the books
972.24 and articles out there about habits,
974.22 is this notions of what
I call linchpin habits.
976.85 Linchpin habits are certain habits
978.91 that make a lot of other
habits easier to execute.
981.669 Now, the sorts of linchpin habits
983.88 that I'm referring to are
always going to be things
986.22 that you enjoy doing.
987.91 I'll just give you an
example from my life.
989.827 I happen to like exercise.
991.726 Not all forms of exercise,
993.306 but I happen to like resistance training
995.8 and I happen to like running.
997.26 So I'm personally in the habit
998.35 of getting cardiovascular
exercise 3 or 4 times per week.
1001.48 Maybe 30-60 minutes per session.
1004.15 And I'm in the habit of
doing resistance training 3
1006.91 or 4 times per week,
1008.38 typically also for about 45
to 60 minutes per session.
1011.99 Now, I enjoy those,
1013.169 and for reasons that I'll
get into a little bit later,
1015.81 I enjoy those activities
typically early in the day
1018.723 because of the neurochemistry
1020.186 and the various types
of hormones, et cetera,
1023.02 that are associates with
performing those activities.
1025.89 But I really place those
activities under the umbrella
1029.41 of what I call linchpin habits.
1032.03 Why? Because those
particular habits are easy
1034.76 to execute because I enjoy them.
1036.54 But they also make a lot of
other habits easier to execute.
1040.56 Things like being alert for work,
1042.696 things like making sure
1044.55 that I get good sleep the night before,
1046.28 things like hydration,
1047.53 things like making sure
that I eat the foods
1049.61 that are better for me than
some of the other foods
1052.32 that maybe I would more
reflexively reach to
1054.67 if I weren't doing that training.
1056.42 So certain habits act as linchpins,
1059.21 meaning that they shift
a lot of other things.
1061.37 They can control and
bias the likelihood that,
1064.174 in this case you or me,
1066.009 will perform other habits
that are harder to access,
1069.023 that we have less of an affinity for.
1072.14 So again,
1073.01 there's three concepts that
we need to include here.
1075.02 We've got identity-based
versus goal-based habits.
1078.04 We've got the concept that
typically different habits
1080.92 take different periods of time to adopt,
1083.07 depending on the person and the habit.
1084.8 And that there are these,
what I call linchpin habits.
1087.449 Certain habits that make other
habits easier to execute.
1091.03 And those linchpin habits
1092.38 always, always, always are
things that we enjoy doing.
1096.33 So our goal throughout this
episode is for you to identify
1099.05 which habits are easy for you to perform,
1102.09 which ones are hard for you to perform,
1104.04 and which habits you want to break.
1106.02 If you want to grab a pen
and paper, you can do that.
1108.1 Or if you want to dictate
some of that into your phone,
1110.21 you can.
1111.32 But right now, actually,
1112.36 if you just want to think
about these concepts,
1114.38 you can always go back later,
1115.688 I'll be sure to spell
out a very specific way
1118.66 that you can chart out a map
1120.41 towards forming particular habits
1121.857 and breaking particular habits later on.
1124.87 What I'd like us to do at this point is
1127.29 to take that concepts of limbic friction
1129.445 and for you to ask yourself
1131.526 what habits you perform on a daily basis,
1134.478 and these could be things as basic
1137.46 as brushing your teeth before breakfast,
1139.84 or brushing your teeth after breakfast.
1141.27 It could be, for instance,
that you get exercise
1143.95 or you get it at a particular time of day,
1145.51 or even that you take a
particular route to work, right?
1148.32 We are very habitual
1149.268 and we tend to do things
more or less over and over
1152.53 in the same way, unless
we intervene in ourselves.
1155.15 That's just the way that we are wired.
1156.703 So now I'd like you to shift
1158.38 to thinking about a
particular aspect of habits
1161.17 and that's habit strength.
1164.23 Now, you all have different habits.
1166.25 You probably brush your teeth
at a particular time of day,
1168.32 you probably exercise at
particular times of week,
1170.396 you probably go to the refrigerator
in a very habitual way.
1173.16 We are incredibly habitual organisms.
1176.35 Unless we intervene in our habits,
1177.81 they tend to carry out the
same way that they always have
1180.2 once they've formed.
1181.69 So you can do this exercise now,
1183.17 you don't have to write this
down if you don't want to,
1184.83 but you certainly are welcome.
1186.284 We're going to evaluate
what's called habit strength.
1189.3 That's not a concept that I created.
1190.85 Habit strength is something
1191.75 that you will find in the
psychological literature.
1194.21 Habit strength is measured
by two main criteria.
1197.43 The first, is how
context-dependent a give habit is.
1201.777 So, context dependence is,
1203.979 if you go from one
environment to the next,
1207.47 do you tend to do the same thing,
1209.05 in the same way, at the same time of day?
1211.29 So, for instance,
1212.123 brushing your teeth firs
thing in the morning.
1213.48 Maybe some of you do
that before breakfast,
1215.08 maybe some of you do that later,
1216.35 maybe some of you, like me,
don't even eat breakfast.
1218.377 But when I travel, I tend
to brush my teeth at more
1222.13 or less the same time of day
relative to when I wake up
1225.46 as I do when I'm at home.
1226.45 So it's context independent.
1228.31 So it's a very strong habit, right?
1231.44 There are certain behaviors,
1233.281 like perhaps what you eat,
1235.568 or, you know, perhaps how you dress,
1238.3 that are context independent,
1240.51 that you might perform
one way in one context,
1243.483 and another way in another context.
1245.8 The other aspect of habit strength is
1247.61 how much limbic friction is required
1249.76 to perform that habit on a regular basis.
1252.04 This is extremely important
1253.62 because if you are in the
process of building habits
1257.34 and consolidating those habits,
1259.193 then it's probably going to
take more limbic friction
1263.65 to execute those habits.
1265.27 What do I mean by that?
1266.103 Well, let's say you set out to get,
1268.726 let's say 45 minutes of zone
II cardio exercise every day,
1272.71 5 or maybe even 7 days a week.
1274.819 Well, if at first you're highly motivated,
1278.34 limbic friction might be pretty low.
1280.54 Limbic friction is how much top-down,
1282.74 meaning from your fore-brain
to your limbic system,
1284.94 the part of you brain that
generates autonomic responses,
1287.8 how much limbic friction,
1290.27 meaning conscious over-ride
of your state is required
1295.44 in order to engage in
that particular behavior.
1297.44 So, if you're feeling particularly tired
1298.76 and you don't want to get out of bed,
1300.16 and you don't want to go out
and do your zone II cardio,
1302.003 then there's a high
degree of limbic friction.
1304.534 It takes, some people
think of it as motivation,
1307.34 but motivation is a
bit of a vague concept,
1309.33 whereas limbic friction involves
specific neural circuits
1311.95 and you can think of it in a
more or less quantitative way.
1314.31 You can think of that
your body is very tired,
1316.82 so it's going to take more limbic friction
1318.46 in order to get into action.
1320.3 Right?
1321.133 You're going to have to
overcome more limbic friction,
1322.42 excuse me.
1323.253 Whereas if you're very, very alert,
1324.906 there's less limbic friction
1326.68 because you're moving toward something
1328.21 that's action oriented.
1329.84 However, the inverse is also true.
1331.628 Let's say that you are
trying to get into the habit,
1334.66 or you're in the early
stages of forming a habit
1336.91 to meditate regularly.
1338.245 That's a pretty quiescent
or calming activity,
1342.04 so if you're somebody
who comes home from work
1343.59 and you're very anxious and
you have a lot of work to do
1346.36 and you have to deal
with a bunch of things,
1348.03 there's a lot of limbic
friction to overcome
1350.29 in order to get into that calm state.
1352.426 So these two aspects, context dependence,
1355.86 whether or not you're like to do the thing
1357.52 regardless of where you are.
1359.62 Right? On travel, at home, on vacation,
1362.15 with people around, not
people around, et cetera.
1364.52 And how much limbic friction is required
1366.671 to execute that habit,
1368.43 will tell you whether or
not that habit is deeply
1370.55 or just shallowly embedded
within your nervous system.
1374.47 The goal of any habit that we want to form
1376.71 is to get into what's called automaticity.
1378.96 Automaticity is fancy language
1380.85 for the neural circuits can
perform it automatically,
1383.58 and that's the ultimate place to be.
1385.557 All right, if you have all these goals
1388.344 and things that you want to
be doing on a regular basis,
1390.4 you'd love for them to be habitual
1392.04 because it takes less
mental and physical effort,
1394.693 less limbic friction,
1396.34 in order to execute those.
1397.87 And so much of what's out there,
1399.87 again in the popular
psychology literature,
1402.36 in books that you'll find
on the bookstore shelf
1404.36 and on Amazon, and in the airports,
1406.15 are about how to get
1407.45 from that mode of high
degree of limbic friction
1409.87 to automaticity.
1411.17 And they offer a number of different ways,
1413.07 I think many of which are useful,
1414.497 trying to get you to organize
different types of habits
1417.22 into different bins, like
value-based, and goal-based,
1419.99 and trying to persuade you
1421.43 that structuring habits at
the particular times of day
1423.93 or in a particular way are
going to be beneficial,
1426.07 and indeed, I think they
have helped a lot of people.
1428.48 So what I'd like to do is to
take the scientific literature
1431.89 of how the nervous system learns
1433.61 and engages in plasticity,
1435.4 and apply that to habit formation,
1438.04 habit maintenance, and if so desired,
1440.92 how to break particular habits.
1443.06 I'd like to give you a particular tool
1444.85 that's gleaned from the
research psychology literature.
1447.45 I should mention that I learned about this
1450.58 from an excellent review article
1452.59 that's available online.
1453.57 It's called Psychology of Habit.
1455.39 The authors are Wendy
Wood and Dennis Ruenger,
1458.09 this is published in Annual
Review of Psychology.
1461.25 The Annual Reviews series is
a very high quality series.
1465.004 There are annual reviews of neuroscience,
1467.73 annual reviews of psychology,
1469.07 annual reviews of nutrition
science, et cetera.
1471.27 For those of you
1472.103 that are interested in
exploring review articles
1474.06 that are grounded in hundreds of quality,
1477.01 peer-reviewed studies,
1478.49 the Annual Review series
is really terrific.
1481.09 Certainly among the best, if not the best.
1483.32 And they also tend to be quite
long and quite comprehensive.
1485.91 So this review, Psychology
of Habit by Wood
1486.743 and Ruenger, is excellent.
1489.728 And here I'm more or less
paraphrasing from them,
1493.43 so I want to be clear that
these are their words, not mine.
1497.01 They're talking about the various ways
1499.639 that habits form in the nervous system
1501.617 and they mention, with
each repetition of a habit,
1505.997 small changes occur in the
cognitive and neural mechanisms
1509.199 associated with procedural memory.
1511.68 So I just want to talk for a second
1512.99 about what procedural memory is.
1514.578 In the neuroscience of memory,
1516.67 we distinguish between
what's called episodic memory
1519.31 and procedural memory.
1520.89 Episodic memory is a recall
of a particular set of events
1524.93 that happened,
1525.763 whereas procedural memory
1527.06 is holding in mind the
specific sequence of things
1529.84 that need to happen
1530.78 in order for a particular
outcome to occur.
1532.545 So think of it like a
recipe or a protocol,
1535.353 or for the sake of exercise,
1537.48 it's like sets and reps,
1538.56 or a particular course that
you're going to run or cycle,
1541.57 or the number of laps you're going to swim
1543.5 and how you're going to perform it.
1545.642 It's very clear that for anyone
trying to adopt new habits,
1549.838 getting into the mindset of
procedural memory is very useful
1554.04 for overcoming that barrier
that we call limbic friction.
1556.97 How do you do that?
1557.96 Well, a simple visualization exercise,
1560.66 or it doesn't even have
to be done eyes closed.
1563.377 You know, often times we
hear visualization exercise,
1565.64 you think about sitting in a
lotus position, eyes closed,
1567.79 you know, trying really
hard to visualize something.
1570.04 Doesn't need to be anything like that.
1572.01 It can simply be, if you are
deciding to adopt a new habit,
1576.259 to just think about the very
specific sequence of steps
1579.89 that's required to execute that habit.
1582.492 And I'll use a trivial example,
1584.654 but this could be applied to anything.
1586.66 Let's say I want to get into
the habit of making myself,
1589.67 or someone else in my household,
1591.13 a cup of espresso every morning,
1593.039 I would actually think
through each of those steps.
1596.69 Walk into the kitchen, turn
on the espresso machine,
1600.25 draw the espresso.
1601.27 Walking through each of those
steps, from start to finish,
1604.12 and it turns out just that
simple mental exercise done once
1607.423 can shift people towards
a much higher likelihood
1610.69 of performing that habit regularly,
1613.09 not just the first time,
1614.47 but as they continue out into the days
1616.99 and weeks that follow.
1618.17 So that's remarkable to me
1619.3 and the literature is really robust.
1621.33 Just one mental exercise
of thinking through
1624.043 what are the sequence of steps required
1627.07 in order to perform this
habit from start to finish
1629.304 can shift the likelihood of
being able to perform that habit
1633.39 from unlikely or moderately likely,
1635.79 to very likely over time.
1637.47 And that's because it
pulls from this process
1640.225 that involves our
hippocampus and our neocortex
1642.93 and other areas of our
brain and nervous system,
1645.35 that engage in procedural memory.
1646.91 It shifts the brain towards
a mindset, if you will.
1649.824 It's more of a neural circuit
set, would be more accurate.
1653.63 But a mindset/neural circuit set
1656.66 of doing things in a particular sequence,
1659.0 which allows that limbic
friction to come down
1661.79 and increases the likelihood
1663.23 that we're going to perform that thing.
1665.506 Simple tool but very powerful too,
1666.907 according to the psychology literature.
1668.55 And actually, the cellular
and molecular mechanisms
1670.78 that underlie that sort
of procedural memory,
1673.73 stepping through phenomenon are known.
1676.383 In this article I mentioned,
this beautiful review,
1679.87 they talk about so
called Hebbian learning.
1683.54 Donald Hebb was a psychologist in Canada
1686.25 and birthed this field
that has now lasted, gosh,
1689.88 more than 50 years and
is still very strong
1691.91 in neuroscience and psychology
of Hebbian learning.
1694.7 Hebbian learning is when
particular neurons are co-active,
1698.39 meaning when they fire together,
1699.68 they tend to strengthen their connections
1701.54 with one another.
1702.41 And it has a number of different cellular
1704.39 and molecular features
1705.36 that we don't have to go into in detail,
1706.76 but for those of you that want to know,
1708.01 I know some of you are hungry
1709.08 for a little bit more neuroscience,
1711.466 this involves things like NMDA receptors
1714.7 and methyl-D-aspartate receptors.
1717.153 NMDA receptors are
really important I think
1719.18 for everyone to understand.
1720.69 So I'll just tell you a
little bit about them.
1722.29 These are receptors that
are on the neuron's surface
1725.11 and normally they don't contribute much
1726.84 to the activity of those neurons.
1728.47 Those neurons are perfectly
capable of doing their thing
1730.72 without activation of this NMDA receptor.
1733.26 But when a neuron gets
a very strong input,
1735.9 a strong stimulus,
1737.44 that NMDA receptor triggers
a number of mechanisms
1740.374 that recruit
1741.85 to the surface of the
neuron more other receptors.
1744.45 In other words, it makes
that neuron more responsive
1747.46 to input in the future
1748.647 such that it doesn't
require so much input.
1751.41 In other words, it takes a neuron
1754.153 that is very unlikely to fire
1756.221 and makes it more likely to fire.
1758.44 So this procedural stepping through
1760.37 of the steps of the recipe
1761.67 or the series of actions
steps that are involved
1764.44 in sitting down to study
and writing for an hour,
1767.16 or generating exercise,
1768.74 whatever is the habit that
you're trying to learn.
1770.65 When you're doing that exercise,
1772.37 it's not as if your nervous system
1773.73 thinks you're actually
performing that behavior.
1775.59 Your nervous system isn't stupid.
1776.88 It's actually a lot smarter than that.
1778.53 It knows the difference between
a thought and an action,
1781.09 but when you do that,
1782.17 it sets in motion the same neurons
1784.37 that are going to be required
1786.06 for the execution of that habit.
1787.92 And so when you actually show
up to perform that habit,
1790.436 it's as if the dominoes fall more easily.
1793.6 It's a lower threshold, as we say,
1796.48 in order to get the habit to perform.
1798.53 So, Hebbian learning, NMDA receptors,
1800.87 all that nuts and bolts stuff.
1803.33 Really the guts of the
mechanisms of how this works.
1805.7 But for those of you that just want
1807.811 to be more habitual about certain things,
1809.96 be able to perform certain
things more reflexively,
1811.95 that you would like in your life,
1813.22 simply take the time,
do it once, maybe twice,
1816.2 and just sit down, close
your eyes if you like,
1818.65 and just step through the procedure
1820.22 of what it's going to take in
order to perform that habit.
1822.772 The psychology literature, as I mentioned,
1825.13 and also the neuroscience literature,
1826.926 strongly supports the fact
1828.649 that it is going to make it far easier
1831.24 for you to adopt and maintain that habit.
1833.68 And if you are somebody who
used to perform a habit,
1836.6 and you don't understand
why you dropped it,
1839.06 and you're frustrated with yourself,
1840.55 and you're trying to figure out
1841.72 how you can get back into that habit,
1843.8 well by all means,
1844.81 lean right back into that habit,
1846.15 but if you're having trouble doing that,
1847.487 also just use the
procedural memory exercise
1850.265 in order to shift your nervous system
1852.502 towards a higher likelihood
1854.777 that you will return to that habit
1857.14 just the same way I described for trying
1859.13 to initiate a new habit.
1860.81 So now I'd like to discuss a second,
1862.48 and what I think is perhaps
the most powerful tool
1865.115 for being able to acquire
and stick to new habits.
1870.29 This tool is rooted in what
we call neural circuits
1872.71 and I do think it is important
to understand a little bit
1875.21 about how those neural circuits work.
1877.42 For those of you that are saying,
1878.327 "Just tell me what to do."
1880.21 I have to say, as I always say,
1882.31 understanding a little bit or
a lot of underlying mechanism
1885.503 will help solidify these concepts for you
1889.22 and will help ensure that the tools
1891.22 that I offer are going to make sense
1893.24 and that they're going
1894.073 to make sense in differing contexts
1895.38 and for different types of habits
1896.88 that you're tying to learn.
1898.18 So, rather than just tell you what to do,
1899.87 I'm going to tell you how
this particular tool works,
1902.247 and then in doing that,
1903.77 you should be able to
apply it to any habit,
1905.55 under any conditions.
1906.792 The tool that I'm referring to
1908.776 is something called task-bracketing
1911.81 and the neural circuits
associated with task-bracketing
1914.92 are basically the neural circuits
1916.57 that are going to allow you
to learn any new type of habit
1920.13 or break any habit that
you'd like to break.
1922.568 We have in our brain a
set of neural circuits
1925.9 that fall under the umbrella
term of the basal ganglia.
1928.73 The basal ganglia are
involved in action execution,
1932.04 meaning doing certain things,
1933.59 and action suppression,
not doing certain things.
1938.54 In the experimental realm,
1940.19 these are referred to as go, meaning do,
1942.62 or no go, don't do, certain things.
1945.136 And some of us fall more into the category
1947.88 of we find it very easy
to do certain things,
1949.839 but harder to not do other things.
1952.97 Some people have a lot
of no go type circuits
1956.82 that are very robust,
1957.87 and they have a lot of
behavioral constraint,
1959.746 but they have a harder
time getting into action.
1962.01 And some people have a
perfect balance of both,
1963.95 but I've never met one of those people.
1965.826 So again, drawing from,
more or less paraphrasing
1969.73 from this beautiful review
that I described earlier
1972.94 in Annual Review of Psychology, excuse me,
1976.52 by Wood and Ruenger,
1977.821 task-bracketing involves a
particular set of neural circuits
1981.92 within the basal ganglia,
1983.65 so I'm going to describe this
here, again paraphrasing,
1987.24 a sensory-motor loop.
1988.51 Sensory means just input
coming in about sight, sounds,
1992.88 taste, et cetera.
1994.17 And then the motor systems,
1995.79 the systems of the brain and
body that generate action,
1998.48 taking that information
and generating action.
2000.788 So it turns out that there's
an area of our basal ganglia
2004.45 called the dorsolateral striatum,
2006.57 we can use the acronym DLS.
2008.57 Again, dorsolateral striatum.
2011.24 Dorso means up. Lateral means to the side.
2013.25 So dorsolateral.
2014.083 And striatum is a subdivision
of the basal ganglia.
2017.76 And it's very important
2019.383 for the establishment of behaviors
2022.23 that are associated with a habit,
2024.24 but not necessarily the habit itself.
2026.694 And beautiful studies in
both animals and humans
2030.22 that record the activity in
the dorsolateral striatum
2033.67 find that the dorsolateral
striatum is associated,
2037.43 meaning it becomes active at the beginning
2039.765 of a particular habit,
2041.748 and at the very end and
after a particular habit.
2045.43 Hence the phrase task-bracketing.
2047.73 It brackets the habit.
2049.4 Now, other sets of neurons
are going to be active
2051.46 during the actual execution of the habit,
2053.734 but what the literature on
the dorsolateral striatum
2057.28 tells us is that we have
particular circuits in our brain
2061.62 that are devoted to framing the events
2064.38 that happened just before
2066.3 and as we initiate a habit,
2067.86 and just after and as
we terminate a habit.
2070.75 In other words, it acts
as a sort of marker
2073.11 for the habit execution,
2074.32 but not the execution of the habit per se.
2077.35 This is very important
2078.61 because task-bracketing
is what underlies whether
2082.88 or not a habit will be
context dependent or not,
2086.32 whether or not it will be strong
2088.07 and likely to occur
2089.43 even if we didn't get good
night's sleep the night before,
2091.65 even if we're feeling distracted,
2093.41 even if we're not feeling like
doing something emotionally,
2096.83 or if we are, you know,
completely overwhelmed
2099.79 by other events.
2100.645 If the neural circuits
are task bracketing,
2103.481 are deeply embedded in us,
2105.51 meaning they are very robust
around a particular habit,
2108.61 well then it's likely
that we're going to go out
2110.23 for that zone II cardio no matter what,
2112.4 that we're going to brush
our teeth no matter what.
2113.997 I'm fact, brushing our teeth
is a pretty good example
2116.1 because, for most people,
2117.65 even if you got a terrible night's sleep,
2119.003 even If everything in
your life is going wrong,
2122.87 chances are, unless you're very depressed,
2125.46 if you're going to leave to work,
2126.6 or even if you're not,
2127.89 that you're going to still
carry out the behavior
2130.3 of brushing your teeth in the morning.
2131.61 I would hope so, actually.
2133.25 But you are probably less likely
2135.48 to perform particular habits
2137.54 that are not what you deem as necessary.
2141.04 But if you think about it,
2142.75 brushing your teeth, exercise,
eating particular foods,
2145.75 maybe engaging socially
in particular ways,
2149.05 you are the one that places
any kind of value assessment
2151.41 on which ones are essential,
2152.78 and which ones are negotiable.
2154.81 So task-bracketing sets a neural imprint,
2158.62 a kind of a finger print in your brain,
2160.17 of this thing has to happen
at this particular time of day
2163.33 so much so that it's reflexive.
2165.61 And as we'll talk about in a moment,
2167.37 there's a way that you can
build up task-bracketing
2170.75 so that regardless of what
it is you're trying to learn,
2173.67 there's a much higher probability
2175.49 that you're going to do that thing.
2177.26 And when I say learn,
2178.093 meaning let's say you're
trying to acquire a habit
2180.25 that for you is really challenging.
2181.66 Maybe it's that you're going
to write for an hour a day
2184.24 on a book project that
you've been thinking about
2186.19 or you're going to work on mathematics,
2188.25 or you're going to do any sort of thing
2189.94 that for you there's a
lot of limbic friction.
2192.057 While it is important to think
about the sequence of events
2195.9 that would be required in order
to engage in that behavior,
2198.46 that procedural memory
visualization exercise
2201.02 we talked about before, that will help,
2202.832 there's a way also that you
can orient your nervous system
2206.391 towards this task-bracketing process,
2209.213 so that your nervous system is shifted
2212.21 or oriented towards the
execution of a given habit.
2215.56 So this is sort of like warming
up your body to exercise.
2219.16 When the dorsolateral striatum is engaged,
2221.69 your body and you brain are
primed to execute a habit
2224.87 and that you get to consciously insert
2226.66 which habit you want to perform.
2228.22 So in order to leverage
the neural mechanisms
2230.136 of task-bracketing,
2231.513 in order to increase the likelihood
2233.89 that you're going to
perform a particular habit,
2236.64 I have to break it to you
2238.36 that one thing that you've
probably heard over and over
2241.72 about habit formation
2243.03 is not true.
2244.695 And what I'm referring to is this idea
2247.27 that if you're very specific
about exactly when you're going
2250.58 to perform a particular habit,
2252.91 that you're more likely
to perform that habit.
2255.53 And while that is true in the short term,
2258.57 it is not true in the long term.
2260.813 And the reason for that is
that our nervous system tends
2264.27 to generate particular kinds of behavior
2266.72 based not on time, but on our state.
2270.109 Meaning what level of
activation is taking place
2273.42 in our brain and body.
2274.45 How much focus we happen to have,
2276.1 how fatigued we are, how energized we are.
2279.36 So while schedules are important,
2281.86 it's not the particular time of day per se
2285.21 that's going to allow
you to get into a habit,
2288.03 and form that habit, and
consolidate that habit.
2290.66 Rather, it's the state that your brain
2293.12 and body are in that's
important to anchor yourself to.
2296.25 So now I'm going to offer you a tool.
2298.3 It's actually an entire program
2299.815 by which you can insert
particular habits and activities
2303.65 at particular phases of the day,
2305.48 not times of day, but phases of the day,
2307.86 because it turns out that
particular phases of the day
2310.6 are associated with particular
biological underpinnings,
2313.91 chemicals and neural
circuits and so forth,
2316.27 and in doing so it will
make it far more likely
2319.04 that you will be able to
regularly engage in these habits
2321.797 and activities over a long period of time.
2324.707 And whether or not that
will move you from somebody
2326.79 who ordinarily would take
200 days to form a habit
2329.93 to one of those 18 days to habit people
2332.78 in that earlier study I
mentioned, I don't know.
2334.68 But I am certain that will
have a significant shift
2337.98 on allowing you to engage in
particular habits more easily
2341.4 and to consolidate those
habits more quickly.
2343.71 So the program I am about to describe,
2345.62 I formulated for you based on
the neuroscience literature,
2349.15 and the psychology literature of learning,
2350.8 and this concepts of task-bracketing.
2353.08 It involves the 24 hour days
into what I call three phases.
2357.47 The first is phase one,
2359.32 which is 0 to 8 hours after
waking up, approximately.
2364.02 Okay, you can put a plus
or minus 30 minutes on this
2366.84 for yourself.
2368.22 The second phase is the
9 to 14, maybe 15 hours
2372.517 after you wake up.
2374.199 And the third phase is 16
to 24 hours after waking up.
2378.21 So we've taken the 24 hour cycle,
2379.77 we've carved it up into three phases,
2381.73 phase one, phase two, and phase three.
2383.95 Now, everything I'm describing,
2385.84 or at least the way I'm
going to describe it,
2387.79 is based on what I would
call a typical schedule,
2390.42 diurnal schedule.
2391.58 You've heard of nocturnal?
2392.61 Well, we are diurnal.
2394.38 Most of us are asleep at night
and awake during the day.
2396.89 I do realize that a number
of people have shift work
2400.11 or they have newborns or other reasons
2402.18 why they have to be up in
the middle of the night
2403.73 and sleeping during the day.
2405.113 If that's the case,
2406.2 please listen to the
episode we did on jet-lag
2409.5 and shift work because
that has a lot of tools
2411.25 specifically for that population.
2413.49 But most people go to sleep
somewhere around 10:00 PM,
2417.22 plus or minus two hours,
2418.69 and wake up some time around 7:00 AM,
2421.43 plus or minus two hours.
2423.09 So today, I'm going to
use the to bed at 10:00 PM
2426.2 and a wake up time of 7:00
AM as the framework for this,
2430.38 but you could adopt it easily
to your particular schedule.
2433.334 Phase one, which again, is
0 to 8 hours after waking,
2437.409 has a particular neurochemical signature.
2440.66 Regardless of what you do,
2442.659 the neuromodulators norepinephrine
2445.016 as well as epinephrine,
2446.63 so that's noradrenaline and adrenaline,
2448.71 as well as the neuromodulator dopamine
2451.08 tend to be elevated during
that first 0 to 8 hours
2454.28 after waking.
2455.91 There are a number of reasons
for this related to the fact
2459.376 that also cortisol is higher
in our brain and bloodstream,
2461.68 it's a healthy level of
cortisol upon waking,
2463.86 body temperature is increased, et cetera.
2465.88 And there's several things
2467.08 that perhaps we should all be doing,
2468.82 I've talked about many of
these on the podcast before,
2470.819 that in addition to those chemicals,
2473.69 further support an
alert and focused state.
2477.12 And I'll just list those off.
2478.47 I've done many podcasts on each of these
2480.89 if you'd like to access those
podcasts you can find them
2483.235 in the menu of podcasts on YouTube,
2485.99 Apple, Spotify, et cetera.
2487.51 They involve, for instance,
2488.83 viewing sunlight or
bright artificial light
2492.01 if you can't access sunlight,
2493.16 within the first 30 minutes of waking.
2495.67 Physical exercise of some kind
2497.443 in this phase of the day,
0 to 8 hours of the day,
2501.1 ideally pretty early in that phase,
2503.42 but, you know,
2504.253 if it has to be at the 7
to 8 hour transition point
2507.3 that's fine too.
2508.44 Cold exposure in the form
of cold showers or ice baths
2511.75 or outside with minimal clothing,
2514.477 appropriate yet minimal clothing.
2517.514 Caffeine ingestion.
2519.597 Fasting, for instance,
not ingesting calories,
2524.52 also will lend itself to
increased norepinephrine
2526.977 and dopamine, et cetera.
2528.73 If you are going to consume foods,
2530.19 foods that are rich in
things like tyrosine,
2532.41 which is a precursor for dopamine.
2534.053 You can look up foods
that are high in tyrosine.
2537.32 And for those of you that are
interested in supplementation
2539.68 and like to use those routes,
2541.1 things like alpha GPC or
phenylethylamine, think,
2544.72 or L-tyrosine,
2545.76 if that's in keeping with
what you're able to do.
2548.47 Of course, consult your doctor
2550.06 if you're going to rely
on supplementation.
2552.27 What's this all about?
2553.14 Well, the already elevated norepinephrine
2555.76 and dopamine, the sunlight, exercise,
2558.68 cold exposure, caffeine,
tyrosine, et cetera,
2561.43 all of those place the
brain and body into a state
2564.618 in which you are better able,
2568.32 or I would say, more easily able,
2570.42 to engage in activities
2572.41 that have a high degree limbic friction
2575.66 and where you need to
override that limbic friction.
2578.3 Right? We've heard that the
morning is kind of sacred,
2580.67 conquer the hardest things
first thing in the morning,
2582.62 and that's been discussed in
the pop psychology literature
2585.82 and in the habit formation literature
2588.06 merely from the perspective of
2590.29 get it out of the way so you can feel good
2591.9 about having done it.
2593.49 But what I'm referring
to is quite different.
2595.05 What I'm referring to is
a particular phase of day
2597.143 that after rising, after
waking up, that is,
2600.298 for 0 to 8 hours, right,
in that first phase,
2604.13 your whole system is
action and focus oriented.
2607.5 And we know that when you're
action and focus oriented
2610.34 and because of the neurochemicals
2612.54 that are naturally released
in your brain and body
2615.187 that you will be more likely
to overcome any limbic friction
2619.64 that stands in the way of
performing particular habits.
2622.74 So, as you list out or think
about the various habits
2626.09 that you'd like to adopt in
your life, take the habits
2630.01 for which you know
there's the highest degree
2632.37 of limbic friction,
2633.53 they are the hardest for you to engage in,
2635.6 they require the most activation energy,
2637.93 and put those in this 0
to 8 hours after waking.
2641.616 This will greatly
facilitate your performance
2645.34 of those new habits.
2646.5 I'm certain of that.
2647.618 And in addition to that,
2649.57 by doing them in this
particular phase of the day,
2652.57 not necessarily the same time,
2654.02 I mean, if you want to be very habitual,
2655.45 and you want to do,
you know, the exercise,
2657.16 or the sunlight viewing
always at the same time,
2659.4 or you want to do,
2660.61 you want to drink your caffeine
2662.03 always at the exact
same time, that's fine,
2663.59 but by placing them in this broader window
2666.33 of 0 to 8 hours after waking,
2668.533 what you're doing is you're
creating task-bracketing.
2672.04 You're making it such
that your nervous system
2674.23 will predict when you are going to lean in
2677.14 against limbic friction
2678.63 in order to perform
particular types of habits.
2681.41 And this is very different than saying,
2683.277 "I'm always going to run" or,
2684.917 "I'm always going to study from
10 to 12 AM every morning."
2689.14 That's great, and if you
can do that, terrific.
2691.51 But the literature indicates
that people who do that,
2693.73 who are very rigid about
when they do things tend,
2695.742 because of context dependence,
2697.79 to not necessarily stick
to those habits over time.
2700.98 Some people do, but
many, many people don't.
2704.0 So think about the hardest habits to form
2706.06 and the habits that you most want to form
2708.89 that are hardest for you
to adopt and to maintain
2711.44 and I highly suggest
placing those somewhere
2714.327 within this phase one of
0 to 8 hours after waking.
2718.52 Now of course, some of
the things I listed out,
2720.75 sunlight viewing, exercise, cold exposure,
2723.019 caffeine, fasting,
2724.64 those might be the
actual habits themselves,
2726.4 but here I realize, or
rather I want to acknowledge
2730.081 that many people, including myself,
2732.064 are doing some or all
of these things already
2734.73 and many people, including myself,
2736.78 are trying to adopt new habits
2738.64 that don't fall into the category
2740.44 of just trying to set your overall state.
2742.82 Again, norepinephrine, dopamine,
2744.81 and all these neural systems
2746.06 will be greatly elevated in
this 0 to 8 hours after waking.
2749.7 However, the other things I mentioned,
2751.51 sunlight exposure,
exercise, cold exposure,
2753.92 caffeine, fasting, if that's for you,
2756.2 or if you're eating during that phase,
2758.201 eating things that contain some
2760.1 or elevated levels of tyrosine,
2761.66 maybe supplementing alpha
GPC or L-tyrosine, et cetera.
2765.133 All of those things further
facilitate the neurochemistry
2769.431 and therefore the state of mind
2771.28 that's going to be ideal for
leaning into limbic friction
2774.55 and overriding that limbic friction
2776.16 so that you can regularly
perform that habit.
2778.15 What we're really talking about here
2779.32 is leveraging neural systems
2781.29 in order to help you make it more likely
2784.13 that you're going to be able to engage
2785.74 and maintain a particular habit.
2787.66 So what I'm referring to as
phase one of each day is useful
2791.57 for acquiring certain habits,
2793.62 but there are other phases of the day,
2795.42 and those turn out to be useful
2796.8 for acquiring other types of habits.
2798.641 Phase two, as I mentioned, is about,
2801.225 again these aren't specifics,
2803.533 but about 9 to 14 or
15 hours after waking.
2807.442 During this phase of the day,
2809.94 because of the circadian
shifts in our biology,
2813.001 the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine
2815.29 that's circulating in our brain
2816.57 and bloodstream tends
to start to come down
2819.809 and levels of cortisol
tend to start to come down.
2823.6 That's the ideal circumstance.
2825.02 In fact,
2826.471 you don't really want elevated
cortisol late in the day.
2828.01 That's actually a signature of depression
2829.73 and anxiety and a number of
other unfortunate things.
2833.977 So, 9 to 14 hours after waking dopamine
2838.23 and norepinephrine and cortisol
are starting to taper down,
2840.7 just naturally.
2841.66 And a different neuromodulator, serotonin,
2845.28 is starting to rise.
2846.427 Serotonin is definitely
going to be highest
2849.84 in this second half of the day
2851.95 and tends to lend itself to a
more relaxed state of being.
2856.69 Now of course,
2857.523 I do realize that some people
are less of morning people
2860.1 and do find that they really come alive
2861.57 and awake in the afternoon,
2862.63 but most people don't
fall into that category.
2865.28 Most people feel more
alert early in the day,
2867.62 even anxious early in the day,
2869.19 and then, as the afternoon progresses,
2870.68 they tend to be a bit more
sleepy, a bit more relaxed,
2873.86 a bit more calm.
2875.68 There's certain things that we all can
2877.97 and should do during this
phase two of each day
2880.902 that lend themselves to a state of mind
2883.851 and a state of body that
is going to be beneficial
2887.524 for the generation and consolidation
2890.32 of certain types of habits.
2891.97 What are those things?
2892.85 First of all, as the day goes on,
2894.823 you should try if you can
2896.63 to start tapering the amount
of light that you're viewing.
2899.364 Now, this doesn't mean putting yourself
2900.197 into dim light at 3 o'clock
4 o'clock in the afternoon.
2905.775 That's certainly not the case.
2906.608 Simply that you want to
start tapering off the amount
2909.2 of really bright light
that you're getting,
2910.8 unless it's sunlight.
2911.792 Talked about this before on the podcast,
2914.22 but if you haven't heard,
2915.82 viewing the sun as it's at
what we call low solar angle
2919.06 so it's headed toward the horizon,
2921.14 you don't necessarily
have to watch the sunset,
2922.93 although that can be nice.
2924.17 But getting some sun light in your eyes
2925.55 in the second half of the
day can also be beneficial
2927.69 for a number of brain systems
and psychological systems
2930.598 so you can get some
some light in your eyes,
2932.66 you can certainly have
artificial lights on,
2935.53 but you want to start dimming those lights
2938.246 and bringing them actually
physically lower in the room
2939.68 because the neurons in your eye
2941.76 that view the upper visual field
2944.4 they actually trigger
this alertness mechanism
2946.78 in the brain and body.
2947.613 And in the second half of the day,
2949.18 even if you're humming
around and doing work at 3
2951.71 or 4 or 5 or even 7 PM,
2953.825 you are probably headed toward
sleep a few hours later,
2957.73 so things like limiting
the total amount of light
2960.02 if you can,
2961.08 things like NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,
2964.21 another thing that I've
talked about on this podcast.
2966.21 If you haven't heard about this before,
2967.43 non-sleep deep rest is an umbrella term
2969.38 for things like
meditation, for Yoga Nidra,
2972.7 a very powerful science supported tool
2975.31 for teaching you how to relax,
2977.437 things like self-hypnosis
2979.25 which might sound a little
kooky to some of you,
2980.86 but actually is a clinically based tool
2982.38 for which there's a lot
of scientific literature.
2984.68 If you're interested in that
2985.61 there's a great free
resource called Reverie,
2987.75 R E V E R I E .com.
2989.842 There's a app for both Apple and Android.
2993.08 This is an app that was
developed by colleagues of mine
2995.32 and researchers at Stanford
School of Medicine.
2997.6 You can do these short
15 self hypnosis script,
3000.98 as they're called.
3001.813 They can teach you how to relax yourself,
3003.83 there's even one for focus,
for sleep, for chronic pain,
3006.708 Again, all very strongly supported
3009.04 by quality peer-reviewed literature.
3011.26 So things like Reverie, meditation,
3013.325 things like heat and sauna,
hot baths, hot showers.
3017.679 Those are terrific things
to do in the second half
3020.89 of the day,
3021.74 they tend to support this serotonergic,
3024.11 or high serotonin like state
3025.99 and lend themselves to
more calm and relaxation.
3029.7 For those that are interested
in supplementation,
3031.8 there's always ashwagandha,
3033.51 which reduces cortisol,
3035.61 again peaks in cortisol
late in the afternoon
3038.03 and evening are associated
with depression,
3039.8 anxiety, and so forth.
3040.94 Ashwagandha has a pretty potent
cortisol inhibiting tool.
3046.179 I personally don't use it very often
3048.79 and I caution people about using it
3050.72 for longer than two-week periods of time
3052.37 without taking some breaks.
3053.65 You can look up more about
ashwagandha on examine.com.
3056.97 There's a lot of traffic literature
3058.19 with links to studies there.
3059.68 But basically this phase two of the day
3061.81 is one in which you're
alert, you are present
3064.26 you are working, you
are engaging socially,
3066.18 you're cooking dinner probably,
3067.47 paying attention to a number of things,
3069.1 but you should really be trying
3070.11 to taper off your stress level.
3071.93 So how do you leverage
phase two of the day
3073.82 for habit formation?
3075.325 Well, given what we know
3076.51 about the neurochemistry
of learning and memory,
3078.67 given what we know about task formation
3080.8 and its reliance on certain
forms of neuroplasticity,
3083.323 the second half of the
day is a terrific time
3085.685 to take on habits and things
that you're already doing
3090.95 that require very little
override of limbic friction.
3094.3 So these might be things that
categorize in common terms
3098.77 as kind of mellower activities.
3100.27 It might be journaling,
3101.439 it might be that you
already are performing music
3106.11 or I should say,
practicing music regularly,
3108.371 but there's a particular type of music
3110.54 that is hard for you
3111.7 or that you're working on a
particular piece of music,
3113.58 or you're trying to learn a language.
3114.63 Something that's a little bit challenging,
3116.11 but doesn't require a ton of energy
3118.91 in order to override that limbic friction.
3121.09 The second half of the day is
a much better time to do that.
3123.61 Less resistance, as we might say.
3125.999 But of course, resistance
has a neural substrate
3128.699 and the reason for doing those things
3130.65 in the second part of the
day, the so-called phase two,
3133.31 as I've called it, part of the day is
3135.12 because your ability
3136.39 to override resistance
is really diminished
3139.04 in this second phase of the day.
3140.999 Some of you might say,
3142.447 "Whoa wait,"
3143.28 "I like to exercise in the
second half of the day."
3145.227 "That's actually when I
have the most energy."
3146.897 "That's when I feel warmer"
3148.467 "I'm not a morning exerciser."
3149.8 That's absolutely fine,
3151.77 but what I'm referring
to is the acquisition
3153.63 of new behaviors
3154.736 and placing those consistently
at the second half of the day
3158.43 in order to engage these
task-bracketing mechanisms
3161.05 that I talked about before.
3162.583 One of the hallmark features
3164.67 of those basal ganglia circuits for go
3166.78 and no-go is that they are associated
3169.13 with certain neurochemicals,
dopamine and serotonin,
3172.2 acetylcholine, and other neurochemicals.
3174.28 And by placing particular habits
3176.681 at particular phases of the day,
3178.71 those neurochemical states
start to be associated
3181.22 with the leaning in and
the process of beginning,
3184.02 and as I mentioned, ending
those particular habits.
3186.85 And in doing so they shift
the whole nervous system
3189.73 toward being able to predict
3190.881 that certain things are going to happen
3192.81 at particular times a day,
3194.56 that you're going to be leaning very hard
3196.68 against limbic friction early
in the day in phase one,
3199.15 and that you're going to be doing things
3200.37 that require less conscious
override of limbic friction
3203.59 in phase two.
3204.423 And in doing so, set up
task-bracketing system
3207.294 so that the individual
habits that you're learning
3210.66 or that you're trying to learn
3212.12 have a much greater
probability of being executed
3215.01 and consolidated,
3216.13 meaning that pretty soon that they
3218.05 will just naturally become reflexive.
3220.32 And as with phase one, many
of the things that I mentioned
3224.01 that support this, what I'm
calling a serotonergic state
3227.7 or more relaxed state in phase two,
3229.616 things like seeing
sunlight in the afternoon,
3232.751 but not a lot of bright light
from artificial sources,
3236.64 things like NSDR,
3238.05 things like heat and sauna,
3240.284 hot baths et cetera, ashwagandha,
3242.542 again all of those things
themselves could be habits
3245.21 that you're trying to adopt, right?
3246.98 In that case, do those if
you'd like to explore them.
3250.11 They are quite beneficial
for a number of reasons,
3253.0 not just related to execution
of particular habits
3255.51 in phase two of the day,
3256.87 but also for improving quality of sleep
3259.32 and consolidating any learning
3260.98 that you might have
triggered earlier in the day.
3262.6 I've talked about that before,
3263.65 but just briefly, as a relevant aside,
3266.177 neuroplasticity involves
triggering the neural plasticity,
3270.1 setting it in motion,
3271.46 but the actual rewiring of the brain
3273.67 and the reconfiguration of neurons
3275.17 that will allow that
learning to be reflexive,
3277.24 that actually occurs
during states of deep rest,
3279.43 like an NSDR and like deep sleep.
3282.389 And I should just mention,
3283.808 for those of you that can only exercise
3286.32 or prefer to exercise in
phase two of the day, right,
3290.16 9 to 14 hours or 15 hours after waking,
3292.728 that's absolutely fine.
3294.599 However, because of
the importance of sleep
3297.708 and in particular deep
sleep throughout the night
3300.25 for not just neuroplasticity,
3301.87 but recovery of muscle and other tissues
3304.346 that are taxed during physical exercise,
3307.601 if you do train in phase two,
3310.26 I highly recommend, highly recommend
3312.197 that you start doing some
NSDR activity after you train,
3316.18 within an hour or two,
3317.3 because that will allow
you to taper down and relax
3319.68 so that you can get into
the next phase we're going
3321.65 to talk about, which is phase three.
3323.71 Phase three of the 24-hour schedule runs
3327.03 from about 16 to 24 hours after waking.
3331.31 During that period of time,
3332.925 there are few things
3334.01 that are going to support
being in a state of mind,
3336.595 state of body that are going
to allow neuroplasticity
3340.91 to occur, that are going
to allow the rewiring
3343.31 that you've triggered during
the waking part of the day
3345.88 to actually take place.
3347.266 Those things are very low to no light,
3350.655 meaning keeping your environment very dark
3353.39 or very, very dim.
3354.586 I don't think it's
necessary to sleep in a room
3357.62 that's complete blackness.
3359.069 I think that's a little bit overkill,
3361.235 but for most people keeping the room dark
3363.836 and keeping the room temperature
low is very beneficial
3367.92 for getting and staying in deep sleep.
3370.965 The body has to drop
by about 1 to 3 degrees
3374.08 in order to get into
sleep and stay asleep,
3376.77 so low light, low temperature environment,
3379.55 you can always pile on blankets of course
3381.38 if you don't want to be cold at night,
3383.2 you want to be warm enough,
3384.37 but you want your environment to be cold.
3386.5 Typically people aren't eating
in the middle of the night,
3389.217 although one thing that can
be useful is to make sure
3392.43 that you're at least well-fed enough
3394.72 when you head into this third
phase of every 24-hour day
3398.1 that you're not awake
because you're hungry.
3400.56 A lot of people recommend putting a gap
3402.65 between your final bite of food
3404.01 and when you got to sleep at night.
3405.46 Some people say that
gap should be 4 hours,
3407.51 other people say 2 hours,
3409.35 if you're me, I generally
have something, I don't know,
3411.47 within 2 hours or 90
minutes of going to sleep,
3414.19 but it's not a big meal,
but that's just me,
3415.32 and I fall asleep and stay
asleep fine with that.
3417.591 You have to experiment for yourself.
3419.494 I've talked about supplements
3421.48 that can support sleep in
previous episode of the podcast,
3424.13 things like magnesium threonate,
3425.86 or magnesium bisglycinate,
3427.5 things like theonine, apigenin.
3429.97 If you'd like to read more about those,
3431.67 we actually have a newsletter
3432.97 that I'll just quickly refer you to
3434.46 this is the Huberman Lab
Neural Network Newsletter,
3437.63 you can sign up for it by
going to hubermanlab.com,
3440.01 it's very easy to find,
3441.34 but even if you don't sign up,
3443.38 you can go to the toolkit
for sleep that's listed there
3446.41 and that tool kit is not just supplements,
3448.21 that tool kit is a number
of different things,
3449.98 both behavioral and supplement-based
3452.8 and nutrition-based, et cetera,
3454.44 that can allow you to get in to sleep
3457.12 and to stay asleep more readily.
3458.71 It's totally zero cost,
3459.82 you can find that again
at hubermanlab.com.
3461.88 So things like low light, low temperature,
3463.535 the supplements I mentioned,
3464.869 adjusting your eating
schedule appropriately,
3467.263 obviously not drinking caffeine
in the middle of the night
3470.13 or too close to bed,
3471.03 that's going to be critical.
3471.94 In fact, ideally you
wouldn't ingest any caffeine
3474.98 in phase two of the day,
3476.66 so that you could get into
this deeper state of rest
3479.003 in which habit formation and
neural plasticity can occur.
3484.42 What if you wake up?
3485.85 The way I've cast phase three is
3487.69 that you're supposed to
be in this deep slumber,
3489.73 you're not supposed to wake up at all,
3491.42 you're supposed to be in low light
3492.65 and your brain is rewiring
3493.84 and those habits are getting
consolidated, et cetera.
3496.74 Well, if you're like me,
3497.803 you probably get up once
in the middle of the night.
3499.59 Maybe go use the restroom.
3500.66 Perfectly normal, perfectly normal,
3502.39 but a lot of people have
trouble falling back asleep.
3504.473 Very important if you get up
in the middle of the night
3506.9 to use a minimum of light
3508.16 in order to navigate your surroundings,
3509.68 just as much as you need
in order to safely do so,
3512.23 because light inhibits hormone melatonin,
3515.236 can make it very hard
to fall back to sleep
3517.19 if you inhibit melatonin.
3518.87 The effects of light inhibiting melatonin
3520.186 are actually very potent.
3521.6 It happens very, very quickly,
3523.2 so try and keep the lights low.
3524.63 And you have trouble falling back asleep,
3527.44 that's when you might
also want to use something
3529.58 like a Reverie app,
3530.713 they have a sleep script there
3532.36 that can hopefully help
you get back to sleep.
3534.49 Or something like NSDR,
3535.89 you can find NSDR scripts on YouTube.
3537.93 These are zero cost.
3539.26 You can look up one
3540.093 that I particularly like is NSDR Madefor.
3542.34 It's a company I'm associated with,
3544.04 but the NSDR is completely zero cost,
3546.35 and there are other things,
3547.67 like Yoga Nidra, which you can
find scripts for elsewhere.
3550.32 Again, all of these
habits or these behaviors,
3553.04 these do's and don'ts around phase three,
3554.81 themselves might be habits
3557.37 that you're trying to create for yourself.
3559.58 But again, phase three is
really about making sure
3561.84 that whatever limbic
friction you've been able
3564.14 to override in phase one
3565.68 and trigger some new habit, right?
3567.35 Forcing yourself to write
3569.87 or forcing yourself to study
3571.09 or forcing yourself to exercise
3572.51 during that high limbic friction state.
3574.708 And then whatever things
you've been doing in phase two,
3577.2 which are habits
3578.11 that hopefully have moved
a little bit further
3579.72 along the continuum of newly-formed
3582.18 versus all the way to reflexive,
3583.712 or things that take less limbic
friction in in order to do.
3586.376 Phase three is when all
of that gets really locked
3589.62 into the nervous system
3590.5 through those Hebbian mechanisms,
3592.25 like NMDA receptors, et cetera,
3594.1 that I talked about before.
3595.1 Again, neuroplasticity is
the basis of habit formation
3598.74 and neuroplasticity and the
rewiring of neural circuits
3601.24 happens in these states of deep sleep.
3602.81 So if you're not obeying this phase three,
3606.411 if you're not giving phase
three the material it needs,
3610.36 and you're and you're not
avoiding the certain things,
3612.07 like caffeine and bright light
and stress during phase 3,
3616.21 you're simply not going to
be able to build those habits
3618.824 that you've been working so
hard to trigger in phase one
3621.737 and phase two of the day.
3624.2 Again, these are things
3625.57 that I've talked about previous
episodes of the podcast
3628.24 and elsewhere, but really
this is about habit formation.
3631.718 And the whole reason
3633.163 for placing particular types of behaviors
3635.586 at particular phases of the
day is to set a framework
3639.562 for that task-bracketing.
3641.78 Again, task-bracketing
3643.47 and the circuits of the basal ganglia
3645.52 indicate that it's not
just the neural circuits
3648.19 that are engaged by the task itself,
3651.34 but the neural circuits
that are engaged before
3654.32 and after that task execution.
3657.6 That's what gets consolidated.
3659.64 So when you do things that
particular phases of the day,
3662.647 under particular conditions
of neurochemistry,
3665.93 what you're doing is
3666.763 you're giving the brain a very
predictable set of sequences
3669.6 that during sleep it can start
to put into your hard drive,
3673.7 if you will.
3674.533 It can really program it
into your nervous system,
3676.57 so that within a short period of time,
3678.81 hopefully within 18 or maybe even 6 days
3682.25 or who knows? Maybe even fewer days,
3684.19 you'll find that executing
those behaviors is very,
3687.25 very straightforward for you
3688.49 and that you won't have to
feel so much limbic friction
3692.01 or override so much limbic friction.
3694.15 Some of you are probably asking, okay,
3696.156 if I perform a particular
habit during phase one,
3700.273 and then I do other
habits during phase two,
3702.96 and I eventually get to the point
3704.46 where I'm engaging in those habits
3706.37 in a pretty effortless way,
3708.874 do I keep them in the
same phase of the day?
3711.58 And the good news is, the
literature says it doesn't matter.
3714.58 And in fact,
3715.413 moving that particular habit
around somewhat randomly
3718.79 can actually be beneficial to you
3720.24 because actually moving
it from one time a day
3722.59 to the other is that context independence
3725.24 that we really are seeking.
3727.113 By being able to do the same
thing that we want to do
3731.03 regardless of time of day or circumstances
3733.91 that's how we know
3734.86 that we've achieved a
real habit formation,
3737.18 that's how we know that
the habit has been moved
3739.81 into certain components
of our neural circuity
3741.89 that just allow us to do it
3743.19 what seems like reflexively.
3744.56 Although earlier I pointed out
3745.68 that these aren't reflexes
in the traditional sense.
3748.477 The reason for that is
that this brain area,
3752.034 the hippocampus, that many
of you know is associated
3754.96 with learning and memory,
3755.96 is not actually where memories are stored.
3758.34 The hippocampus is where
memories are formed,
3760.74 it's where procedures, like
we talked about before,
3763.21 procedural memory of how you're going
3764.66 to execute a particular sequence,
3766.21 where that's maintained.
3767.74 So like if we use the recipe model,
3769.61 that's where the recipe is maintained
3771.55 until you know how to cook that dish
3773.72 and then the procedural
memory literally migrates off
3777.939 into a different set of neural circuits,
3780.24 which are the neural
circuits of the neocortex
3782.5 where we have maps of sensory experience,
3785.58 maps of all kinds experiences,
3788.156 including motor maps of
how to execute things.
3790.46 So we use one part of the
brain to learn something,
3793.0 but then that information,
3794.48 in the form of the electrical
activity of neurons,
3796.93 is passed off to a different brain area.
3800.09 Now, the neurons themselves don't move
3801.96 from the hippocampus to the cortex,
3803.45 that doesn't happen.
3804.283 What happens is the signals,
3806.35 the sequence of electrical firing,
3808.06 much like a script for a movie
3811.2 or the notes on a sheet of paper
3813.791 for a particular musical piece
3816.041 is transferred off to
a different brain area.
3818.644 So, that whole process
3820.97 of really leaning into
something that's hard,
3822.767 and then it becoming easier,
3824.09 and then eventually that
things becoming more
3825.79 or less reflexive involves a migration
3828.1 of the information in the brain.
3829.743 And once it's migrated out
3831.651 to a different location in the brain,
3833.73 at that point it's achieved
context-independence.
3837.0 It doesn't have to be
bracketed by, you know,
3840.51 your caffeine and your lunch.
3842.1 It doesn't have to occur immediately
3845.0 after your afternoon NSDR,
3846.81 but before your four
O'clock meeting on Zoom,
3849.78 or something of that sort.
3851.1 So all this is to say
3853.36 that once something has become reflexive,
3855.358 you should play with it a
little bit about time of day.
3858.17 If you want to keep it in
the same phase of day, great.
3860.866 But if you one day decide
3862.736 you're going to exercise in the afternoon,
3864.457 the next day you decide
3865.95 you're going to exercise in the morning,
3866.98 and that's the habit that
you're concerned with,
3869.5 that's terrific.
3870.333 If you're able to do that, that means
3871.166 that it's truly achieved
context-independence.
3872.84 It means that you have
officially formed that habit.
3875.4 And as I mentioned earlier,
3876.909 much earlier at the
beginning of the episode,
3879.258 the strength of a habit is dictated by
3881.88 how much limbic friction, that was one,
3885.282 and how much context dependence there is.
3888.65 So when it doesn't take
much activation energy
3891.31 to get into the execution of that habit
3893.47 and you can do it in any context, well,
3895.89 then you have formed a habit.
3897.558 We really can't have a discussion
about learning anything,
3899.887 habits or otherwise,
3901.811 unless we talk about
reward prediction error.
3904.931 Reward prediction error is associated
3907.8 with the molecule dopamine,
3909.28 although I should say there
are other neurochemicals
3911.56 in our brain and body
3912.42 that are also related to
reward prediction error.
3915.436 But reward prediction error
is a very good system,
3920.197 or I should say, a lens
through which to think about,
3922.92 whether or not we should reward ourselves
3925.26 for performing a given habit.
3927.68 And this is a much larger discussion
3929.29 that actually relates
to things like parenting
3931.33 and self-regulation.
3932.72 You know, should we reward
kids just for effort?
3935.174 Should we reward
ourselves just for effort?
3937.86 What should we reward?
3938.78 How much should we reward ourselves?
3940.14 When should we withdraw reward?
3941.8 Should we use punishment?
3942.93 These kinds of things.
3943.763 This is a vast literature.
3944.776 We don't have time to
go into all the details,
3947.15 but the notion of reward
prediction error is so powerful
3951.246 that it can predict most
3953.41 if not all forms of learning,
including habit formation.
3956.63 And you can deploy or
use particular features
3959.53 of reward prediction error
3961.09 if you would like to reinforce
3963.28 or accelerate the formation
of certain habits.
3967.22 So, reward prediction
error, quite simply, is
3971.124 if you expect a reward
and the reward comes,
3975.137 a particular behavior that was associated
3978.01 with generating that reward is more likely
3980.35 to occur again.
3981.51 That's pretty straight forward.
3983.38 However, the amount of reward,
3986.68 in the form of this molecule dopamine,
3989.12 that you will experience is even greater
3991.96 if a reward arrives
that's unexpected. Okay.
3997.36 So let me repeat that again.
3998.84 If I think that something's
coming that's going to be great,
4003.532 let's say I lean into a habit,
4006.23 I manage to override my limbic friction,
4008.36 and I'm doing my 45 minutes
of writing in the morning
4011.27 with no phone and no internet
4012.77 and I'm getting toward the end,
4013.603 and I'm anticipating how
I'm actually doing this,
4015.283 this is great, I did it,
4016.59 I'm feeling really, really good.
4018.47 I finish, I definitely will
receive a dopamine reward,
4023.35 I'll make my own dopamine reward,
4024.61 that's where it comes from.
4025.443 Remember, this is all internal.
4027.069 However, I will also
receive a dopamine reward
4030.24 if unexpectedly something
positive happens.
4034.66 And typically if something unexpected
4037.68 but positive happens,
4039.05 the amount of dopamine reward
4040.67 that we get is actually much greater
4042.25 than in any other conditions.
4044.36 However, it's hard to surprise yourself
4046.59 about a behavior that you're
deliberately engaging in.
4049.16 So that becomes a bit of a tricky one.
4052.2 Reward prediction error also says
4054.38 that if we expect a reward
and the reward doesn't come
4059.8 that the pattern of dopamine release
4061.59 will follow a particular contour
4063.99 and that contour is very important.
4065.55 Here's how it goes.
4066.866 Let's say that I'm writing
4070.14 and I'm about 30 or 45 minutes in,
4072.72 I'm thinking, "Ah, this is great."
4074.638 "I'm actually, I managed to do this"
4076.073 "I'm succeeding in
executing the behaviors"
4078.657 "that I need to in order
to perform this habit."
4081.657 "I'm overriding limbic friction."
4083.696 Just that series of thoughts will start
4086.43 to generate the dopamine release
within my brain and body.
4089.72 However, if at the 15
minute mark the phone rings
4094.67 and I pick up the phone
4096.28 or I break my own protocol, I
break my own self-discipline
4100.38 and I go on and check social media
4102.64 or I do something that
takes me out of that,
4105.31 what's going to happen is
4107.32 that my level of dopamine
is actually going
4110.267 to drop below the baseline,
4111.84 meaning below the level of dopamine I had
4114.06 before I even started the
habit execution. Okay?
4118.23 So what this is, is this
system that predicts whether
4121.482 or not rewards are going to come.
4123.886 When we think a reward is going to come,
4126.57 it starts to actually arrive earlier
4128.68 in the form of dopamine release.
4130.04 This is the feeling
4131.56 that we experience as
positive anticipation.
4135.03 You tell a kid,
4135.863 "Hey, we're going to go
to the amusement park." Or
4137.527 "We're going to go get ice cream."
4139.02 They haven't had the ice cream yet,
4140.3 they're not at the amusement park,
4141.61 but they're excited, the
dopamine release comes earlier.
4144.58 Okay? They get to the amusement park
4146.07 or they get the ice cream,
4147.04 they will also have some dopamine release
4149.39 associated with that.
4150.443 But most of it, believe it or not,
4152.51 came in the form of the anticipation.
4154.53 And dopamine has some qualities
4155.93 that make the actual ice cream
4157.43 and the actual amusement park
experience more pleasurable
4160.44 than it would be had that
dopamine release not happened.
4164.04 Now of course, the other way
to do is to surprise a kid.
4166.1 You tell them,
4166.933 "Listen, we're going to the
class that you absolutely hate."
4170.3 Or "We're going to go see the person"
4171.767 "that you absolutely despise."
4173.14 And then you drive them
to the amusement park
4174.53 that's the big release of dopamine.
4177.1 But reward prediction error also says
4179.38 that if you tell the kid, or yourself,
4181.677 "Okay, we're headed to
the amusement park."
4183.027 "We're going to get some ice cream."
4184.32 They're really, really excited.
4185.33 And then you get there and it's closed,
4187.55 or they're not letting any more people in,
4189.34 well then the dopamine level
drops way below what it was
4192.4 before you told them that
you were headed there. Okay?
4194.53 I've given a number of different examples
4195.83 that hopefully make this clear.
4197.17 Reward prediction error
governs virtually all aspects
4200.805 of effort and all aspects of learning.
4204.19 Why? Because when dopamine
is released in the brain
4206.9 and body, the neural circuits
of our brain and body change.
4210.45 There's a state change.
4212.62 Our over level, excuse me,
our overall level of energy,
4216.44 but also the sorts of sensory events
4218.61 that we're paying attention to changes
4220.5 when there's a lot of
dopamine in our system.
4223.46 Now you can leverage
this for habit formation.
4226.79 Think back to task bracketing.
4228.835 Think back to limbic friction.
4231.515 If you are considering
adopting a new habit
4235.28 or if you are trying to break a habit,
4237.06 something we haven't
talked too much about,
4238.47 but we will in a moment, it's very useful
4241.97 to think not just about
the procedural aspects
4244.98 of what you're going to do,
4246.33 but also think about
the events that precede
4249.63 and follow that particular habit,
4252.95 and the execution, or at least the effort
4255.68 to execute that habit.
4257.385 What you're doing is you're
casting a kind of a spotlight
4260.63 around a bin of time, or a set of events,
4263.85 for which dopamine can be associated.
4266.03 What does this look like
in the practical sense?
4268.12 Well again,
4268.953 I'll just try and use very
simple concrete examples,
4271.09 but this could carry over to anything.
4272.74 Let's say I were somebody who
has a hard time getting in
4276.57 that 30 to 60 minutes
4278.3 of zone II cardiovascular
exercise mid-morning.
4281.65 This is actually an issue for me.
4282.96 I much prefer to do resistance exercise
4284.81 than cardiovascular exercise,
4286.07 although once I do it, I
always feel much better
4288.71 that I've done it.
4291.163 What I should do is positively
anticipate the onset
4297.0 and the offset of that session. Right?
4299.87 So thinking about leaning into the effort,
4303.137 going out and doing that
zone II cardio session,
4306.29 and I should think about
how I'm going to feel after.
4308.38 So, not just thinking about
4309.27 how great I'm going to feel after,
4311.901 but also thinking about
how hard it's going to be
4314.41 at the beginning,
4315.243 and then trying to reward
myself subjectively
4317.73 for the entire experience.
4319.06 In other words, start
rewarding task-bracketing
4321.84 in addition to rewarding the
execution of the habit itself.
4326.55 Now some of you might be saying,
4327.527 "Well, wait this is all self-talk."
4329.127 "This is just positive self-talk."
4330.7 But it's not positive self-talk,
it's not saying, you know,
4334.277 "I feel so great about doing something"
4335.817 "that I actually hate."
4336.65 You can't lie to yourself,
4337.59 or you're welcome to lie to yourself,
4339.08 but the neuroscience literature,
4340.63 the literature of growth mindset,
4342.12 all the literature basically of mindset
4344.08 speaks to the fact that
when you lie to yourself,
4346.17 you know you're lying,
4347.26 and you actually set up the
opposite of a reward system.
4350.38 So, you have to be brutally
honest with yourself
4352.298 that, for instance,
4353.798 "I don't like initiating
this cardiovascular exercise"
4357.137 "but I do like the fact that I've done it"
4358.737 "after I've done it."
4359.83 So what you are doing is
4361.04 you are applying reward prediction error
4363.172 to the entire sequence of things
4365.44 that's involved in getting
into the habit execution,
4368.695 getting through the habit execution,
4371.05 and getting out of the habit of execution.
4373.15 How do you do this?
4374.19 Well, I take us back
4375.53 to our procedural memory
visualization exercises
4379.14 we talked about earlier.
4380.33 When I talked about it in that context,
4382.07 I talked about walking through
mentally the series of steps
4385.92 that's required to perform
a particular habit.
4387.81 So in the case of the zone
II cardio thing it would be,
4390.437 "Okay up and put on my shoes,"
4391.527 "then I'm going to head out the door,"
4392.547 "then I'm going to drive up the road."
4393.89 There is a particular
canyon near here that,
4395.57 if I'm going to run,
4396.47 I happen to like running, or
I don't hate running enough
4399.25 that I tend to do it.
4400.56 Going through that, heading
back, et cetera, et cetera.
4403.31 That's great, but even better
4405.57 would be to broaden the time bin
4407.496 and start to positively
anticipate the period headed
4410.628 into the habit, so even
before you put on your shoes.
4415.06 The fact that you are
successfully placing the habit in,
4419.16 in this case, phase one of the day
4422.21 and that afterwards I'm going
4424.54 to feel a particular set
of positive benefits,
4426.93 elevated mood, et cetera.
4428.38 I like being hungry and quickly
after I exercise I'm hungry,
4431.0 so I like being hungry
because I like eating,
4432.83 so there's a whole set of things
4434.3 that link up with one another.
4435.88 So I'm not just thinking
about habit execution
4437.61 as this isolated little set of events,
4439.69 or this little time bin,
4441.27 but rather, I'm drawing a
larger envelope around it
4444.17 and starting to positively
associate dopamine reward
4446.7 with that larger envelope.
4448.69 And for those of you that are thinking,
4449.817 "Well, this is just a
psychological trick."
4451.61 You know, you're kind of like,
4453.363 "This is sort of like lying to yourself."
4454.48 It's not because you're not
actually contradicting the fact
4457.99 that some of this is unpleasant.
4459.8 What you're doing is
4460.633 you're taking this
entire series of events,
4462.36 what I'm calling this
kind of time envelope,
4463.97 and you're associating it
with a particular reward
4466.59 that comes later,
4467.423 which for me would be the
feeling that, you know,
4470.14 that I've completed this.
4471.21 Right? Because for me that's
usually a good feeling.
4473.26 So reward prediction error is beautiful,
4475.62 not just because it's a
sort of math of anticipation
4479.01 and reward, or a math of anticipation
4481.18 and disappointment,
4482.42 it's beautiful because you can stretch out
4485.43 or make more narrow the time bins
4487.64 in which reward prediction error works.
4490.12 Reward prediction error is the way
4491.69 in which people navigate
four year degrees.
4494.27 Right? I mean, you go, sure, final exam
4496.63 to final exam, et cetera.
4497.66 But ultimately, there's
a big payoff at the end
4499.53 and it's all basically
for that big payoff.
4502.052 And of course, I understand
that it's the journey,
4504.15 not the destination, but let's face it,
4505.75 for a lot of us goals
4507.16 and habits are about achieving
some sort of destination.
4510.29 In the case of zone II cardio,
4511.57 for me it's about trying to
stay alive for as long as I can,
4514.674 as long as I can with vitality, that is.
4517.61 And it's also the fact
that if I'm doing that,
4520.14 I get to eat the foods that I like.
4522.62 I tend to be able to eat more,
4523.95 which I happen to really enjoy eating,
4525.35 so much so that I'd like
it just as an activity.
4527.65 So basically what you're trying to do
4529.52 is not restrict your
thinking to just the habit
4532.28 that you're trying to form, but rather,
4534.07 to grab ahold of the timing before
4536.86 and after that particular habit
4538.87 and start to positively
associate reward mechanisms
4541.55 in your brain with that entire time bin.
4544.07 This is a very useful
and very powerful tool
4546.7 in order to form habits.
4548.36 And I should say that it's not something
4550.53 that comes naturally to most people.
4552.06 In fact, even as I describe it,
4553.52 you might find it's still
a little bit abstract,
4555.57 but what I encourage you to do,
4557.08 if you are finding it to
be a little bit vague,
4559.34 would be to pick the habit
that you want to form,
4561.405 write down or think about very concretely
4564.096 what is the sequence of steps involved
4566.27 in the execution of that habit,
4568.03 and then write down or think about
4570.07 what is the sequence of events
4571.62 that need to precede that habit,
4573.52 maybe the immediate 10
or 15 minutes before,
4576.11 as well as the immediate
sequence of events
4578.229 and/or feelings that will
occur after that habit,
4580.838 and then call the whole
thing a habit execution.
4584.87 The whole thing a effort to
engage in that particular habit.
4589.1 And in doing that, and
in positively associating
4592.07 with the idea that you're going
4593.47 to complete that entire sequence,
4595.44 you will engage reward prediction error
4597.52 in the proper way that the dopamine surge
4599.489 can lend itself towards motivation.
4601.91 Because ultimately, dopamine
is not about feeling good,
4605.5 it's about feeling motivated.
4606.96 This is something
4607.793 that I've talked about
numerous times before,
4609.41 but dopamine, contrary to popular belief,
4611.79 is not a reward molecule,
4613.522 so much as it is a molecule
of motivation and drive.
4617.016 And the natural consequence
4619.12 of doing the exercise I just described,
4621.27 of writing things out that precede,
4623.259 are involved in the immediate
execution of the habit,
4625.67 and follow the habit,
4626.902 will allow you to experience
an increase in energy
4631.09 and thereby an increase in likelihood
4633.49 that you're going to engage
4634.53 in that entire sequence of events.
4636.48 And the reason for that is
that dopamine gives us energy,
4638.607 and the reason for that is
that the molecule epinephrine,
4641.577 adrenaline, is actually
manufactured from dopamine.
4644.87 Biochemically, it comes from dopamine.
4647.07 So, dopamine is powerful
4648.73 and you can access more dopamine
4650.785 around even habits that
you haven't yet formed
4654.044 by taking this broader time envelope
4656.44 and task-bracketing that
specific task execution
4659.68 or habit execution.
4661.33 Way back at the beginning of the episode,
4663.02 In promised you that I
would deliver two programs
4665.603 that are geared towards habit formation.
4669.33 And I promised that I would give you ways
4671.37 in which you could gauge whether
4672.7 or not certain habits had
moved from high effort,
4676.051 what I call high limbic
friction, to reflexive.
4679.65 And we talked about a
number of way to gauge that.
4682.485 In researching this episode,
4684.048 I found a tremendous
number of different systems
4687.12 for habit formation.
4688.53 It's really amazing how much is out there.
4690.46 There, one says 60 days to this,
4692.24 or 21 days to that, or 18 days to this.
4694.6 I mean,
4695.597 it's just rampant in the
popular psychology literature
4697.947 and in the self-help literature.
4701.2 I want to spell out a particular system
4703.44 that I think could be very useful
4705.1 to most if not all people
4707.53 that's rooted in the
biology of habit formation,
4711.13 rooted in the psychology
of habit formation,
4713.21 and that is entirely
compatible with that phase one,
4715.78 phase two, phase three type program
4717.38 that I talked about earlier,
4719.0 but encompasses a bit
of a longer time scale
4721.802 and really arrives at a kind
of a system, if you will,
4725.698 for how to build in habits
4728.8 and then to test whether
or not those habits
4731.1 have really stuck
4732.45 and whether or not they're
likely to stick going forward.
4735.12 And so this, at least for
the sake of this example,
4738.46 a 21 day system.
4739.67 I picked 21 days because
that seems to be the average
4742.73 or most typical system for
engaging neuroplasticity
4746.427 as it relates to the
formation of new habits.
4748.9 This 21 day system, actually,
4750.33 is one that someone I know very well uses
4751.864 and has used for a very long time.
4753.563 They actually, their kids use it as well.
4756.2 And it has a certain elegance to it
4757.74 and I think as I describe it that elegance
4760.65 will begin to reveal itself.
4762.5 So basically what this
involves is you set out
4766.18 to perform 6 new habits per day
4770.242 across the course of 21 days.
4772.77 Why 6 and why 21?
4774.29 Well, we'll talk about that in a moment.
4776.11 But the idea is, you write down 6 things
4778.247 that you would like to
do every day for 21 days.
4781.336 What phase of the day
those things fall into?
4784.3 Well, that will depend on what they are
4785.81 and how they relate to
those earlier phase one,
4787.79 phase two, phase three, but for now,
4789.57 21 days, 6 things per day. However,
4791.598 the expectation is that
you'll only complete 4
4795.508 to 5 of those each day. Okay?
4798.53 So built into this is a
kind of permission to fail,
4801.57 but it's not failure,
4802.8 because it turns out that this approach
4806.5 to forming habits is based
4808.33 not so much on the specific habits
4810.77 that you're trying to form,
4812.25 but the habit of performing habits. Right?
4815.26 It's the habit of doing a
certain number of things per day.
4819.532 So, you set out to perform 6.
4821.76 Now, another reason for not
necessarily performing all 6 is
4824.87 that some activities probably
4826.57 shouldn't be performed each day.
4828.45 For instance, in my case,
if I were to weight train
4831.64 or even run every day, I'm of the sort,
4834.13 or my biology is of the sort
that I don't recover so well.
4837.55 So I wouldn't want to do
resistance training every day,
4840.18 but I might want to do it 4
days a week, for instance.
4842.075 So by having 6 things in that list,
4844.53 you could shuffle out
that particular activity
4847.3 on particular days of the week,
4848.57 and simply do 4 or 5 other activities.
4851.29 So 21 days, you list out 4 to 5 things.
4853.26 So it might be zone II
cardio, resistance training,
4855.66 sunlight viewing, writing
could be journaling,
4859.794 it could be learning a
language, mathematics.
4862.57 Again this is going to vary
4863.61 depending on your particular goal
4865.077 and the habits that
you're trying to create.
4866.937 But no more than six
4868.685 and the expectation is
4869.92 that you're not going to
perform more than 4 to 5.
4872.17 If you miss a day, meaning you
don't perform 4 to 5 things,
4876.56 there is no punishment.
4879.27 And in fact it's important
that you don't actually try
4883.2 and do what, in the literature,
4884.27 is called a habit slip compensation,
4886.49 which is just fancy psychological language
4889.09 for if you screw up and you
don't get all 4 or 5 in one day,
4894.17 you don't do 8 the next
day in order to compensate.
4897.275 This actually brings me
back to an example I had
4901.217 from graduate school.
4902.383 I remember when I started graduate school
4903.768 feeling very excited, but
a little bit overwhelmed
4905.49 by the amount of things that I had to do
4906.946 because I had to both do
research, I was doing coursework,
4909.83 at the time graduate students stipends,
4911.68 and still now unfortunately,
were depressingly low
4915.32 so it was financially stressful.
4916.62 There were a number of things happening
4918.03 and I remember a neurologist,
this was at UC Berkeley,
4921.106 he was a really fantastic
scientist and person,
4923.56 his name was Bob Knight,
some of you may know him.
4925.349 I remember he, I went to
him and I asked, you know,
4927.567 "What is the process by which someone"
4929.317 "actually navigates graduate
school successfully?"
4931.65 And he said, "Listen, you
don't want to do anything"
4935.927 "or engage in a routine in any way"
4938.567 "that you can't keep up consistently"
4940.237 "for at least five and
ideally 6 days per week."
4943.23 I thought, "Oh, that's pretty good."
4944.27 And he said, "Every 4 or 5 years"
4945.927 "you might have to update that,"
4946.957 "but you need to decide what
you can do consistently,"
4949.137 "what you can do every day
or at least six days a week,"
4951.907 "or 5 days a week."
4953.08 And that was very very useful to me
4955.11 and it fits well with this
notion of habit slips,
4957.89 that if you happen to screw
up and not be able to engage
4961.67 in whatever habits you're trying to learn
4963.79 for whatever reason, that the next day,
4965.48 you just get right back on on
the on the horse, so to speak.
4969.26 However, there's a really
interesting feature
4971.77 from the neuroscience literature
4973.62 and from the psychology that says
4975.44 that chunking this 21 days into 2 day bins
4978.94 can be very, very useful.
4980.9 While it is true that the unit of the day
4982.91 that our cells use is a
circadian one, a 24-hour clock,
4986.837 there does seem to be something powerful
4989.2 about engaging in particular habits,
4991.11 in a particular sequence,
for two days in a row,
4995.21 and then resetting, so thinking,
4996.697 "Okay I can do this for a day"
4998.727 "and if I can do it for a day,"
4999.627 "I can probably do it for 2 days."
5000.91 And then resetting. So every
2 days you're resetting.
5003.73 So you're kind of chunking 21 days
5006.21 into a series of 2 day bins,
in which you are trying
5008.171 to perform 4 to 5 new habits
5010.59 and then completing that 21 days.
5013.345 Now, everything I've described
about this 21-day program
5016.14 with 6 things that you're
trying to do with new habits
5018.69 and only performing 4 to 5 and
not compensating, et cetera.
5022.15 There's nothing neuroscientifically
unique about it,
5025.69 except for the fact that
it's not just 21 days,
5029.691 broken up into two day chunks.
5032.39 After 21 days, you stop engaging
5035.504 in this 21-day deliberate
4 to 5 things per day,
5040.05 tight schedule, and you
simply go into autopilot.
5044.1 You ask yourself how many
of those particular habits
5047.56 that I was deliberately trying to learn
5049.7 in the previous 21 days are
automatically incorporated
5053.76 into my schedule?
5054.593 How many of them am I naturally doing?
5056.71 In other words, every
21 days you don't update
5059.25 and start adding new habits.
5061.1 You simply try and maintain the ones
5062.89 that you built in that first 21 days.
5065.05 And this I think is extremely important
5067.2 because in all the habit
literature that I could find,
5070.213 sure, there was a lot
of psychological data
5073.27 and neuroscience data,
behavioral science data
5075.89 around here's how you form a habit,
5077.44 here's how you break a habit.
5078.93 There was even some
kind of test for whether
5081.61 or not a habit had really
achieved context independence,
5085.1 whether or not it was a
strongly formed habit.
5087.86 But there wasn't a lot of information,
5089.75 at least by my search,
5091.138 of what to do once you've formed a habit,
5093.622 and how to evaluate whether
5095.24 or not that habit is likely to
persist long into the future.
5099.426 So here's the idea, you
set out these 6 things
5104.26 that you would like to learn,
5105.71 or that you would like
to acquire in your life,
5107.68 these habits, you only expect
5110.212 that you're going to
perform 4 or 5 each day,
5111.72 you do that for 21 days.
5113.33 Again, if you miss a day,
5114.307 you just hop right back on the next day.
5116.03 However, you should think
about the functional units
5119.0 within this 21 day period as 2 days.
5121.923 You can try and nail 4 to 5
of these things for 2 days.
5125.41 If you happen to get all 6, great,
5126.96 but that's not necessarily required.
5129.15 So you can do it for 2
days then reset 2 days,
5131.06 then reset 2 days, and
then in the next 21 days,
5133.83 you're not trying to
acquire any new habits,
5135.81 you're not going to throw in 6 more habits
5138.01 that you want to learn,
you're simply going to assess
5140.222 how well, how deeply, you
rewired your nervous system
5143.492 to be able to perform those 6 habits
5146.223 of the previous 21 days.
5148.74 And this is extremely useful, I believe,
5150.73 because it will allow you to asses whether
5153.257 or not you can indeed make room,
5155.46 if you even have room, I
should say, for more habits.
5159.527 Many people are trying to
cram so many new behaviors
5162.35 into their nervous system,
that they don't stand a chance
5164.73 of learning all those behaviors.
5166.15 What you may find,
5167.09 is that you kept up 2 of
those things very consistently
5170.11 throughout the 21 days.
5171.29 And perhaps there was one of
them that you did sporadically,
5174.03 and that there were 3
others that, frankly,
5177.31 you didn't manage to execute.
5178.72 You may also be one of these
people, one of these mutants,
5181.905 that sets out to do 6 new
things per day for 21 days
5184.444 and performs every single one of them.
5186.474 Terrific. More power to you. In that case,
5188.483 for the following 21
days, let's see whether
5192.02 or not you can continue to
perform those very same 6 things
5194.94 every day for 21 days,
and then, and only then,
5197.111 would you want to add more habits in.
5200.853 So you could repeat this
21 day process, you know,
5203.54 21 days of new habit, 21 days
of testing those new habits
5206.9 as to whether or not
they're reflexive or not.
5208.29 You could do that forever, if you wanted.
5210.865 But the idea is that this isn't something
5212.89 that you're doing all year long.
5214.65 It's that you're perhaps
starting the new year
5216.84 or regardless of when
you're listening to this,
5218.74 you set out to make that 21
day really the stimulus period
5222.32 in which the habits get wired in
5224.24 and then the following month,
5225.46 and maybe even the following
months, or periods of 21 days,
5229.07 are really the kind of
thermometer or the test bed
5232.11 of how well you've embedded
those particular habits.
5235.56 And if indeed you want to
continue to add new habits
5238.58 or you find that certain
habits that you weren't able
5240.53 to embed in your nervous
system and make reflexive,
5242.81 you want to then bring
those in, fantastic.
5245.1 But it's only once you've
achieved all those 6 habits
5247.65 as reflexive, that you would move forward.
5249.43 And I think this sort of system,
5251.077 while it could have been replaced
5253.74 with many other different systems.
5255.7 Again, there's nothing
holy about this system.
5257.89 But this particular system
has a number of features,
5260.75 the lack of compensation for missed days,
5263.37 the fact that it's a fairly
high intensity program
5266.08 for 21 days, but then you test yourself,
5268.52 a kind of competition test
with yourself, if you will.
5270.889 Those features and the
fact that habit slips,
5274.443 missing of particular habits
5276.66 and not doing all 6 is kind
of built into the system,
5279.01 I think makes it a very reasonable one.
5281.24 It's very adaptable to the real world.
5284.0 And I think it's one that,
provided you obey the phase one,
5288.44 phase two, phase three type system
5290.08 that we talked about earlier,
5290.99 you collapse these two
programs with one another,
5293.46 which hopefully will be easy,
5294.65 based on the descriptions I've
given. Well, if you do that,
5297.267 and I think there's a
very high probability
5299.73 that the habits that you try and form
5301.15 will achieve this context dependence
5302.74 and that it will take
progressively less limbic friction
5305.31 to try and perform them.
5306.48 Thus far, we've almost
exclusively been discussing
5308.95 how to form habits.
5310.65 But what about breaking habits?
5312.37 Certainly many people out there
would like to break habits
5315.44 that they feel don't serve them well.
5317.662 One of the challenges
in breaking habits is
5320.02 that many habits occur very, very quickly
5323.16 and so there isn't an
opportunity to intervene
5324.883 until the habit has already been initiated
5327.778 and in some cases completed.
5330.49 Well, there are a couple of tools
5332.23 that neuroscience and psychology tell us
5334.86 can be very beneficial.
5336.61 Some of those things
are somewhat intuitive
5339.011 and relate to what I call
foundation practices.
5341.846 Meaning things that set the overall tone
5344.54 in your body and brain, such
that you would be less likely
5347.545 to engage in a particular habit
5349.763 or that would raise
your level of awareness,
5352.396 both of your situation and
to how you feel inside.
5356.57 So things like stress reduction.
5358.094 Things like getting good sleep.
5359.72 Things like quality nutrition.
5361.21 Things like having positive routines
5363.33 arranged throughout your day.
5364.78 All of those, of course, will support you
5367.033 in trying to break particular habits.
5369.73 And while that can be very useful,
5371.35 it's admittedly very generic advice.
5374.13 It doesn't point to any
one specific protocol.
5376.75 In order to identify a specific protocol
5379.77 that one could apply in
order to break habits,
5381.857 we have to look at the mirror image
5384.043 of the sort of neuroplasticity
5386.17 that we talked about at the
beginning of the episode.
5388.76 At the beginning of the episode,
5390.04 we talked about a form of neuroplasticity
5391.72 called long term potentiation,
5393.51 involving the NMDA receptor.
5395.606 Just to refresh your memory a little bit,
5397.354 it says that if a set of neurons
is very electrically active
5401.98 it's likely that those
neurons will communicate
5404.74 with themselves more easily
5406.154 because of changes in things
like NMDA receptor activity,
5410.32 the recruitment of additional
receptors, et cetera.
5412.33 It's essentially a cellular
and molecular explanation
5415.38 for how something goes from unlearned,
5418.53 to learned, to reflexive.
5420.98 Now, in order to break synapses,
5423.58 or to break apart neural connections
5425.62 that are serving a habit that
you don't want to engage in,
5428.551 we need to engage the process
called long term depression.
5432.53 And long term depression has nothing to do
5434.905 with a state of mental depression
or a reduction in mood.
5439.93 So I really want to be clear that
5441.51 when I say depression in this context
5443.89 it has nothing to do with
psychological depression,
5445.97 it has nothing to do with mood.
5447.91 It's simply called long term depression
5450.18 because just as long
term potentiation says
5452.93 if neuron A triggers
the firing of neuron B,
5455.85 and it does so very robustly
over and over and over again,
5459.03 then neuron A will not
have to fire as intensely,
5462.97 or as frequently, in
order to activate neuron B
5466.05 in the future because
they become potentiated.
5468.52 Right? The threshold for
co-activation has been reduced.
5471.7 There's a much higher probability
5472.99 that they will be activated together
5474.67 at low levels of intensity.
5476.574 That's essentially what
long term potentiation is.
5479.53 Long term depression says
that if neuron A is active
5483.28 and neuron B is not active
within a particular time window,
5487.558 then the connection between
neuron A and B will weaken
5491.29 over time, even if they started
off very strongly connected.
5495.51 Okay? So, I'm going to repeat that
5496.72 because this is a pretty detailed
neurobiological mechanism
5500.726 whereby if neuron A,
and neuron B is active,
5505.12 but at a different time
or outside a particular,
5507.781 what we call, temporal window,
5509.52 meaning outside a particular time window,
5512.04 then through long term depression,
5514.36 the connection between neuron
A and neuron B will weaken.
5518.24 And just as a point of interest,
5520.716 the NMDA receptor is also
involved in long term depression,
5524.36 although there are other
molecular components involved
5526.88 as well.
5527.713 So how do you take two neurons
5529.651 that underlie a habit out of synchrony?
5532.25 How do you get them to
fire asynchronously?
5534.153 This is pretty interesting
with respect to the cellular
5537.29 and molecular biology, but
at the behavioral level,
5539.74 it's especially interesting.
5540.683 They way that one would do this
is, let's say for instance,
5543.627 you have a habit of picking up
your phone mid work session.
5549.52 Okay? That's a reflexive habit I think
5551.84 that most people have experienced.
5553.553 And we often hear the idea that, oh,
5557.27 the phone is so filled
with access to dopamine
5560.0 and incredible things that
we're just drawn to it.
5562.62 But if you noticed what's
happened with phone use over time,
5565.895 most people, including
myself sometimes I admit,
5569.02 find ourselves just looking at our phone,
5570.82 or find ourselves in a particular app
5572.7 without actually having engaged
5574.21 in the conscious set of steps of,
5575.567 "Oh I'm really curious"
5576.557 "what's going on in this particular app."
5578.157 "I'm really curious"
5579.347 "what's going on in this
particular website."
5581.17 And you just kind of "find
yourself", in air quotes,
5583.91 for those of you listening,
I'm making air quotes.
5585.879 You just sort of find yourself
doing it because the behavior
5589.13 of picking up your phone
is sort of reflexive,
5590.97 or has become fully reflexive.
5593.12 You see this a lot at meals
5594.85 where multiple people are there
5596.48 and no one's looking at their phone
5597.87 and then all of a sudden
someone takes out their phone
5599.41 and you'll notice
5600.243 that other people just
naturally take out their phone.
5602.08 It's this kind observation induced reflex.
5606.39 And I would wager that most
people aren't consciously aware
5610.52 of the immediate steps involved.
5613.116 So the literature says
there are a number of ways
5616.04 to break these sorts
of habitual behaviors,
5618.573 or reflexive behaviors.
5620.98 Most of those approaches
involve establishing some sort
5624.75 of reward for not performing the activity
5627.748 or some sort of punishment
for forming the activity.
5630.94 I've heard of some basic things
that some people will do,
5633.1 like they'll even put like a
rubber band on their wrist,
5635.0 and every time they complain,
5636.44 or every time they do some behavior,
5638.91 like pick up their phone,
5639.95 they'll give themselves
a snap on the wrist.
5641.57 And yeah, the rationale
there is that you're trying
5643.86 to create a somatic, a very
physical representation
5647.0 of something that makes it very real
5649.88 and harder to overlook.
5651.21 Other people will just do a
tick mark on a piece of paper.
5653.47 This sort of, "What gets
measured is what gets managed"
5656.616 kind of mindset, where if
every time you do something,
5659.41 you take away the judgment,
this is very new age-y,
5662.73 I realize, but this is
what you find out there,
5665.0 if you search the literature.
5667.06 Even on PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
5669.84 that every time you engage in a behavior,
5671.76 you just measure the fact
that you did that behavior,
5674.93 you just mark it down.
5675.81 At the end of the day, people
are supposed to look at that
5677.75 and say, "Oh my goodness!"
5678.583 "I can't believe that I
spent, you know, 3 hours."
5681.922 Or, "I did it 46 times."
5683.456 And in fact, a lot of
apps, social media apps,
5686.117 will start to give you
warnings now, if you opt in,
5689.44 that you've been on the app for an hour,
5691.86 would you like to leave?
5692.693 Most people just click right
past it and go back in.
5694.258 I think very few people
say, "Oh my goodness!"
5697.337 "It's been an hour and
therefor you're right,"
5699.277 "I absolutely shouldn't
engage in this any more."
5701.53 It's just far to easy to just
blow past those reminders.
5704.092 Well, the literature on habit formation
5708.236 and habit reduction, breaking
habits, has been analyzed.
5712.54 There's a beautiful meta-analysis,
5714.992 which involves looking at a number
5716.76 of different studies all together,
5719.385 comparing the statistical
strength of each of those studies,
5722.19 looking in different conditions
5723.23 what sorts of habits were
trying to be made or broken.
5725.775 The first author on this
review is Fritz, F R I T Z.
5731.07 I'll certainly put a link to this.
5733.3 It's Heather Fritz and it's
5734.887 "Intervention to modify
habits: a scoping review."
5737.38 And it is indeed a very
broad scale review. It's from
5739.37 the Journal of Occupation
Participation and Health.
5741.5 It's published in 2020.
It's a really nice article.
5744.075 A couple of things I
learned from this article
5746.03 and then I'll get into the specific tool
5747.47 for breaking habits.
5748.75 Perhaps the most interesting
thing that I took
5750.49 from this review was the finding
5752.62 that notifications to
either engage in habits
5757.2 or to not engage in habits
5758.84 actually were not very
effective over time.
5761.61 They were effective in
the immediate period
5763.97 when people started using
these notifications,
5765.99 as were little sticky notes, like,
5767.797 "Don't go into the refrigerator"
5769.117 "between the hours of
whatever and whatever."
5771.32 Or just visual reminders,
5773.604 physical reminders or electronic reminders
5776.35 were effective in the immediate term,
5778.36 but in the long term,
did not predict whether
5780.24 or not people would effectively stick
5782.5 to habits they were trying to stick to,
5784.761 or break habits that they
were trying to break.
5785.97 So sadly, that doesn't
seem to work very well.
5788.98 And perhaps they just need to come up
5791.1 with more robust reminders.
5793.24 I don't know, mild electric shock
5794.56 or something like that
because what we do know,
5796.218 only sort of kidding
about mild electric shock,
5799.342 but what we do know from both human
5801.44 and animal studies is that
things like electric shock,
5804.81 things like monetary penalties, right?
5807.61 Having to pay out every time you engage
5809.34 in a particular behavior.
5810.5 Those are pretty effective
ways to break habits.
5812.776 The problems is when people
are not being monitored
5816.043 for habit use, for instance,
5819.5 you can imagine a situation where you say,
5821.237 "I'm not going to pick up my phone"
5822.507 "for the 4 hours in the
early part of the day"
5824.917 "so I can get, you know, real
dedicated focused work done."
5827.518 Unless someone's monitoring
them, then people don't tend
5830.224 to monitor themselves completely enough
5834.23 that they punish themselves
completely enough,
5836.16 that they break the behavior.
5837.07 In other words, the
punishment isn't bad enough,
5839.5 in order to break the habit,
5840.56 which just speaks to how
powerful these habits are
5843.78 once they become reflexive.
5844.95 They're just very, very hard to override.
5846.681 So it turns out that the key
5848.65 to generating long term
depression in these pathways
5852.118 is actually to take the period
5856.25 immediately following
the bad habit execution,
5859.64 meaning, let's say you tell yourself
5860.87 you're not going to pick up your phone,
5862.713 you're not going to bite your nails,
5863.924 you're not going to reflexively walk
5865.341 to the refrigerator at a
particular time or day,
5866.29 but you find yourself doing it anyway,
5868.45 and what actually has to happen
5870.55 is bringing conscious awareness
5872.75 to the period immediately afterwards,
5874.35 which I think most people recognize,
5875.84 they realize "Ugh I just did
it again. I just did it again."
5878.044 And in that moment, capture
the sequence of events,
5882.01 not that led to the bad habit execution,
5884.961 but actually to take advantage of the fact
5887.684 that the neurons that were responsible
5889.94 for generating that bad habit
were active a moment ago,
5893.454 and to actually engage
in a replacement behavior
5897.183 immediately afterward.
5899.43 Now, this is really interesting
and I think powerful
5901.52 because I would have thought
5902.73 that you have to engage
in a replacement behavior
5905.368 that truly replaces the
bad habit behavior, right?
5908.895 That you would have to be able
5910.7 to identify your state of mind
5913.08 or the sequence of events
leading into the bad habit,
5915.78 but rather, the stage
5917.58 or the period immediately
after the bad habit execution,
5920.22 is a unique opportunity to
insert a different type of,
5923.97 what we would call adaptive behavior,
5925.75 but that could be any
behavior that's not in line
5928.88 with the bad behavior, so
let's give it an example.
5931.82 Let's say you find yourself,
5933.2 you're trying to do focused
work, you pick up your phone,
5935.617 you're disappointed in yourself
for picking up your phone,
5938.856 you could of course just put it down,
5941.33 and re-engage in the work behavior,
5944.25 but if you were good at that,
5945.45 then you probably wouldn't have
done it in the first place.
5947.55 And so, what turns out
to be very effective,
5949.93 is to go engage in some
other positive habit.
5952.93 Now, this has two major effects.
5954.97 The first one is you start
5956.32 to link in time the
execution of a bad behavior
5959.52 to this other good behavior.
5961.404 And in doing so, you start to
recruit other neural circuits,
5965.829 other neurons, that can start
5968.34 to somewhat dismantle sequence of firing
5971.58 associated with the bad behavior.
5973.58 In other words, you start to
create a kind of a double habit
5976.88 that starts with a bad habit,
5978.43 and then ends with a good habit.
5980.35 And that seems to create
enough of a temporal mismatch
5983.492 so that then recognizing
5986.02 when you're heading toward to bad habit
5987.89 becomes more apparent to you.
5990.13 So again, I want to make
this very, very concrete.
5992.21 Let's say
5993.043 that the behavior is reflexively
picking up one's phone.
5995.96 You do that, you think, "Ugh,
goodness, I did it again."
5998.51 Here's what I'm going to do,
5999.63 you would set that down
6000.8 and then you would engage in
some other positive behavior,
6004.08 that you've deemed positive.
6005.26 And here, it's very
subjective, so it's hard
6006.95 for me to give an example
6007.88 that will necessarily
make sense to everybody,
6010.163 but perhaps you're working on hydration,
6012.7 so maybe you go have a glass of water.
6014.32 Maybe you're trying to do
breath work or something.
6018.91 Maybe you're trying to enhance
your language speaking skills
6023.19 so you go and you spend 5 minutes
6024.89 doing a particular type
of language learning.
6028.05 You literally exit whatever you were doing
6030.35 and perform that other new positive habit
6032.96 in the immediate period right after that,
6034.73 even for a short period of time.
6036.52 It's a little bit counterintuitive,
6038.17 but what this does it
creates kind of a cognitive
6040.569 and a temporal mismatch between
the initial bad behavior,
6045.04 which before is what we would
call sort of a closed loop,
6048.017 and the engineers out there will know
6049.53 what I'm talking about.
6051.425 But in a closed loop, so one behavior,
6053.044 one set of neural
firings, leads to another,
6055.059 leads to another,
6056.08 and then just kind of sets
the same thing in motion.
6058.11 It can be kind of a self
perpetuating system.
6060.71 By changing the number of
features that are in that loop,
6063.74 it disrupts the closed
nature of that loop,
6066.7 it creates what we call an open loop,
6068.49 and in an open loop, you are
better able to intervene.
6070.685 So, as I mentioned before, this
might seem counterintuitive,
6073.787 you might think,
6074.727 "Why would I want to reward
the execution of a bad habit"
6078.477 "with a good habit."
6079.787 "I don't want to reward
myself for the bad habit."
6082.13 But really what you're
trying to do is you're trying
6084.03 to change the nature
of the neural circuits
6086.6 that are firing so that
you can rewrite the script
6089.41 for that bad habit.
6091.442 A different way to put it would be,
6093.845 imagine that the bad habit
is like a chord on the piano
6098.67 that you play, or a chord notes,
6100.28 or a sequence of notes
that you would play,
6102.52 and it comes very easily.
6104.15 You can play it every single time.
6105.84 But, let's say,
6106.673 as you're trying to learn
a new piece of music,
6107.89 you're just constantly inserting that
6109.33 at the inappropriate time.
6110.48 That was, you know, I think
it was a decent enough analogy
6112.75 for a bad habit because it
involves some motor execution.
6115.64 You just find yourself doing it.
6117.28 Rather than trying to prevent
yourself from doing it,
6119.75 the next time you do
it, add in a new chord
6122.79 or sequence that you're trying to learn.
6125.7 What this does then is it
changes the whole nature
6128.3 of the sequence of neurons
that are firing from bad habit
6131.71 through to the end of this
newly applied good habit.
6135.47 So, this is the way in which
you start to dismantle or,
6139.57 when I say dismantle,
really weaken the likelihood
6142.73 that if neuron A fires,
neuron B will fire.
6145.1 Because, as you're
starting off in the mode
6148.11 of very reflexively
performing a bad habit,
6150.76 those neurons are firing together
6152.061 without you consciously being aware of it.
6154.69 It's almost impossible for
you to intervene in yourself
6158.098 without a number of other features,
6160.317 like severe punishment, severe
consequence type outcomes.
6164.284 Rather, tacking on some
additional sequences,
6168.02 like if neuron A, neuron B
fires, and then you're saying,
6171.397 "Okay well, if neuron B fires,"
6173.137 "I'm going to start inserting
neuron C, D, E, F to fire."
6177.36 Right? That's the, C, D, E,
F being the positive behavior
6180.89 that you're going to insert.
6182.03 And in doing so, you create a
chain of neuronal activation
6185.41 that then is very easy to dismantle.
6187.86 And so, when people have
applied this kind of approach,
6190.9 it removes the need to have
constant conscious awareness
6195.4 of one's own behavior
prior to that behavior,
6198.44 which is very, very difficult to achieve.
6200.94 Rather, what they find is
that they are able to engage
6204.45 in re-mapping of neural circuits
associated with bad habits
6207.72 in ways that are very,
very straightforward.
6210.59 Right? Because you can always identify
6212.54 when you've done the
thing you don't want to do
6214.17 and then tack on to that
something additional
6216.63 that's positive.
6217.69 Now, the nature of that
positive thing is important.
6220.69 You don't want it to be something
6221.75 that's very hard to execute.
6223.02 You want it to be
something that's positive
6224.61 and fairly easy to execute,
6226.39 so that you're not struggling all the time
6228.06 to insert this on top
of this bad behavior,
6230.711 whatever that bad behavior
might happen to be.
6233.52 But again,
6234.353 this is rooted in the biology
of long term depression,
6236.82 it maps very well to the
behavioral change literature
6239.287 that I was able to glean that really shows
6241.4 that rather than just get reminders,
6243.24 rather than try and instill punishment,
6244.9 rather than setting up reward
for breaking bad habits,
6247.75 that perhaps the simplest
way to approach this is
6250.054 to tack on additional
behaviors to the bad habits,
6253.6 make sure those behaviors
are good behaviors,
6255.99 or behaviors that are adaptive for you,
6258.35 and in doing so, you will soon find
6260.65 that the initiation of the bad habit
6262.47 takes on a whole new form
6263.61 or that you're not even
inspired to do it at all.
6266.097 And of course, I want to acknowledge
6267.65 that breaking bad habits is really hard.
6270.46 We had an episode all about addiction
6272.612 with Dr. Anna Lembke from
Stanford Medical School.
6276.09 She's a colleague of mine
6277.44 who runs the Dual-Diagnosis
Addiction Clinic at Stanford.
6280.48 And in that episode, we
talked a lot about how addicts
6283.594 for drugs, alcohol, people have addictions
6287.41 to certain types of behaviors,
or avoidance behaviors even,
6290.52 that in the case of addiction,
6291.8 there has to be a tremendous
kind of full-scale campaign
6295.067 for them to be able to
intervene in their behavior.
6297.53 So, for those of you
6298.363 that are thinking about bad habit breaking
6299.68 in the context of
addictive type behaviors,
6302.677 definitely check out that episode.
6304.762 Addiction does employ
some of these principles
6307.63 around habit making and
habit breaking, as it were,
6311.342 but of course, because the consequences
6314.511 of certain habits in
addiction can be so severe,
6317.736 there's other sets of protocols
6320.01 and there's a kind of a
psychological backdrop to it
6322.09 that's very important.
6323.17 It also relates to the
biology of dopamine,
6324.767 and you can find all
of that in the episode
6327.0 with Dr. Anna Lembke.
6328.47 So today we've covered
a lot about the biology
6331.31 and the psychology of habit formation
6333.41 and habit breaking.
6335.02 We talked about why certain
habits are so hard to wire in,
6340.27 why certain habits are
so hard to break down
6342.89 and eliminate, and how we can determine
6345.621 which habits are going to
be easier for us to access
6348.905 and which habits are going to be harder
6350.94 for us to access and break.
6353.45 We talked a lot about this
notion of limbic friction
6355.91 and we talked about context dependence.
6357.74 And we talked about a
number of different things
6360.96 as it relates to neural circuits
6362.58 and the formation of new
connections in the brain,
6365.02 and strengthening and weakening
of connections in the brain.
6367.426 We also discussed two programs.
6369.871 Programs designed specifically for you
6372.18 on the basis of the
neurobiology literature
6375.04 and the literature on the
psychology of habit formation
6377.41 and habit breaking.
6378.51 Just to briefly recap,
6380.307 one program involves
dividing the 24 hour day
6383.672 into three phases, phase
one, phase two, phase three,
6387.68 and to try and tackle specific habits
6389.873 at particular phases of the 24 hour cycle.
6393.075 The second program
involved a 21 day process
6396.976 of engaging approximately
6 new habits per day,
6401.72 although the expectation,
as I mentioned earlier,
6403.49 is that you're not going
to perform all 6 of those.
6406.14 And an assessment in the following 21 days
6408.66 as to whether or not you have
indeed formed those new habits
6411.75 or not.
6412.72 And there were a number of other features
6414.4 that I mentioned that were related
6415.71 to those two general programs.
6417.15 Phase one, phase two, phase
three, and the 21 day program,
6420.22 and how those could be meshed together.
6422.45 So, I'm guessing some of you
will probably have questions
6424.81 about those programs
and how to apply them,
6426.91 but hopefully they were clear
enough for you to get started.
6429.178 This is a good opportunity
for me to mention
6431.82 that the Huberman Lab Podcast
6433.72 has something called the
Neural Network Newsletter
6436.39 that is sent out
approximately once a month.
6439.198 For the next newsletter,
6440.832 I will release a on-paper
version of these two systems
6445.626 and how they mesh together
for habit formation
6448.06 and habit breaking, and if
you'd like to access that,
6451.36 you can go to hubermanlab.com,
you go to the menu,
6453.9 you can sign up for the newsletter.
6455.51 First of all, it's zero cost.
6457.6 Second of all, we have
our privacy policy there,
6460.01 but I can tell you right now,
6460.843 we don't share your email with any vendors
6462.97 or with any other sources.
6464.47 Those emails stay internal to us.
6466.245 And if you'd like to see
6468.04 what the sort of flavor
of those newsletters is,
6470.83 the previous newsletters, for instance,
6473.16 one on tools for sleep,
that I mentioned earlier,
6475.65 or tools for neuroplasticity,
in the classroom
6478.97 and outside the classroom as well,
6480.61 for teachers and for
students of various kinds,
6482.8 those are also posted there
6484.32 so you can access any of
the previous newsletters.
6487.1 My hope is that today you've learned
6488.61 both the biological mechanisms
6490.49 and the practical tools
by which you can start
6492.72 to establish habits that, for you,
6495.17 you deem adaptive, healthy,
6497.11 and that are going to
support you in your goals.
6498.93 And that you can start to
dismantle some of the habits
6501.87 that you find to be
unhealthy or maladaptive
6504.69 for you and for your goals.

6546.76 During today's podcast
6547.95 and in many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
6550.68 I mentioned supplements.
6551.767 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
6554.74 many people derive tremendous
benefit from supplements.
6557.042 Supplements for sleep,
supplements for focus,
6559.56 supplements for various other things
6560.96 related to mental and physical
health and performance.
6563.47 One key issue any time
there's a discussion
6566.03 about supplements, you have to be sure
6568.39 that the supplements you are taking
6570.09 are of the very highest quality.
6571.47 And for that reason, we've
partnered with Thorne,
6573.6 because Thorne has the
very highest stringency,
6575.75 with respect to the quality of
the ingredients they include,
6578.24 and the precision of the
amounts of the ingredients
6580.5 that they include in their supplements.
6582.56 If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,
6584.63 and get 20% off any of those supplements,
6586.87 you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman and,
6591.472 in addition to being able 20%
off any of those supplements,
6594.889 if you navigate deeper
into the Thorne site
6597.35 through that web portal,
thorne.com/u/huberman,
6600.7 you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements
6603.37 that Thorne makes.
6604.5 If you're not already
following us on Instagram
6606.49 and Twitter, please feel free to do so.
6608.639 There, I teach neuroscience
and neuroscience related tools
6611.791 in short format.
6613.288 Some of that material overlaps
6615.09 with what you hear on the podcast,
6616.37 some of it is unique and different
6617.85 from what's on the podcast.
6619.31 And once again,
6620.143 I want to thank you for
going on this journey
6622.57 of exploring the neuroscience
6624.504 and the psychology of habit
formation and habit breaking.
6628.14 I hope it supports you in your goals.
6629.62 And last but certainly not least,
6631.701 thank you for your interest in science.
