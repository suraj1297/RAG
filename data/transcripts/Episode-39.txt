0.32 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
1.85 where we discuss science
and science based tools
4.89 for everyday life.
7.056 [upbeat rock music]
9.31 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.25 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
12.93 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.89 Today, my guest is Dr. Paul Conti.
17.27 Dr. Conti is a psychiatrist
18.84 who did his training at
Stanford School of Medicine,
21.33 and then went on to be chief resident
22.97 at Harvard Medical School.
24.32 He now runs the Pacific Premier Group,
26.36 which is a collection of
psychiatrists and therapists
28.83 focusing on solving
complex human problems,
31.53 including trauma, addiction, personality,
34.04 and psychiatric disorders.
35.97 Today, we discuss trauma in detail
38.38 and the therapeutic process in detail.
40.91 For instance, we discuss what is trauma?
43.32 How do you know if you have trauma?
45.45 Dr. Conti shares with us, for instance,
47.34 that not every experience
that we think is traumatic
49.59 is necessarily traumatic
50.95 and yet many people might have trauma
53.35 without even realizing it.
54.81 We also talk about the
therapeutic process generally,
57.31 for instance, how to pick a therapist,
59.17 how to best approach
and go through therapy
61.5 and how to evaluate whether or not therapy
63.6 and your relationship to the
therapist is working or not.
66.46 We also talk about self
therapies because we acknowledge
69.12 that not everyone has access
to or can afford therapy.
72.63 And we talk about drug therapies,
74.9 for instance, antidepressants,
antipsychotics.
77.92 We talk about alcohol, cannabis,
80.5 ketamine and the psychedelics,
including psilocybin, LSD.
84.84 And we talk about the clinical use of MDMA
87.42 and what the future of that looks like.
89.21 The reason for bringing
Dr. Conti onto this podcast
91.68 is because I see him as the person
94.21 who has the greatest and most
holistic view of therapy,
98.26 trauma, drug therapies, talk therapies,
101.18 and how self therapy and work
with others can be integrated
104.52 for both healing and growing
from difficult circumstances.
107.86 Dr. Conti is also the author
of an exceptional book,
110.81 entitled "Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic,
113.52 How trauma works and how
we can heal from it."
116.46 That book describes trauma
117.93 and its many features and many tools,
120.74 some of which we discuss
on the podcast today.
123.33 So whether or not you have trauma or not,
126.11 by the end of today's episode,
127.35 you will have a much deeper understanding
129.17 about what trauma is.
130.75 In fact, I'm confident
that you will gain insight
132.77 into whether or not
you have trauma or not,
135.01 whether or not people close
to you have trauma or not
137.29 and the various paths to
recovering and indeed growing
140.13 from trauma that we can all take.
142.39 As you'll soon learn Dr. Conti
143.91 is an exceptional communicator
and has a unique window
147.49 into the trauma and therapeutic process
149.74 that I know that all
of us can benefit from.
152.21 Before we begin,
153.043 I'd like to emphasize that
this podcast is separate
155.27 from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.
157.5 It is however,
158.333 part of my desire and
effort to bring zero cost
160.36 to consumer information about science
161.96 and science related tools
to the general public.
164.69 In keeping with that theme,
165.83 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
168.55 Our first sponsor is ROKA.
170.44 ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
172.39 that are of the absolute highest quality.
174.69 The company was founded by
two all American swimmers
176.82 from Stanford and everything about ROKA
179.19 eyeglasses and sunglasses
180.62 was designed with performance in mind.
182.93 I spent a lifetime working
on the visual system
184.83 and I can tell you that our
visual system has to contend
186.75 with a lot of different challenges.
188.38 For instance, when you
move from a shady area
190.5 to a brightly lit area,
192.09 your eyes in your brain
have to adjust in order
194.0 for you to be able to see clearly.
195.64 ROKA, eyeglasses and sunglasses
197.14 were designed with the biology
of the visual system in mind.
200.06 So you never notice those transitions.
201.73 They're very seamless.
202.69 You always see things
with perfect clarity.
205.04 The other terrific thing about ROKA
206.24 eyeglasses and sunglasses is
they are extremely lightweight.
209.08 Most of the time,
209.913 I can't even remember
that I'm wearing them.
211.35 I wear readers at night
and I wear sunglasses
213.53 sometimes in the daytime
214.71 when it is very brighter
or I'm driving and so on.
217.33 If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses or sunglasses,

225.14 on your first order.
226.07 Again, that's roka.com
227.93 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
230.1 Today's podcast is also brought
to us by inside tracker.
233.06 Inside tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
235.41 that analyzes data from your blood
237.24 and DNA to help you better
238.48 understand your body and help
you reach your health goals.
241.43 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
244.3 for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact
247.69 our immediate and long-term health
249.42 can only be measured and assessed
with a quality blood test.
252.44 And nowadays with the
advent of modern DNA tests,
255.15 we can also get insight
into, for instance,
257.21 our biological age and
see how that compares
259.53 to our chronological age.
261.09 And of course,
262.36 despite what our birthday
cake screams back at us,
264.92 it is our biological
age that really matters.
268.93 If you're going to get blood
tests or DNA tests, however,
271.28 you need to be able to interpret the data.
272.76 And that's really where
inside tracker stands apart.
275.93 A lot of companies will give
you a DNA test or a blood test.
279.7 They'll send you values of
hormones, metabolic markers,
282.47 etcetera, but you don't know
what to do with those data.
284.7 InsideTrackeris a very
easy to use platform.
287.93 So when you get the numbers back,
289.87 you can click on any of the
numbers that either are in range
293.0 or out range, too low, too high, etcetera,
295.27 and it will direct you towards
specific behavioral tools,
298.19 so lifestyle factors, nutritional tools,
300.45 supplement tools, etcetera,
301.71 that can help you bring those numbers
303.13 into the ranges that are best for you,
305.0 which is really an exceptional
tool that makes all the blood
308.1 tests and DNA tests really
exceptionally powerful.

322.3 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Blinkist.
325.17 Blinkist is an app that has
thousands of non-fiction books
328.23 condensed down to just 15 minutes each
330.28 of key takeaways that you
can read or listen to,
332.46 to extract the most important
knowledge from those books.
335.54 I love reading physical books,
337.3 literally physical hard copies of books.
339.02 And I like listening to audio books.
341.04 However, I also like to revisit books
342.67 that I've read or listened to,
344.1 and sometimes I just want
to get the key points
346.19 or the key takeaways from a book
347.63 that I've never read or listened to.
349.64 Blinkist is terrific for all of that.
351.96 For instance, when researching
our episodes on sleep,
355.19 one of the books that I
read and found very valuable
357.62 is Matt Walker, professor
at UC Berkeley's book,
360.937 "Why We Sleep,"
362.13 I've read that book,
363.07 but then I wanted to also make sure
364.64 that I hit the key takeaways.
366.31 Blinkist was essential for that.
368.67 Other books that I've read
369.67 before and that I own and enjoy,
371.67 but I listened to the Blinkist
version of from time to time
374.38 are things like Tim
Ferris's "The 4-Hour Body"
377.04 or Tim Ferris's The 4-Hour Chef book,
380.2 both of which are excellent
381.32 or Nassim Taleb's "The Black Swan"
383.69 and there are many other titles as well.
385.61 Blinkist is also a great way
386.7 to finally get through many of the books
388.12 that you've been meaning to read,
389.48 but haven't had time for.
391.15 With Blinkist, you get
unlimited access to reader
393.36 or listen to a massive library
394.98 of condensed non-fiction books.
396.87 Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
398.82 just for our Huberman
lab podcast audience.
401.63 If you go to blinkist.com/huberman,
404.03 you can get a free seven day trial

416.38 and a seven day free trial.
419.073 And now for my discussion
with Dr. Paul Conti.
421.83 Paul, thank you so much
for being here today.
423.92 - Thank you so much for having me.
425.55 - I've been looking forward to this
427.59 and I've received a ton
of questions about trauma,
432.24 about therapy,
433.77 about how to assess
where one is in their own
436.71 arc of problems and addressing
440.33 familial issues and relationship
issues and so forth.
444.61 If we could just start off very basic
446.07 and just get everyone oriented.
447.71 - Sure.
448.543 - How should we define trauma?
451.18 We all have hard experiences.
453.35 Some of them, we might
ruminate on more than others,
456.77 but what is trauma?
460.26 - To make the definition relevant,
462.924 I think we have to look at
trauma as not anything negative
466.2 that happens to us, right?
467.68 But something that
overwhelms our coping skills,
471.0 then leaves us different
as we move forward.
474.21 So it changes the way that
our brains function, right?
477.78 And then that changes evident in us
479.81 as we move forward through life.
482.83 - So how do we know if
we have trauma or not?
484.9 I've heard before everyone has trauma.
487.473 For instance, I've heard
490.101 that if we are a child
or when we are a child
493.08 and we request love from
a parent or attention
495.77 from a parent,
496.92 if they dismiss us that
that's a microtrauma,
501.21 is that overstating or unfair
to the real issue of trauma?
506.4 Do we all have trauma?
507.9 What are micro traumas?
509.14 What are macro traumas?
510.52 - Right, I think traumas
513.1 that we might categorize
as disappointments, right?
516.726 Or things that are are negative,
518.24 but not deeply impactful,
520.2 I think is not a helpful
definition, right?
523.123 I think the helpful definition
is something that rises
526.01 to the magnitude of really
changing us and something
529.21 that we can see both in how we behave.
532.37 We can see it in mood,
533.39 anxiety, behavior, sleep, physical health.
536.35 So we can identify it
538.13 and we can also see it in brain changes.
541.992 So the fact that we become,
542.825 say more hypervigilant, right?
543.8 More vigilant,
544.633 and then we can see that
different parts of the brain
547.28 are more active.
548.72 So that definition,
551.75 that definition captures how trauma,
554.59 if it rises to a certain
level, like what we would say,
557.3 trauma that makes a post
trauma syndrome, right?
560.1 Leaves us different,
561.84 I think is the helpful
definition of trauma
563.93 because it's a clinical definition, right?
565.86 It's changes in us as people
568.968 and we can map those changes
571.698 to identifiable shifts
in our brain function.
574.82 - So how do we know if we've
been changed by something?
579.27 I mean, I can think
back to childhood events
583.233 where some kid on the playground
584.66 or in the classroom said something,
586.93 I didn't like, something
negative about me.
588.8 I think most people can do that.
590.03 We have a great memory for the kid
592.92 that said something awful,
594.06 or the parent or teacher
that said something awful
596.08 that really felt like it hurt
us or at least stuck with us.
599.47 So clearly one's brain,
602.19 my brain in this example has been changed
604.26 by that event such that I remember it,
608.01 but how do we know if something
609.34 has actually changed the way that we are?
611.54 Because of course we don't
know how we would be otherwise.
614.57 - Right, right.
616.17 - That's difficult, right.
618.47 It's doable, but it's
difficult because the response,
622.06 so if the trauma rises to the
level of changing our brains
625.25 and I don't just mean, like
we have a new memory, right?
627.64 So we can have memories
628.57 of something that was negative, right?
630.25 And in that sense,
631.083 it changes the brain because
632.51 now there's something we can call to mind,
634.57 but it doesn't change the
functioning of the brain, right?
638.05 If trauma rises to the level
639.92 of changing the functioning of our brains,
642.81 then there's almost always
a reflex of guilt and shame
646.92 around the trauma that can lead us
650.419 and often leads us to bury,
right, to avoid it, right?
654.36 To feel that now there's
something negative inside of me
658.632 and it feels shameful
660.01 or it feels like no one
else would accept it, right?
664.691 So, what happens is people tend to avoid
666.5 looking at the change in them,
669.08 which is exactly the opposite
670.54 of what needs to be done, right?
671.76 The idea of in a viral pandemic, right?
673.97 We want to stay away from one
another and isolate, right?
676.69 But with the trauma epidemic we need,
680.33 we need to communicate with other people.
682.12 We need to communicate and
put words to what's going on
684.83 inside of us.
685.663 And very often a, a person knows, I mean,
688.88 I've done so much clinical
work over about 20 years,
692.9 that has focused on trauma.
694.83 And a lot of the times
the person knows, right?
698.24 But they're not admitting to themselves
700.07 because they're afraid of it, right?
701.23 They don't know what to do,
but if they start talking,
704.5 then they'll talk about
the event or the situation.
708.24 It could be something acute,
709.41 or it could be something chronic,
711.12 that really has been
harmful to them, right?
713.744 And then they feel different afterwards.
715.34 Like, oh, after that,
716.53 I started thinking differently,
feeling differently,
719.07 but that doesn't always happen.
720.41 Sometimes it's a process of exploration
723.55 through dialogue, right?
725.1 Whether it's written
or whether it's spoken
728.03 of the person,
729.32 so of exploring the changes
inside of themselves,
732.04 maybe changes to their self-talk inside,
734.44 changes to their thoughts about the world
736.26 and whether they can navigate
737.83 safely and readily in it.
739.75 And you know, it anchors
as I talk about this,
742.18 the example I'll use at times
is the example of my own life,
745.99 where, you know, when I was much younger
748.53 in my early twenties,
749.87 my younger brother took
his life by suicide.
753.2 And the response of guilt and shame
756.82 and hiding all of it inside of me was,
761.08 it's very dramatic,
764.591 but I wasn't acknowledging it, right?
766.33 'Cause I didn't know what to do about it.
767.76 And I felt guilty and I felt
responsible and I felt ashamed.
771.64 So there was an avoidance inside of me.
775.047 And then I wasn't saying to
myself, hey, before this,
777.053 like you thought that
you could be effective
779.78 and you could make your way in the world.
781.306 And you know, if you were a
good person and you worked hard,
782.85 you could make a difference, right?
784.46 And then afterwards, I
thought, I can't get anywhere.
787.85 The world's against me.
789.826 And I felt like, oh my,
my options are all gone.
792.48 And you know,
793.467 I was like 24 years old, right?
794.5 So, I didn't see that
the change was in me,
797.98 but I was taking care of myself poorly.
800.39 Like there was enough
going on that was unhealthy
802.9 that I couldn't avoid the
realization that like, hey,
805.28 I'm different now and in
these ways that are automatic.
809.14 My reflex to, can I make
my way in the world?
811.87 Can I have a good life?
812.91 Can I be happy?
813.8 My reflex is to that we're all different.
816.25 And they were coming through
the lens of heightened anxiety,
819.24 heightened vigilance, a sense of guilt,
821.13 a sense of shame and a
sense of non belonging
824.62 in the world
825.47 and was ultimately good and
helpful people around me
829.44 and my own realization.
830.69 And hey, things are not going well, right?
832.5 That led me to then get some help
834.45 and to be able to talk about it
835.93 and realize like, oh my gosh,
837.31 I need to face these things
838.78 that are going on inside of me.
842.403 - From a psychoanalytic psychological,
844.48 and maybe even a neuroscience
perspective, two questions.
848.31 Why do you think that
when we experience trauma,
854.342 these things that we call
guilt and shame surface?
857.95 Everything you're telling
me is that in the end,
860.56 that's not adaptive.
862.02 - Hmm.
862.853 - [Paul] Why would we be built that way?
865.353 - Right, right.
866.922 - So that's the first question.
868.686 And then the second question is,
870.49 how should we conceptualize
guilt and shame?
875.38 I think that we hear guilt.
876.52 We hear shame.
878.55 How should we think about it?
880.569 I mean, those emotions must
exist in us for some reason,
885.91 but in this case, it seems like they,
887.24 they don't serve us well.
888.3 So maybe it that order
or in reverse order,
893.29 what is guilt, really?
894.59 What is shame really?
897.439 And why is it that we seem
to be reflexively wired
899.76 to feel guilty and feel
ashamed when that's the exact
904.37 opposite of what we need to
do in the case of trauma?
906.87 - Right, right.
908.317 No, I think these are great questions.
909.15 And I don't think anyone
knows the answers for sure.
912.21 But my read of all of that
is that there's something
916.03 adaptive that has happened in us
918.66 through evolution that
now becomes maladaptive
922.8 in the way we live in
the modern world, right?
925.43 So if you think of through
most of human development,
927.97 people weren't living that long, right?
929.49 And the idea was to survive and reproduce.
933.82 So, traumatic things that happened to us,
935.53 it would make sense for
them to stay with us, right?
939.32 So if you ate a new food and got really,
941.36 really sick, you better
remember that, right?
944.82 If you see someone from
the group of people,
947.73 a couple miles away, right?
949.974 And one of those people
attacks you, right?
951.815 It's like, you better remember that.
954.407 So, the traumatic things
956.238 that are sort of emblazoned in our brain
957.97 are built to last, right?
959.7 Things that are positive will generate
961.73 some emotion inside of us,
963.23 but things that are profoundly negative
965.37 are much more likely to stay with us.
967.67 And I think that that was adaptive, right?
970.19 When all of that was
about survival, right?
972.98 And I think the same thing is
true with say shame, right?
978.508 So I think here, it makes
sense to talk a little bit
981.11 and actually I'm interested
your thoughts about this, right?
983.498 That the limbic system, right?
985.71 So the system often is called
the emotion system, right?
988.55 In our brains has actually of course
991.27 varying function, right?
992.5 And one aspect is affect, right?
995.48 So affect is aroused in us,
998.27 which I think the meaning then
1000.25 is it's created in us
without our choice, right?
1005.251 So if we're walking down the road
1007.023 and someone jumps in front
of us or pushes us, right?
1009.2 Then there's a response
of fear, anger, right?
1012.24 Heart starts beating faster,
1014.13 more blood to the muscles,
1016.64 we're getting ready to fight, right?
1018.72 Or run, right?
1019.93 And then we become aware of it, right?
1022.83 So, the aroused affect in
us is also about survival
1027.54 and it has a very deep impact upon us
1030.907 and shame is an aroused affect.
1033.87 So it can be raised in
us without our choice
1036.41 and it's very powerful,
1037.93 which if you think about that
1040.367 is an extremely strong deterrent, right?
1042.15 So if you had, you know,
1043.52 imagine a tribe or a
group of people, right?
1045.89 That are sheltered
together, and, you know,
1048.92 someone eats half the food
at night or something, right?
1052.501 And like there's a very
negative response, right?
1054.717 And that person feels shame
because shame is so powerful
1058.38 to control behavior, right?
1060.3 So the way that trauma
can change our brains
1063.82 and stay with us in a way
that says, be more vigilant,
1067.6 look at the world in a different way,
1069.42 act more defensively, right?
1072.756 And how that links to shame and to guilt,
1074.98 and then guilt in,
1076.43 guilt becomes what gets
called feeling technically
1079.7 where we relate the aroused
affect to ourselves, right?
1085.013 So, shame the aroused affect and guilt,
1087.01 the next step, right?
1088.65 When the shame gets related
to self are such profound
1091.827 behavioral interventions
and deterrents, right?
1095.984 That you can see,
1096.817 I think how evolutionarily
kind of all makes sense
1099.64 if we're fighting for survival
1101.63 and we're an elder statesman
if we make it to 20, right?
1104.79 This makes sense.
1106.02 But it doesn't make sense in a world
1108.46 where we live much longer, right?
1110.53 We navigate in all
sorts of different ways.
1113.04 And there's so much coming at
us that can be traumatizing.
1116.17 I mean, if you think
about the news, right?
1118.237 I mean, how many times have
I written a prescription
1120.02 for someone that says no more news, right?
1122.757 - You've actually written
those prescriptions?
1124.37 - Oh, yes, yes.
1125.84 So glance at the news,
look at the news for news,
1128.9 anything going on I need to know, right?
1130.82 But what are people doing is looking at it
1133.577 and they're clicking and they're clicking.
1135.06 And there's a sense of
being like enthralled
1138.57 in a very frightening way with the horrors
1141.73 that are in front of us.
1144.926 And it shows how yes,
1145.759 trauma can come through acute
things that happen to us.
1148.87 Trauma can come through chronic
things, chronic denigration,
1151.68 whether it's based upon
socioeconomic status,
1154.45 immigration status,
1158.05 race, religion, sexuality,
1160.16 gender identity, these
chronic traumas, right?
1164.12 Of being denigrated by
the society around us,
1167.22 or treated as less than
can change the brain.
1169.56 But vicarious experiences can too, right?
1172.61 And we know this is not theoretical.
1174.57 We know that the changes in the brain
1177.11 can come from vicarious experiences too,
1179.55 which is why people who
are glued to the news
1181.79 and then feeling like, oh my goodness,
1183.27 like what is happening?
1184.75 The mothers in the Ukraine who've
1187.07 lost babies in the war.
1188.237 And like, there are things
that are so terrifying
1191.665 that if we spend so much time with that,
1193.4 it has a similar effect.
1194.7 So our brains are built
to change from trauma,
1199.36 but not in the way we experience trauma
1202.097 and not in the way that we live life
1204.21 in terms of the nature of living life
1206.417 and the duration of life
in the modern world,
1208.26 where these traumas that happen to us
1210.92 are often so bad for us
1213.08 because they change how
our brain is functioning.
1215.63 And then our entire orientation
1217.37 to the world is different
1218.88 and that could be for,
1220.74 years and years and decades and decades.
1223.56 It brings so much misery and suffering
1226.14 and at times it brings death.
1227.96 If you think about a hundred
thousand overdose deaths
1231.38 in this country in a year, 100,000,
1234.477 I mean where is a,
1236.49 so much of that arising from
is a person who's treated
1239.97 addiction very intensively
over many years.
1243.0 I think that, well,
1244.05 I feel sure that the majority of addiction
1246.91 that I see and treat arises,
1250.24 ultimately the roots of it are
in trauma and are in trying
1254.11 to soothe something that's
stuck inside that the person
1256.7 isn't letting outside because
of the guilt and shame,
1258.85 but it's running around in their head
1260.42 and tormented by it.
1262.19 And now there's a pool for,
1264.18 for these drugs or sometimes
medicines to soothe.
1267.425 So, the opiates
1268.46 that were given after
a minor surgery, right?
1271.01 Are like, okay, yeah,
1271.9 they help the pain for the minor surgery,
1273.55 but what they're really helping
is the pain inside, right?
1276.7 But that very quickly turns
into addiction, danger, risk.
1280.75 And we see that over and over again
1284.04 and not in a theoretical way.
1285.78 Like I see that in people
who have been in my practice
1289.22 with addiction, arising from trauma
1291.88 who have subsequently died.
1293.58 So it's sort of, writ
large in our existence,
1296.92 in the modern world.
1298.52 - Incredible to me that
this is the way it works.
1303.369 What I mean by that is
1305.8 this idea that I've heard about before.
1307.9 I think it was a Freudian concept
1310.785 of a repetition compulsion.
1311.618 - Yes.
1313.115 - That this is what boggles my mind,
1315.14 as I'm hearing this,
1316.68 something happens to us or we
observe something traumatic.
1320.78 And instead of acknowledging that
1323.037 and trying to distance from it,
1324.8 there seems to be a
reflex of shame and guilt
1328.36 in many cases and stuffing it away
1331.16 and then a repetition of behaviors
1334.12 to continue to try and just stuff it away.
1336.836 - [Paul] Yes.
1337.669 - Like you're trying
to pack, I don't know,
1338.83 recently I was packing a home
and trying to get a sleeping
1341.065 bag back into the bag.
1343.09 it seems like it's always
trying mushroom out the top,
1345.94 this kind of thing.
1346.773 It takes a lot of ongoing effort.
1348.65 And at the same time that
if this thing really exists,
1352.49 this repetition compulsion,
1354.15 people will return over and over again
1356.904 to the kinds of scenarios
or at least the kinds
1358.45 of emotional states that
look just like the trauma.
1360.742 - [Paul] Yes.
1361.575 - Or resemble it in some way.
1363.889 So the question I have for you is,
1365.37 is the repetition compulsion a real thing?
1368.87 And why would we be wired that way?
1372.41 My understanding of this
concept of the repetition
1374.81 compulsion is that we all
want to solve our traumas.
1378.68 - [Paul] Yes.
1379.724 - And it allows us to put
ourselves into micro or again,
1383.28 macro versions of that
over and over again.
1385.99 We get to run the
experiment again and again.
1388.142 - Right.
1388.975 - In an attempt to solve it.
1389.808 - Right.
1390.641 - In the case of taking a drug
1391.474 that it's clear certain
drugs like opioids,
1394.23 it's clear how that would not allow us,
1396.16 to deal with it, right?
1397.567 - [Paul] Yeah.
1398.4 - It's just masking the emotional state.
1400.24 But why is it for instance that somebody
1402.74 who experiences sexual trauma,
1404.24 then places themselves into circumstances
1406.62 of more sexual trauma?
1409.01 Why is it that somebody who
is in an abusive relationship
1411.39 goes on to have a second and
third or fourth verbally,
1414.33 or physically abusive relationship?
1416.3 Yeah, I mean, on the
face of it, you just go,
1417.64 that makes no sense.
1418.85 And yet we see this over
and over and over again.
1422.53 - Yes, the first thing I would say
1425.33 about the validity of the repetition
1426.37 compulsion concept, right?
1430.279 Is a strong yes.
1431.12 Like, yes, we see that over and over.
1433.57 It's not necessarily in everyone, but boy,
1436.25 it is in a lot of people
who have suffered trauma.
1440.36 And I think there's a very
good reason on the face,
1443.72 on the surface of it, it's
like, it makes no sense.
1446.3 But then if we think,
well, how does the brain,
1448.67 how does our brains
actually function, right?
1452.806 We're sort of trained at
least in Western society,
1454.67 I think, to think of ourselves
as logical creatures, right?
1457.623 That like, oh, we're logical.
1459.26 And ultimately everything in
us can just boil down to logic.
1462.01 And if we think about it enough,
1464.703 we're going to understand how
to make the right decisions,
1467.17 which is completely not true, right?
1470.11 The limbic system, right?
1471.58 The emotion system so
to speak inside of us
1475.881 always Trump's logic, right?
1477.09 If you think about,
1478.631 does it ever make sense to
run into a burning building?
1480.58 I mean, logic says no, right?
1482.6 But if someone you love is
in the burning building,
1485.33 people run right in, right?
1487.886 Because the limbic system says, yes.
1489.22 So when logic and emotion
come head to head,
1492.55 emotion wins all the time.
1494.13 If emotion is powerful enough,
1495.82 it will always win.
1498.795 And so the limbic system is
so important and the limbic
1501.5 system does not care about the
clock or the calendar, right?
1506.41 And that's the answer.
1507.56 And also, say why
1509.682 to the repetition compulsion.
1510.515 So the limbic system doesn't know like,
1512.63 oh, it's now, it's today.
1515.017 It's may, it's 2022.
1516.538 It just doesn't care at all, right?
1519.562 So how I would relate that
to the repetition compulsion
1523.034 is when people are repeating,
1523.99 what they're trying to do is
to make things right, right?
1528.1 With the idea that if we
can repeat the situation
1531.26 and make it right, it will
fix everything, right?
1534.77 Which makes perfect sense if we think,
1538.31 well, where is that
concept coming from, right?
1540.77 It's coming from the
emotional part of the brain
1543.61 that wants relief from
suffering of the trauma
1546.58 and does not understand
the clock or the calendar.
1549.82 So if I can solve something now,
1552.18 I will also solve something
in the past, right?
1555.13 Which is why I can't
tell you how many times
1557.54 I've sat with someone and say,
1558.94 we're starting to do therapy, right?
1561.06 And a person will say, oh
gosh, like I know, look,
1564.79 you just can't help me, right?
1565.97 I mean, you know,
1567.34 my last seven relationships
have been abusive, right?
1570.59 And I'll say back something
sometimes like, well,
1573.94 if you tell me that you've
had seven relationships
1576.343 that have been abusive in different ways,
1578.89 I'll agree with you.
1579.723 Like, I only say that,
1580.56 'cause that's never what
someone says, right?
1583.12 But I think what you're going
to tell me is you've kind of had
1585.97 the same relationship seven times.
1588.35 It's not seven things, it's one, right?
1590.82 And that's always, I
don't think one time yet
1594.398 that has failed to be the case.
1595.89 And that's how, so if you think about it,
1599.221 that's how we start to
elucidate what's going on.
1601.22 So they make the light bulb that goes off.
1603.22 Like I have not had seven
different abusive relationships.
1607.08 I have had one that I
have repeated seven times
1610.25 and now we start getting
to what's really going on
1612.647 and what needs to happen,
1613.9 that person needs to face
what happened in that original
1617.109 abusive relationship
1618.69 and it always comes down to
the same sort of concepts,
1623.158 of the person feeling terrified
1624.28 while the abuse was going on,
1625.79 feeling guilty, feeling
ashamed, feeling like, oh,
1628.74 they brought it on themselves.
1630.01 They deserve it.
1630.843 They don't deserve anything better, right?
1632.62 Because the brain is trying
to make sense of it, right?
1635.41 Or I thought I could make that
okay, but I couldn't, right?
1638.7 And then there's more
guilt and more shame.
1640.79 And if that's stuck inside of someone,
1643.23 like that's bundled up inside of someone,
1645.77 like a medical abscess inside a person,
1648.64 a walled off infection inside the body,
1650.96 this is the same concept in the brain,
1653.71 then of course the limb system
is going to want to fix that.
1657.008 And it fixes it by trying to
let's recreate that situation
1659.75 and make it right this
time and that's, I mean,
1662.51 I think that one of the best examples
1664.19 of how the right approach of
how like, let's look at that,
1667.23 let's talk about that, right?
1668.79 What's really going on there,
wait, who should feel guilty
1670.98 and ashamed is the person who is a abused
1672.82 or the person who is abusing, right?
1675.34 And we can get it what's
going on inside the person.
1677.557 And that's what changes that.
1679.12 And then the eighth relationship
can be entirely different
1681.61 than the first seven, right?
1682.98 And I see that all the time.
1684.37 I mean, this isn't esoteric or soft.
1686.8 Like I see that play out
clinically over and over again.
1691.35 And why do things get better?
1692.76 Because we go to the
trauma and we unlock it.
1696.46 It's not hidden inside where
it can control things, right?
1700.02 We bring it to the surface
1702.406 and we can take away its power.
1704.95 - I keep hearing in this narrative
1709.446 that so much of our
reflexive response to trauma,
1713.63 both emotional and in the
repetition compulsion in terms
1716.9 of behaviors is about
some very deep attempt
1721.38 to change the past.
1722.93 - Yes.
1724.08 - And in fact, in an offline conversation,
1725.95 I recall you saying
something about this, that,
1731.37 the number of behaviors
and thoughts and avoidance
1734.49 of behaviors and avoidance of thoughts
1737.288 that human beings put in to trying
1738.26 and change the past.
1739.144 - [Paul] Right.
1741.264 - Is remarkable and eerie and maladaptive,
1744.89 it sounds like.
1745.93 - [Paul] Yes.
1747.46 - And that really stuck with me
1749.881 because I think we all want
to feel like we're in control
1752.18 of our future and how
we feel in the moment.
1755.08 And to some extent, it
works for a brief while.
1759.57 There's this thing that
happened and it's just,
1763.177 it evokes some internal arousal
and then you have to know
1765.41 what to do with that arousal.
1767.783 And I think for many people,
1768.616 including myself, there's
this fundamental question.
1771.93 Okay, the thought about the
thing, the event or events,
1776.44 plural, evokes this arousal,
1778.75 this internal states, makes some people
1780.35 feel sleepy and exhausted.
1781.56 Other people feel really anxious.
1783.53 Other people feel angry.
1784.67 I mean that arousal has all
these different dimensions
1788.819 as you know,
1789.96 and then there's this question
of like what to do with it.
1792.2 - [Paul] Yes.
1794.145 And I'd love to hear a maybe even just
1796.72 a top contour prescriptive of
what do I, what does one do?
1800.3 I'll even just put myself
in it, what do I do?
1802.19 So I'm feeling upset about something.
1803.79 Should I feel like my options
are healthy catharsis.
1808.01 I could tell the story, feel it.
1810.97 I could.
1813.05 I can pack it down.
1814.7 We hear that it's bad to pack it down.
1816.29 But of course one has
to be functional in life
1818.62 and deal with things.
1819.61 And we have responsibilities at work
1821.91 and relational responsibilities, etcetera.
1825.58 We need to sleep at night.
1828.163 So catharsis, healthy catharsis,
1829.97 packing it down at the other extreme.
1834.05 Telling the story.
1834.89 And yet I think a lot of people
are afraid to tell the story
1837.01 because in that telling
1840.586 there is perhaps a
reemergence of the arousal.
1842.019 - Yes.
1842.852 - The arousal can become greater, I mean.
1844.05 - Yes.
1844.883 - Is that what people mean when they say
1845.81 things are going to get
worse before they get better?
1847.59 I mean, so I guess,
1848.95 the simple version of this
long-winded question is,
1852.59 it's clear we need to
confront these things.
1855.05 We can't change the past by,
1857.84 a reflexive response isn't
going to do that efficiently.
1861.04 And so how do we deal with arousal?
1863.19 How does one take what they feel
1865.06 inside about something shameful?
1867.16 What do you do with it in a moment?
1869.44 And does that have to be done
in the presence of a skilled
1872.43 trained therapist or
as I'm driving to work
1876.03 in the morning and something comes up,
1878.25 I can't deal with this
right now comes to mind,
1880.64 what do I do?
1881.473 Do I deal with it right then?
1882.84 I know this is a big
multidimensional question.
1884.99 - Yes.
1885.823 - But I think it's the one
1886.656 that a lot of people grapple with.
1888.03 We want to deal with things.
1888.99 How do we deal with that internal arousal?
1891.65 - Yeah, yeah.
1893.854 We so often try and change
the trauma of the past
1898.87 in order to control the future
1901.959 and what that really adds up
to is the trauma of the past
1905.41 dominates our present, right?
1907.83 And it doesn't have to be that way.
1909.73 And remember, we're talking about traumas
1911.87 that rise to the level
of changing the brain.
1914.03 So as you're saying,
1915.02 that involves re-experience,
it involves hyper vigilance,
1918.17 increased arousal.
1919.57 It changes in mood states,
1920.95 changes in anxiety, changes in sleep,
1922.98 changes in behavior.
1924.95 So these are all changes that in a sense,
1928.39 push towards dominating
our present, right?
1931.58 And then we're not really
living in the present, right.
1934.57 As we're trying to control the future.
1936.35 We're not going to do a great
job of controlling our future
1938.75 if we're not really living
in the present, right?
1941.68 And so the way to come at
that again in the moment,
1945.41 if we're saying, okay, in the moment,
1946.56 if I need to fall asleep, right?
1948.437 I might say, okay, let me try
and put that out of my mind.
1950.01 Let me try and thought redirect.
1951.22 So there's short term
strategies that can let us be
1953.93 functional in the
context of these changes.
1956.41 But the answer is to go look
directly at that thing, right?
1962.38 Look at that trauma, explore
that trauma, and sure.
1966.16 That can be done with a professional.
1967.6 And sometimes that's what makes sense,
1969.75 but not always, right?
1971.1 Sometimes it can be done
1972.18 by talking to another person, right?
1974.3 Writing it down, right?
1975.43 Look at what's going on inside of me,
1977.79 that my mind is so stuck to this.
1980.53 Let's explore that because
it's almost as if we're,
1983.78 we're so afraid,
1985.94 so often of looking at the
trauma that has changed us,
1990.7 that we'll look anywhere.
1992.66 But at that, right?
1994.61 It's like hidden in a closet
1996.09 and we'll shine the light everywhere else,
1998.06 but we're not going to open that door.
1999.97 And that's where
2000.803 people will say that same
as I've heard over and over.
2003.07 And I myself have thought
this at times like, oh,
2005.23 if I talk about that,
2006.063 I'm going to start crying
and never stop, right?
2008.11 Or I'm going to just fall apart, right?
2010.12 Which is never what happens.
2011.02 No one ever starts crying
and never stops, right?
2013.52 What ends up happening
2014.66 is when the person puts
words to it, right?
2017.42 It could be in writing,
2018.6 it could be talking to a trusted other
2020.05 or with a therapist, right?
2021.9 Things start to change.
2023.08 I mean, just the fact that
you can talk about it,
2025.84 you can put words to it
2026.673 and other people don't recoil, right?
2028.9 I mean, how many times has someone said
2031.05 something for the first time, right?
2033.66 And when they're telling
me about the trauma,
2037.749 there's such an anxious,
2039.272 like looking like as if I'm going to be,
2041.43 I'm going to recoil from it, right?
2043.24 Meaning I'm going to
recoil from them, right?
2046.412 And then there's a sense of
surprise if the person says,
2048.48 well, you know, I was abused by
2051.75 this coach when I was a kid, right?
2055.929 And there's not a, okay,
2056.762 there's not a response of recoiling.
2059.0 You can see the change and
people will say a lot, like, wow.
2062.41 Like, I can't believe like you can like,
2065.95 hear me say that and
be okay with it, right?
2068.42 I mean, so you think about
what's going on inside of them.
2070.59 Like how, what a sense
of shame, a sense of,
2074.4 this is something awful about
me for people to recoil from
2078.53 and it's just not true,
2081.146 but here's where trauma
is, it's insidious, right?
2085.137 And it's pervasive, right?
2086.14 Because if that convinces us
to continually hide it away,
2090.64 then how do we explore it?
2093.73 That example of the person who says, okay,
2096.503 I was abused by a coach
when I was a child.
2098.93 I mean, I'm thinking of a
couple, very real cases, right?
2102.33 People that I've taken care of.
2103.86 And once they start talking about it,
2105.74 then they start talking about how, ,
2108.96 they were just innocent kids, right?
2110.597 And like, they didn't know.
2112.12 And like, they really
wanted to be on the team
2113.78 where this coach was
treating them as special.
2116.12 And now they can look at
themselves from the outside, right?
2119.49 They can look at themselves
2120.69 like they would look
at someone else, right?
2122.897 You think it's so easy for us
to see what's real and true,
2127.77 if it's someone else, right?
2129.08 If you ask someone,
2129.913 what do you think of someone
who's 10, 11 years old,
2132.88 who's abused and manipulated
and abused by an adult?
2135.932 And you say, oh my goodness,
2137.796 I feel compassion for that person, right?
2139.13 But if it's us right then, oh no,
2142.02 it's guilt and shame and
we have to hide it away.
2144.44 And when the person starts looking at it,
2146.25 they can sort of see it from the outside.
2148.41 And it starts to take the
energy out of it, right?
2151.14 Then, well, who should
feel guilty about that?
2153.01 Who's done something wrong?
2154.58 And like, so now the
conceptions come together,
2156.94 which is often a reflexive,
that was my fault.
2159.75 Oh, I did it.
2160.69 I went back to it.
2162.58 I still stayed on the team.
2163.9 I went back next season, right?
2165.47 I let it happen again, right?
2167.1 All the guilt and shame inside the person
2169.34 gets juxtaposed to like,
what really happened there?
2172.03 And then they say, right.
2173.08 I was a terrified child, right?
2175.18 I didn't understand at all.
2176.63 And they can come to
a place of compassion.
2178.9 And now we are working
against the guilt and shame.
2181.57 And if the person cries about
it, then it's great, right?
2185.15 I mean, crying is one
2186.793 of the best coping mechanisms we have.
2188.18 It doesn't hurt us.
2189.46 And it lets us grieve things.
2191.07 Yeah, we can't grieve if there's guilt
2193.57 and shame inside of us,
2194.403 it just blocks grief, right?
2196.48 We have to,
2197.313 there has to be a clean slate
2198.5 in a sense in order to feel sadness.
2200.79 And then you see that it
shifts from anxiety, anger,
2205.01 and frustration, usually
directed towards the self,
2207.077 the guilt and shame towards,
2210.518 towards being able to process
it and being able to bring
2212.81 to bear some compassion
and being able to direct
2216.44 the negative emotions,
2217.68 so to speak where they're
warranted and my goodness,
2221.52 the changes that happen.
2223.448 I mean, it's not like people
are miraculously cured, right?
2225.97 But it's remarkable how
just getting it out there
2228.44 and having like one hour
of talking like that,
2231.33 like what we're talking about now
2233.8 can leave a person
feeling immensely better.
2237.36 - It seems to me in hearing this,
2238.7 that there's this weird
wiring that we have,
2243.24 because what I'm hearing is
when traumas happen to us
2246.0 or we observe them,
2247.14 what we need to do most
is to confront those
2249.617 and the emotions around that directly.
2251.95 - [Paul] Yes.
2253.212 But instead our system
defaults to guilt, shame.
2255.572 - [Paul] Yes.
2256.405 - And trying to hide it.
2257.238 - [Paul] Yes.
2258.518 And this repetition
compulsion of placing us back
2260.53 into things similar to those traumas.
2263.58 Or even maybe even worse traumas.
2265.84 - [Paul] Yes.
2266.673 - In an attempt to resolve it.
2268.155 It's like the most maladaptive.
2269.246 - [Andrew] Wiring diagram.
2270.93 I could possibly think of.
2272.011 - Yes.
2272.844 - Emotional and presumably
2274.31 physiological wiring diagram.
2276.02 - [Paul] Yes.
2277.971 And this notion of trying to change
2279.44 the past by doing things now,
2280.98 when the exact opposite is
what's going to be beneficial
2284.87 also seems like the complete,
2286.38 the whole system seems
completely backwards.
2288.21 And I'm, I'm chuckling as I say this,
2290.02 not because I'm amused it's
because I'm just baffled once
2293.0 again at how our wiring can
often not serve us well.
2298.43 But it raises an,
2299.97 what I think is an important
and interesting question,
2302.75 which is earlier, you
were talking about how
2305.77 people will seek out media
that's really disturbing.
2308.8 They'll traumatize and
re-traumatize themselves
2311.18 on a daily basis.
2312.76 So that could be viewed as
the repetition compulsion
2315.46 or the person will have
the same relationship
2317.9 with seven different,
2319.05 same abusive relationship
with seven different partners
2321.63 in sequence seems terrible.
2324.31 And yet,
2326.26 as I say this,
2327.1 it also is becoming clear
to me how this almost seems
2329.7 like a poor, but desperate attempt
2332.48 to resolve it in some way.
2334.145 - Yes.
2337.642 - And so the fork in the road,
if I understand correctly,
2341.206 is to really get to the seed incident,
2343.49 really get to the thing
that started it all,
2345.63 as opposed to repeating it all.
2347.53 - [Paul] Yes.
2349.9 - Does that have to be done in
the presence of a therapist?
2355.205 Is there a benefit to
taking a walk and thinking
2357.49 about these things,
breaking down and crying,
2360.22 if that's what's necessary
or feeling angrier,
2363.67 if that's what comes up?
2366.486 The reason I ask it this
way is because I worry,
2371.72 I'll just speak to my own experience,
2374.18 I worry that in reactivating
2376.34 or touching into the
emotions around something
2379.16 that is itself a form of
the repetition compulsion,
2381.61 because you're feeling it all over again.
2383.339 - [Paul] Right.
2384.172 - You're not seeking out
something to evoke that feeling.
2386.57 So I realize this is a little bit
2387.95 of a circular argument, right?
2390.24 Or question.
2391.7 But I think it's one that
I really struggle with
2393.65 in trying to parse all the,
2398.996 the outcome based
therapies that I hear about
2403.352 and the recommendations that people make.
2404.75 I mean, how should we conceptualize this?
2406.67 Something happens.
2408.02 Sounds like we need to deal
with that thing directly.
2410.42 Do we need to do that with somebody else?
2412.4 Can we do that on our own?
2413.49 If we're,
2414.323 we don't have resources and
we have to do it on our own,
2418.14 can't hire someone, can't
pay someone to work with us.
2420.396 - [Paul] Right.
2421.229 - How do we do that in a way
2422.07 that isn't retraumatizing ourself
2424.53 in a major way, or in a minor way.
2427.52 How do we know where we
are in that landscape?
2430.67 - Right.
2431.65 Again, those are, I
think, great questions.
2433.81 And I think it starts
with real introspection.
2438.233 When things are bouncing
around in our minds,
2440.08 often, it's very, non-productive right?
2442.37 It's the same thing over and over again,
2445.861 and that's not helpful for us, right?
2447.1 So there's an idea which sometimes
2448.88 gets called an observing ego, right?
2451.2 The ability to stop and look
2452.45 at what's going on inside of ourselves.
2454.6 And so if we're just thinking about it
2457.25 and we're thinking in the same way,
2458.61 we sort of, in a sense,
always think about it,
2460.9 then all we're doing is
reinforcing the trauma, right?
2463.56 But if we can distance
enough to be like, huh, it's,
2466.77 I'm interested in what's
going on inside of me, right?
2469.27 I can think of a certain person
2471.92 who really loves music.
2473.47 I mean, and at some point
in our therapy work,
2476.92 I learned like she was taking long drives,
2480.17 but the, the radio wasn't on.
2482.182 And I was like, well,
2483.015 what what's going on, right?
2483.848 And I asked,
2485.202 and what was going on
is she was running over
2486.47 and over again in her head, like,
2487.91 I'm a loser, I'm a loser, right?
2489.75 And she didn't want the music
on because the music would
2492.88 drown out what she felt she
had to say to herself, right?
2497.111 And it was that like, wow,
that's interesting, right?
2501.524 And then her ability to
observe that and to think,
2504.21 why am I doing that when
it comes into her mind?
2506.67 Like, what does that trace to,
when did I start doing that?
2509.043 Like I say, you know,
2510.75 I'm saying it for a point
of exaggeration, we're like,
2512.63 nobody comes out of the womb
2515.49 programmed to think I'm a loser, right?
2517.7 So we don't think that
when we're born, right?
2519.47 So where does that come from?
2521.35 Then, we can think in ways
2523.42 that allow us to have new thoughts, right?
2526.36 That we weren't having,
2527.193 It's not just bouncing
around in our minds.
2529.42 And if we speak or write,
2531.68 there are even more mechanisms
2533.18 that come online in our brains, right?
2535.33 That are then sort of
monitoring mechanisms.
2537.22 We think in a different way,
if we're using words, right?
2542.159 And we are better able often
to bring in that observing ego,
2545.31 like what's going on inside of me?
2547.679 So it can be very helpful to think,
2549.26 it can be helpful to talk to someone,
2550.88 to a trusted other, you
know, friend, family,
2553.65 clergy to write, I mean,
2555.82 these are things that can be done
2557.49 without expending any resources, right?
2559.85 And sometimes it can make
really a big difference, right?
2562.747 It was a way, when did
I start thinking that?
2564.81 And like, interestingly,
in this case, okay,
2566.44 we did it in therapy,
2567.89 but it became very clear what
that was rooted to, right?
2572.556 And then in the therapy,
2573.45 which was still relatively young,
2574.77 but we'd done several sessions
2577.415 and we weren't talking at all
2578.39 about what we needed to talk about, right?
2580.2 But that's what got us to
what we needed to talk about.
2583.29 And when did that start,
2584.48 and now we're in that same
place of exploring that
2587.73 and what was the reflex to it
2589.3 and the sense of guilt and sense of shame.
2591.5 And it's where all of that came from
2593.41 that just got boiled down
to I'm a loser, right?
2597.461 Which this person didn't
even have in their mind.
2599.29 Like, I didn't think about
myself that way, right?
2602.08 And that's is so interesting, right?
2603.62 That our memories don't in
and of themselves have meaning
2606.83 it's like they're flat
or colorless, right?
2610.22 And they're colored in by the emotions
2612.38 that we attach to them, right?
2615.417 So, the idea that certain memories now,
2617.67 before the trauma were changed, right?
2620.63 By the trauma.
2622.618 So I tell the story,
2623.451 sometimes of a person
who like won an award
2625.11 when they were in high
school that they thought was,
2626.95 oh my gosh, like it shows,
2628.14 like I can do it, right?
2629.48 I get out there, that after trauma,
2631.88 they saw the award with the
negative emotion attached to it.
2634.86 That was like, oh,
2635.693 it was given to me and
I didn't deserve it.
2637.3 And almost it was mocking.
2638.77 Like, it was going to be the
greatest achievement in my life
2641.08 and I was 17 or so, and to
have someone think like,
2644.51 that's not how they felt
about that at the time.
2647.64 It's the trauma that
changed, the self talk,
2651.42 the internal state going forward
2653.99 and talking about miraculous
in a negative way,
2657.25 also changed that going backward, right?
2661.156 And when we can really look at that,
2661.989 like where did that come from?
2663.47 And we can start
unraveling it, it changes.
2666.87 So in those cases, you
know, often it's helpful
2670.463 to have a good therapist,
it's not always necessary.
2673.37 And it certainly, it's not
always possible, right?
2675.84 So we need other strategies.
2678.09 And some of those,
2679.14 I write about some of those in the book
2681.546 of how can we sort of get at trauma
2683.17 without those formalized mechanisms.
2686.16 And sometimes if the symptoms
are significant enough,
2688.67 like we really do need to
talk to somebody professional
2691.75 who can help us get to
the root of the trauma.
2694.37 And there's so many times,
2696.1 that's the answer to what's
going on with people.
2698.63 People I've seen have had
five residential stays.
2700.86 I'm not exaggerating this,
for mental health reasons,
2703.73 for substance reasons,
2704.75 and no one's ever taken
a trauma history, right?
2707.1 And then when you take a
trauma history, you say,
2709.05 well, that's obviously where
this is all coming from, right?
2711.94 Like that's when the drug
use started truly thereafter,
2714.25 the negative self talk
and the negative feelings
2716.21 that led to the drug use.
2717.56 Then you go after the trauma
2719.7 and you can change things.
2721.24 Whereas trying to change
things without looking,
2724.24 introspecting, talking about the trauma,
2727.866 I think of course was futile.
2730.55 - Do you think that people
2733.361 can start to have negative fantasies?
2734.9 I mean, you mentioned this woman
2735.88 who would take these long
drives to berate herself.
2740.187 I'm not familiar with that, but I'll,
2742.57 I'll give a little bit of
personal disclosure here.
2743.67 I've felt several times in my life
2746.09 that I will start to create a narrative
2749.67 about something that truly hasn't happened
2752.08 about something terrible
that somebody is going to do.
2755.02 - [Paul] Yes.
2755.86 - That's going to upset me.
2757.64 - [Paul] Yes.
2758.473 - And for the longest time,
2759.804 I wonder why am I doing this?
2760.69 And I have a couple ideas about why, one,
2765.302 is that I was attempting
to just avoid thinking
2768.007 about other things.
2769.36 It's just, you know, anger is such
2771.21 an attractive emotional force in this.
2773.62 It's an attracting, it's not attractive.
2775.48 We don't like it.
2776.313 And yet, oftentimes anger is a great way
2778.97 to replace feeling something else.
2780.98 - [Paul] Yes.
2781.813 - Feeling sad or having to come up
2783.53 or to do work or to do something useful.
2786.66 So it has this kind of a like
gravitational force to it.
2792.24 That was one idea.
2793.75 The other idea was in imagining
kind of worst outcomes,
2798.289 then actually that relationship were,
2800.07 could actually seem a
lot better in reality.
2801.915 - Hm hm.
2802.748 - [Andrew] It's almost like
creating this negative contrast.
2804.17 - Yes.
2805.003 It's like, oh, well
then it's not that bad.
2808.049 And then the third possibility
is I have no idea why,
2810.55 but it seemed like a reflex.
2811.99 And I spent some time thinking about it.
2813.39 I can't say I've resolved it completely,
2815.32 but why would somebody
2817.87 have a narrative or a default
narrative when driving
2820.96 or when walking of I'm just
going to spend some time
2824.445 and think about how terrible
this thing is going to turn out
2826.08 or how someone's going to upset me
2827.34 or harm me or how terrible I am.
2830.79 It seems, again, like
maladaptive thinking,
2834.21 maladaptive wiring.
2835.76 And yet I have to assume
that it serves some purpose.
2838.81 - Yeah, yeah.
2840.398 I mean, I think there are three factors
2841.78 there and they're all bad.
2844.07 And I think you spoke to at
least two of them, right?
2847.36 They I think speak so powerfully
2849.76 to how insidious trauma
is and how these are real
2854.41 brain changes inside of us.
2856.33 So I would say that the
three factors, punishment,
2859.83 avoidance and control, right?
2863.42 So the trauma inside of us,
2864.66 that makes guilt and shame.
2867.12 So often, so often leads
2870.74 to a desire to punish oneself, right?
2873.397 And the idea that, oh, that was my fault.
2875.47 Or I deserve that.
2876.34 Well, what do we do if something
2878.08 is someone's fault and someone
2879.255 now deserves punishment, right?
2881.2 I mean, we we punish them, right?
2882.86 We send 'em to jail, we
give them a fine, right?
2884.89 We punish them.
2885.78 And so what, what we do is
punish ourselves, right?
2888.75 And if we tell ourselves we're a loser
2890.48 or this awful thing is
going to happen, right?
2892.59 Then part of what we're
doing is saying to ourselves,
2894.57 see, right, you deserve that.
2896.17 You're not going to have
anything better, right?
2897.64 It's a negative.
2898.65 It's a very negative
way that the brain tries
2903.31 to make us in a sense,
2904.57 to do better by hurting
us more for the things
2907.35 that we couldn't and
shouldn't have been able to,
2909.34 weren't expected to control
in the first place, right?
2912.27 The second is distraction.
2914.07 As you said, anger,
2915.28 that kind of fantasy can distract us
2920.237 from affect feeling and emotion.
2921.72 That can be much more negative.
2923.39 Anger, it can be more gratifying
2926.07 than certainly than guilt or shame,
2927.69 although guilt or shame can
serve a punishment purpose.
2930.02 But if anger is directed also
towards ourselves, right,
2932.743 then it can serve punishment too.
2934.64 So punishment, avoidance,
2937.0 and the sense of control
that if you think ahead
2940.28 to something awful,
2941.51 that you're imagining is going to happen,
2943.87 well, maybe that will
let you avoid it, right?
2946.02 I mean, you can see the
brain here in a sense,
2948.82 really confused.
2949.98 I mean, part of the brain wants to punish.
2952.16 part of the brain doesn't
want to think about it at all
2954.25 and part of the brain
wants to make it better.
2956.72 And then how all of that resolves,
2958.98 if we're not aware that,
2960.15 hey, this is in the context of our brains
2962.06 being deeply impacted by trauma.
2964.49 So what's going on here
is all maladaptive, right?
2967.59 'Cause these negative
fantasies of the future,
2970.02 they may help us feel better
about something in the present,
2972.98 but they don't help us make
anything better, right?
2975.67 They don't help us make anything better.
2977.84 So this is kind of the sequela.
2980.52 This is where trauma and
all this reflexive stuff
2984.12 that happens after trauma
ultimately lead us.
2987.26 And you can see how we get lost,
2989.09 how I've seen over and
over again in my own life,
2992.75 in the lives of other people,
2994.79 how man we get stuck in those situations
2999.14 and that's why I see people sometimes.
3000.501 This has been going on for
30 years, 40 years, right?
3004.02 And it's just been going on
over and over and over again
3008.216 because there's no natural
end to any of this, right?
3010.68 Unless we,
3012.302 we look at it in a different way,
3013.4 that we have knowledge and
information like, whoa,
3015.66 this isn't the way it has to be.
3017.2 Let me bring a novel perspective to this.
3019.68 It doesn't change on its own.
3023.651 - I'm struck by your statement
3026.466 that these thoughts or behaviors
can make us feel better,
3029.38 but they don't actually
make anything better.
3031.25 In that way,
3032.69 this mode of imagining terrible outcomes
3036.49 starts to immediately
seem like taking opioids.
3040.149 You feel better in the moment,
3041.82 but it doesn't actually
make anything better.
3043.307 And it probably makes things worse.
3045.23 - Yes.
3047.38 - And just a question of how much worse
3051.711 and in what direction, yes.
3054.12 And so I just want to just
pause on that concept,
3057.55 because I think that concept
of makes us feel better,
3060.72 but doesn't make anything better.
3061.94 I think it answers an earlier question
3065.74 about what seems to be a totally
maladaptive wiring diagram.
3070.25 We need to confront the thing,
3071.41 but we don't want to go into
the repetition compulsion.
3074.431 So it's a knife edge there,
3076.64 to navigate through trauma.
3078.45 - [Paul] Yes.
3080.13 - Working with a very skilled
clinician like yourself,
3083.21 I think is the ideal
circumstance for people.
3088.643 And of course there are people
who can't access support
3091.01 from somebody, for whatever reason.
3093.15 You've talked about journaling.
3095.03 - Hmm, yes.
3096.93 - As a useful tool.
3098.45 Could you maybe highlight
3099.38 some of the other things that
people can do on their own.
3102.58 And then I'd also like to talk about
3104.93 what makes for a good therapist.
3107.6 What should people look for
3108.58 for those that are seeking therapy,
3110.31 especially nowadays when a lot of therapy
3111.75 is being done remotely, but
let's just start with the,
3115.63 let's just call them self-generated
3117.59 or zero cost sorts of things,
3120.529 journaling being the first
3122.65 and then what are some of the others
3124.822 and what kind of structure
would you recommend
3125.78 someone put around journaling,
3127.7 carry a journal around all
day and jot things down
3129.66 as they come up or sit down
3130.86 and spend an hour writing
in complete sentences,
3133.23 for instance.
3134.26 - Yeah.
3135.093 If I could add something
to what you had just said
3138.11 before the question, right?
3139.55 That we have these short-term
3141.64 coping mechanisms in us, right?
3143.79 And in a way it makes sense, right?
3145.2 If we find ourselves in
just terrible situations,
3149.47 then a short-term coping mechanism
3151.36 can get us through them, right?
3153.0 So our brains are built that way
3154.65 and that's part of survival too, right?
3156.93 And whether now in the modern
world, whether it's food,
3160.21 it's drugs, it's sex, it's alcohol, right?
3163.64 Or it's negative thoughts, right?
3165.98 This is short-term soothing.
3168.77 Even the negative thoughts,
3169.787 And anger is short-term soothing
3171.57 at the expense of long-term change, right?
3175.46 And that's where addictive
pathways can come into play.
3179.51 And that's where, again, our,
3181.69 how we're built
evolutionarily for survival,
3184.76 doesn't help us, you know, in
the way humans have evolved.
3188.2 Like we haven't lived this way throughout,
3190.44 99.9% something percent
of human history, right?
3195.022 So we're not adapted to this.
3196.23 So I want to just make a point of saying
3197.57 that about the short-term soothing
3199.14 at the expense of any of long-term change,
3202.63 And then the question you had
asked about say journaling
3205.49 or what can we do that's
outside of professional.
3208.95 I think the hallmark of it
3211.02 has to be bringing new eyes to it, right?
3213.77 Like thinking about self with a curiosity,
3216.63 instead of just a simple
automaticity or repetition, right?
3220.4 Like, why am I thinking about this?
3222.6 When did this start?
3224.15 Why is this in me?
3225.67 Right?
3228.39 Whether it's words or
whether we're writing,
3230.47 that's so important.
3231.62 So I think for journaling,
3233.48 it depends on the person.
3235.0 I mean, we don't want
somebody carrying around
3236.53 a journal all day,
3237.39 if then there's a compulsion to,
3239.02 I need to write about everything
3240.13 that's going on in my mind, right?
3241.21 Like that might be good to okay.
3242.66 Write a little bit at night, right?
3244.3 Or someone who might think,
3246.05 sometimes this really comes
into my mind in a strong way
3248.517 and it could be unpredictable, right?
3249.89 I want to have the journal with me.
3251.83 So, ah, that thing is back in my mind now,
3254.87 let me write about it, right?
3256.48 Because then putting words to it
3258.19 and then being able to
read those words, right?
3260.52 And when people read,
3261.61 even do a little bit of journaling
3262.97 and they read like, oh,
3265.35 I thought again about
how I'm a terrible person
3268.48 who can't have a good life,
3271.06 because I was in such a bad car accident
3272.97 or because that person attacked me
3275.683 or because when I was in school,
3276.516 I was bullied because I looked different
3278.64 than everyone else, right?
3279.73 Or acted different from everyone else.
3281.48 Wow, to actually see that written out.
3284.84 It's a little bit of that,
3288.15 it's a little bit of that.
3289.74 Like when you're saying it to someone
3291.24 as if it were someone else, right?
3292.86 Because now there's
enough distance from it.
3294.81 Like I'm looking at the
words I wrote, right?
3296.513 That we get some distance
and we can start to integrate
3299.76 some of the, not just the compassion,
3302.85 but integrating compassion
and logic, right?
3305.41 Of like, okay.
3306.243 I feel a sense of compassion
now, wait, what does this mean?
3308.52 What really happened here, right?
3311.305 And gosh, I did start thinking
differently after that.
3313.42 I started, that's where
this came from, right?
3315.43 That's why I'm saying this,
3317.04 it's those kind of
revelations that we can have
3319.91 through again, the written or spoken word.
3322.54 And I think again, that
involves a trusted other,
3326.496 or writing, right?
3327.329 And I think that those
are ways we can do this,
3331.134 where we bring some de novo
perspective to something
3334.29 that often has been bouncing
around inside of us.
3336.88 And it's amazing to me that,
3338.733 I can see such intelligent
empathically, attuned people
3342.91 who've had the same thing
3345.5 running over and over again
in their mind for years.
3349.28 And it just points out that our brains
3351.19 don't automatically
say, hey, wait a second.
3353.79 I've been spinning wheels
here for a long, long time.
3356.47 Like, was there another
way to look at this?
3358.4 We need something from the outside,
3360.29 which can just be knowledge, right?
3362.04 Which is why I think what we're doing here
3363.9 or the reason I wrote the
book that I wrote was like,
3367.8 apprehending this like
amazing surprise to me, right?
3371.83 Which is like, wow,
3372.95 like some huge percentage
of everything I'm treating
3377.06 is rooted in trauma and the
opacity of trauma, right?
3381.23 Which is why we don't see
that, oh, the depression,
3384.24 the panic attacks, the
life change, the addiction,
3387.5 the maladaptive choices like, oh,
3389.25 this is all coming from
trauma because it hides itself
3392.814 in that opacity.
3394.3 So we need a de novo perspective
3396.83 if we're doing it on our own.
3398.25 And we need that if we're
doing it in therapy,
3400.44 which might link like finding
the right therapist, right?
3402.9 Which is also part of your question.
3404.59 - Yeah, yeah I definitely want to know
3407.524 about how to assess and
find the right therapist.
3409.27 Before we cover that, however,
3412.85 something came up in the
course of your answer.
3417.06 I can immediately relate to this idea that
3420.62 certain behaviors are really maladaptive
3425.139 and are stuffing things
down or avoiding the topic
3427.89 is problematic and bringing a curiosity
3430.12 and an introspection and
almost a third personing
3432.78 of the experience
3435.44 that we've had in order
to try and address it
3438.1 from a new, truly from a new perspective.
3441.08 It occurred to me as we
were discussing this,
3444.21 however that some people, and yes,
3446.48 maybe I'm talking a little
bit about my own experience.
3449.926 We have a sense of our own identity
3452.778 and how people view us and
our ability to be functional
3455.51 in the world in ways that we like,
3457.17 effective at work or a good brother
3459.07 or a good mother or father,
human being in the world.
3463.29 We have relationships.
3464.66 And I think that one
thing that I have heard,
3468.97 and maybe I've experienced
is that sometimes those
3472.69 maladaptive thoughts or behaviors,
3474.65 the things that generate a kind
3477.1 of a repetition of anger
or of arousal or activation
3480.07 or sadness, that we have
some internal process
3483.43 where we funnel that into a
functionality in the world.
3486.67 So we I'll give a more concrete example.
3490.35 So in thinking about things
that have upset me in the past
3493.72 and in imagining bad
outcomes in the future,
3496.87 there's a certain
internal state of arousal
3498.9 that comes about.
3501.323 And for many years, I
was able to use that,
3503.51 not to feel angry,
3504.91 but rather to work an
extra three hours a day
3507.25 - [Paul] Right.
3508.894 - Or to pack my schedule with
work and social engagement.
3512.58 So I could show up in a way that I,
3514.95 hopefully was a very good brother
to my sister for instance.
3517.025 - [Paul] Right.
3517.858 - So in a way it was a,
3519.62 it was a transformation
of something negative
3521.91 inside of me.
3522.843 - [Paul] Yes.
3523.676 - Into a functionality in the world
3526.029 that was actually very
rewarding and beneficial.
3527.749 - [Paul] Yes.
3529.129 - And yet in describing it,
3530.18 I can immediately see how it
would be wonderful if I could
3532.71 source from something else.
3533.543 - [Paul] Hm- hm.
3534.49 - And yet I, you can imagine,
3537.19 and I can imagine how
one would be reluctant,
3540.03 maybe even terrified of
giving up that source.
3542.158 - Yes.
3542.991 - [ Andrew] It's a fuel.
3543.824 - Yes.
3544.785 and I think in knowing some
of the traumas of other people
3548.387 and their reluctance
to work through those,
3551.05 obviously I'm not a therapist,
3553.504 I sense this over and over again,
3554.99 that one's positive identity
3557.86 can often be linked to something
difficult in their past.
3559.971 - [Paul] Yes.
3560.85 - And so people are reluctant
to give up this fuel.
3563.5 - [Paul] Yes.
3564.333 - Because it it's in that
sense, it's functional.
3568.16 The only thing that allowed
me to kind of start to address
3572.01 this and why I'm still
so curious about this,
3574.18 'cause I don't think I've worked
3575.78 through this process completely,
3578.0 again, a little more
self-disclosure there,
3582.537 is that I was told that these words,
3584.86 just imagine how much better it would be
3587.15 if you could source from a different fuel,
3590.97 a fuel that felt better.
3592.23 - Right.
3593.307 - Maybe it was on the, it was on this,
3594.52 this sentence.
3595.353 It was, maybe you could actually be
3598.93 much more effective.
3600.15 - [Paul] Yes.
3600.983 - Maybe you could be 10
times the better brother.
3603.18 - [Paul] Yes.
3604.013 - Maybe you could have 10 times
3605.5 more insight or work capacity, etcetera.
3608.33 So it's on that hint of a promise that I,
3611.75 at least I was inspired to
start looking into these things
3614.69 and reading about trauma
in your book and elsewhere,
3617.03 and start to think about this.
3618.26 So again, I realize this
is a long winded question
3621.27 and a somewhat complex idea, but I think,
3623.3 or I hope that people will
be able to resonate with this
3625.33 idea that sometimes we
want to stay attached
3628.448 to this short term soothing
that the punishment
3630.87 distraction or control
because it evokes this arousal
3633.94 and then we can apply that arousal.
3635.873 - Yes, yes.
3637.24 I think what you're describing maps
3639.18 I think clinically to what
gets called sublimation.
3641.77 So there's something
negative inside of us,
3644.61 but we sort of transfer that energy,
3646.52 we transfer that into something
3648.44 that is adaptive or
that is positive, right?
3650.77 So the idea of the anger, right?
3652.08 When I think of that thing
and it makes anger in me,
3654.35 I channel that into harder work, right?
3656.47 Or I channel that into like,
3657.68 I'm going to go be nicer
to my brothers, some right,
3659.64 something like that.
3662.197 And there's validity to that, right?
3664.38 But it can become like self
justifying if a person thinks,
3667.67 well, look at what this
is doing for me, right?
3670.05 I wouldn't work as hard without it.
3671.83 Right now we start to become
attached to the trauma.
3675.33 Whereas I think what you
had said is absolutely true
3679.09 that just because we can sublimate
3682.23 some of the negative
affect, feeling, emotion
3685.14 that comes from trauma into something
3686.9 productive doesn't mean
that that's best, right?
3690.577 I mean we can get to our destination
3693.0 by taking a very circuitous route, right?
3695.14 We might waste an hour getting
there, but we get there.
3697.7 That doesn't mean that that's best.
3700.26 And it also doesn't look
at all the negative, right?
3702.21 In this example, the wasted
fuel, the wasted time, right?
3705.21 We get somewhere, but
we are not optimizing.
3708.83 And I have yet to see one person
3712.477 who has addressed the trauma
3713.84 and become less functional, right?
3716.13 It's always either,
they're just as functional,
3719.07 but they're happier, right?
3720.73 Or more functional
because as you said, like,
3723.32 just because we may be
able to sublimate, well,
3726.766 maybe what's going on will
be 10 times better, right?
3728.98 If we weren't sublimating
3731.2 because the sublimation limits us, right?
3733.0 It limits our perspective
to only what we can see
3736.08 and do through the lens of the trauma.
3739.182 And that is never better
than the alternative.
3743.35 - Thank you for that.
3744.183 - Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
3746.64 - Let's discuss how one could
3749.65 or should go about finding
a really good therapist.
3754.85 Typically in my experience,
this is done by word of mouth.
3759.33 There's this person you
might want to work with them
3761.085 and they're really great,
3761.918 but what are some of the characteristics
3762.923 that one should look for?
3764.81 And should we take into account whether
3768.0 or not we are a person who for instance,
3771.81 I've heard this from listeners,
although I'm clearly,
3775.17 I'm definitely not talking about myself
3776.78 here in cloaking something.
3779.51 Some people will say,
3780.73 I want to work with a somatic
therapist because I've actually
3783.98 heard someone say, I think in fields,
3785.96 I feel stuff in my body.
3787.68 So I want to work with someone
3788.75 who can really acknowledge that
3790.22 or someone else will say,
3791.96 I want to work with somebody
who has this orientation
3794.71 or that orientation or is open
to my particular lifestyle,
3799.38 or isn't going to tell me that
I have to leave my relationship.
3802.54 I feel like people already
show up to the question
3804.53 of who to work with with
all these, you know,
3807.15 things internally,
3807.983 some of which are voiced
and some of which aren't.
3810.54 So I'd love for you to talk
about maybe some of the,
3813.12 the core features of a
really good therapist
3816.941 and then how to look for a therapist.
3818.5 And also how to think about oneself
3820.31 in looking for a therapist.
3821.398 - [Paul] Right.
3822.419 - Because of these kind
of predispositions.
3823.76 - [Paul] Right, right.
3826.446 Well, there's a lot of data about this
3828.81 over the years,
3829.67 if you look at what are the top 10
3832.09 important factors to find in a therapist,
3834.6 just repeat rapport 10 times, right?
3838.21 I mean, that's the key.
3839.53 And if you think about that,
3840.96 it's pretty amazing, right?
3842.1 Because therapeutic modalities
can be so different, right?
3845.5 And I think what that's
telling us is, in a way,
3849.33 something very obvious, right?
3850.53 Like what does rapport mean?
3851.88 Like, you know, it's somebody
3852.75 that's paying attention, right?
3853.85 It's trust, it's a back and forth.
3855.768 It's like, yeah. even though
I'm doing something difficult,
3858.91 I'm doing it with someone
who's really helping me,
3860.56 someone who's in it with me, right?
3862.07 Someone who's really paying attention.
3863.48 Wants me to be better.
3865.11 That's indispensable, I mean,
it's just indispensable.
3867.94 And I write in the book is someone,
3869.55 a therapist not making eye contact
3871.13 or this is the way they do it, right?
3872.62 And you know,
3873.453 you got to fit into the
box of the way they do it.
3875.54 That is not going to be helpful.
3878.14 And then what I,
3879.63 what I think about that is
the different modalities.
3882.92 It doesn't actually tell us that,
3884.5 oh, the modalities are irrelevant.
3885.99 I think that's not true.
3887.8 I think that good therapists
are not pigeonholed
3891.48 by a certain modality.
3892.97 They may come at the world largely
3895.72 through a psychodynamic
or a CBT or a DBT lens.
3899.3 There's lots of different,
3900.82 ways to do therapy.
3902.36 But when you really talk to those people,
3904.15 really good experience therapists,
3906.4 it's all coming through
the vehicle of the rapport,
3909.57 but they're practically shifting
to what the person needs.
3912.89 I don't understand the idea that like, oh,
3915.53 I just do this, right?
3917.59 I don't do that.
3918.423 And when people are pigeonholed that way,
3920.37 I don't think they help their
patients very well, right?
3924.056 We have to be diverse enough to say, hey,
3925.46 I want all the arrows
in the quiver, right?
3928.02 And even though there might
be one that I favor and that's
3930.29 the lens I see things through,
3932.0 no, I can be versatile, I can shift,
3934.13 I can adapt to what this person needs.
3936.66 And I think if you have
that, you've got to,
3939.85 if you have that, you've
got a winning combination.
3942.23 - Great, so people should
perhaps try a few therapists
3944.82 and maybe have a session or
two or three to see if they,
3947.86 the rapport feels like it's taking root.
3949.9 Is that?
3950.733 - [Paul] Yeah.
3951.566 - Do you have that right?
3952.399 - Yeah, and I think that's why word
3953.232 of mouth is important, right?
3954.065 If someone you trust tells you,
3954.898 hey, this is a good person
that says a lot, right?
3957.36 It already makes the pretest probability,
3959.68 is quite high.
3961.16 But yes, it's interesting to see
3963.673 when like people have a therapist
3966.07 or they called their insurance
3967.21 and they're assigned a therapist.
3968.4 This thought that like, oh,
3969.41 that's the person I have to have now.
3971.09 And it's like, no, you should look at that
3972.81 like anyone you'd be interviewing, right,
3975.33 for a job, right?
3977.3 But you got to bring again,
3978.38 the right set of thoughts
to that to be helped, right?
3982.93 Which is that I want someone
who has rapport with me.
3985.46 I don't want someone who's
going to make it easy, right?
3987.86 Who's like, well, it's,
gosh, it's kind of pleasant,
3989.64 because then that means
they're not talking
3991.03 about the difficult things, right?
3992.45 So if one brings, like, I know
this isn't going to be easy.
3994.84 I got to talk about
difficult things, right?
3996.87 Even if one doesn't recognize
3998.41 or I got to talk about
the trauma in me, right?
4000.38 But to go to therapy
thinking, no, it's, I mean,
4003.53 sometimes it's enjoyable,
but a lot of times, right,
4005.92 it's not, right?
4006.82 It's hard work.
4007.653 It can be excruciating.
4008.59 We can cry during it, but to say,
4010.57 right, that that's how
I'm going to be helped.
4012.13 And I want someone who's
going to do that with me,
4015.73 who's really looking at,
what's going on inside of me,
4018.3 how do we help me?
4019.32 And I can feel sort of
the robustness of that.
4022.4 If one brings that approach
and then looks at the therapist
4025.54 through that lens,
4026.79 you're very likely to
then move on from someone
4029.44 who's not a good choice, right?
4031.03 And really stick with someone who is,
4032.91 even though that doesn't mean
it's always like pleasant
4035.93 and enjoyable.
4036.763 I mean, it has to not be that sometimes.
4039.127 - Right.
4041.02 Maybe we could drill a little deeper
4042.31 into the mechanics of therapy.
4044.51 I put out a few questions to
audience asking what they want
4047.83 to know about therapy and it was amazing.
4050.06 I got hundreds, if not
thousands of responses saying,
4053.59 how should I show up to therapy?
4055.07 So for instance,
4055.903 should people take a five minute
meditative drop in before?
4059.27 Or should they just show
up cold and let it emerge.
4063.49 During therapy,
4065.31 is it a good idea to take notes
4066.68 or to not take notes
and then post therapy,
4070.34 how should clients,
4071.77 patients as they're sometimes
called, one or the other,
4074.87 I never know which,
4075.91 how should they process that information?
4078.33 Should they take some
designated time afterwards
4080.84 and in an ideal world,
4082.57 take a 30 minute walk
afterwards and think about
4084.92 the material or should they set it aside
4086.93 and come back to it?
4087.763 Of course there are constraints,
work and family, etcetera.
4091.11 But you know we,
4092.88 there's a lot of knowledge out
there about how to best show
4094.83 up to a workout, warm
up for five, 10 minutes,
4097.69 then do this, etcetera
and then the cool down.
4099.62 I mean, here, we're talking
about hard psychological work
4102.89 aimed at bettering oneself.
4104.34 So to my knowledge,
4106.31 I've not ever seen this
information anywhere.
4109.42 It'd be very useful to hear,
hear your thoughts on this.
4111.83 - Yeah.
4112.73 Well, I'm not trying to duck the question,
4114.89 but I think it varies so much by person.
4117.81 So if you think about the
first part of your question,
4119.53 I think was how to show
up to therapy, right?
4122.02 And I think the answer would be whatever
4123.72 lets you be fully present
when you're in therapy.
4126.82 Now for some people that's
going to be, I show up early,
4130.01 I say it, I call myself,
I meditate a little bit.
4132.54 I mean, that's how then
they're present, right?
4134.42 For other people, you know,
they just, they show up,
4136.78 walk into the room, they can
stop another present, right?
4139.17 So it's whatever works for that person.
4141.47 So that they're really
there, their thoughts,
4143.67 their energy is really in what's going on.
4146.24 And the same thing
applies on the other end.
4148.71 There are people who are
really well served by,
4152.74 going for a walk if they can,
4154.01 or sitting quietly after therapy,
4155.66 kind of putting that in order, right?
4157.18 Otherwise they lose some of it, right?
4158.84 Or like some of the ahas, right?
4160.753 Or the, oh, that's an interesting thought
4162.92 that they really need to put it in order.
4164.29 Maybe that involves taking some
notes during therapy, right?
4167.54 For other people, they need
to do the exact opposite.
4169.87 They need to like leave,
not think about that at all.
4172.88 And then they can reflect on
it later and learn from it.
4175.56 So we're so different.
4177.39 Human beings, there's
such a diversity in us
4181.224 that there's no hard answer to that,
4183.418 but it's like being present
when it's happening,
4186.04 then being able to sort of consolidate
4189.903 and retain what's been
gained is most important.
4193.13 And I think we have to figure
that out person by person.
4195.87 I mean, I try and do
that in the work of like
4198.11 what's serving this person best.
4199.46 And sometimes we,
4200.67 sometimes it evolves and
sometimes we talk about it,
4202.78 but it varies so much.
4204.55 - Hmm.
4205.383 - If someone were thinking about embarking
4206.98 on therapy or more therapy
4208.95 to address trauma or just
general issues of life,
4212.4 what is the frequency that you recommend?
4214.33 I could imagine two extreme models.
4216.32 One is, okay,
4217.37 I'm going to finally tackle this trauma.
4219.41 I'm going to do therapy
three times a week,
4222.16 but for a shorter period
of time, six months,
4225.47 over and out versus this open
ended model of once a week,
4230.4 typically for as long as it takes.
4234.4 - Right, right.
4235.84 I think that also varies.
4238.89 And I work with people
in varied ways from oh,
4241.94 someone who's doing well
4242.773 and like we meet for a half
hour every six months, right?
4245.72 To doing week long,
4247.27 hourly sessions, to
spending three intense days
4251.4 with someone in a row, right?
4253.16 So I think as far as like
kind of guiding principles,
4258.57 what I have found in my own life,
4261.08 'cause I value my own
therapy tremendously.
4265.76 So I found in my own life
and in my own clinical work
4268.88 that if it's less than once a week,
4271.4 then it's hard for us to retain really.
4274.79 We spend a lot of time
kind of catching up, okay,
4277.75 what's happened?
4278.583 Let's get back to the place
we were at before, right?
4280.96 Which is why I think if we're
really going to get somewhere,
4283.26 we're not just trying to
maintain something, right?
4285.41 Then I think once a week for an hour
4287.56 is really kind of the minimum, right?
4290.29 But more intensive work.
4291.593 It's like the more I intense it is,
4295.07 it's not linear, right?
4296.19 It's an exponential gain.
4297.48 Like we do a lot of intensive work, right?
4300.8 where someone will come
and do 30 clinical hours
4304.17 with us over the course of a week.
4306.46 So five or six different
clinicians, 30 clinical hours.
4311.121 And you know,
4312.617 we've found that the benefits
of doing that are immense.
4315.12 It's like let's say a year's worth
4316.48 of therapy consolidated and
you take well, 30 hours,
4319.59 let's say, we go almost every week,
4321.87 maybe that's 45 or 50 hours,
4323.94 but 30 hours with that kind of intensity
4327.53 is worth probably 60 hours,
4329.89 done in a different way,
4331.8 because then it's in us
in an active way, right?
4335.04 It's in the therapist in an active way,
4336.8 it becomes very, very dynamic.
4338.82 So I think turning up the intensity,
4340.91 if there's something that
we really need to process,
4343.68 absolutely makes sense.
4344.82 And I do that in my own life
4345.91 is something now's
like, whoa, it's really,
4347.94 somebody is really distressing me
4350.562 and it's linking into prior trauma
4352.387 and I can see what's going on in me.
4353.24 Now I start to have
ruminative thoughts, you know,
4355.31 with negativity, I'm like,
I got to go more, right?
4358.17 Because I got to do that processing.
4360.19 So I can get to the place that I am,
4361.99 which is not that,
4363.213 it's not that the trauma
has no impact on me, right?
4365.2 It' that the impact is much
less than it was before
4368.03 the therapy and that I most often
4371.82 and more often than not
have an ability to see
4374.65 when it's now intruding into my thoughts.
4377.41 And it's taking me away from like
4379.34 what I really think and believe,
4380.61 or being able to draw
logic and emotion together
4382.97 and make good decisions.
4384.35 Turning up the intensity
then absolutely makes sense.
4388.3 - This very deep, intensive
work of 30 hours in a week.
4393.26 What brings somebody to some,
the type of work of that sort?
4398.12 Is it a suicide risk or a
severe addiction situation?
4402.26 I mean, how does one
gauge how much therapy
4404.24 they ought to be doing
and should it always be
4409.45 on the therapist to decide that frequency?
4414.41 What would bring someone
4416.254 to a situation of five
therapists in 30 hours
4418.1 a week in one week?
4420.07 - Right, right.
4421.998 Yeah, it's usually a person
who is really distressed
4425.72 by something whether that's,
4428.01 it's so negatively impacting their life
4431.49 or sometimes a person
comes to realization.
4433.33 I just can't take this anymore, right?
4434.7 I'm sick of the cyclical depression.
4436.74 I got to stop having panic attacks.
4438.09 I need help, right?
4439.89 But it's usually some,
4441.92 crisis point with the idea
of crisis in the meaning of,
4445.65 okay, something comes
to a head and after it,
4447.82 things are going to be different, right?
4448.97 Not a crisis and things are
going to be negative afterwards,
4451.75 but a point where, where then
that cognitive flexibility
4455.23 comes to the fore of like,
4456.063 well, I need to do
something different, right?
4458.36 So that's often what brings us.
4460.63 Sometimes it's other
people pointing it out
4463.14 or somebody's had an
intervention somewhere or yes,
4466.37 that person's been hospitalized
after a suicide attempt
4469.17 or they've gone back to
4471.02 rehab again for the third or fourth time.
4473.077 And their life is really in danger.
4475.08 Sometimes it's that.
4476.05 And sometimes it's a person
realizing, yeah, I just want to,
4479.2 I want to look at myself, I want
to understand myself better.
4482.23 I know that what's going on in me,
4484.06 isn't as good as it can be, right?
4486.62 So I think people can come to it
4487.93 for all sorts of different ways.
4490.59 And I think, yes,
4491.423 I think a lot of times it
would be the therapist to say,
4494.38 more work, more intensive
work or can make a difference.
4498.32 But I think the person also needs to,
4500.99 take ownership, right?
4502.25 Of their own therapy and say,
4503.17 if I don't feel helped enough,
4504.95 well, I have to think about that, right?
4506.71 And talk to the therapist
about that, 'cause it,
4508.45 maybe that therapist isn't a match, right?
4510.96 Or maybe you talk to the
therapist and the therapist
4513.04 can change his or her approach, right?
4515.66 Or maybe you talk to the therapist
4518.086 and increase the frequency, right?
4519.27 But the idea is to be aware of it, right?
4522.38 And if one's needs,
4523.35 aren't being met to
acknowledge that, right?
4526.397 'Cause people can get
into a rhythm of therapy
4528.44 where it's really not helping them, right?
4530.82 But they either feel sort
of nihilistic about it.
4533.24 Like, oh, I'm no better and
I'm going to therapy, right?
4536.659 Or sometimes there's a sense
that while I'm in therapy,
4538.73 so I'm kind of checking
that box of doing something
4540.78 for myself, but it's not
really getting me anywhere.
4543.34 And then the part of the
brain that's controlled
4545.16 by the guilt and shame and avoidance
4547.2 thinks that's a great idea, right?
4549.03 So again, this ability
to observe ourselves
4551.28 and like what's going on,
4552.49 am I being helped in the way,
4553.95 do I feel helped, right?
4555.67 Am I in some ways,
4557.56 even like happy that
I'm not feeling helped.
4559.919 'Cause I don't have to face
4560.752 this thing I don't want to face, right?
4562.18 Or am I too afraid to say
I need more help, right?
4564.64 Do we really need to look at ourselves?
4567.84 And this is where the insurance systems
4568.673 often are very difficult,
4570.441 'cause it's hard sometimes
for a person to say,
4571.55 I need more therapy 'cause that
may not be possible, right?
4575.823 So there are sort of negative factors
4577.65 in the world around us.
4578.7 But ultimately I think the
answer to the question comes down
4582.218 to observing ourselves
and taking ownership
4584.2 of like what's going on in
us and how we're feeling.
4587.757 And then feeling that,
4590.48 that commitment to self
or to self-care to say,
4592.26 I need to go change this.
4593.73 - And for those that
maybe don't have the means
4595.95 or insurance or access to do even one day
4599.56 a week therapy in the journaling model.
4602.49 - [Paul] Yes.
4603.35 - Could one perhaps take an entire day
4607.445 as awful as it might seem,
4609.376 to do a lot of journaling
and thinking and walking,
4611.47 do a self-generated intensive.
4614.42 Do you think there's utility to that?
4617.441 - I mean there could be,
4618.274 but again it depends by person 'cause
4620.33 there could also be
something negative about that
4622.12 if it's someone who's not at the point,
4624.92 not ready for that, right?
4625.91 I mean we don't come at,
4628.367 we don't come directly at
the trauma immediately,
4630.51 at least most of the time
we don't do that, right?
4633.8 And we often don't explore it in depth.
4636.61 Like this idea that, oh,
4637.61 that person now has to go through
every second of the trauma
4640.34 is actually not true.
4641.35 I mean sometimes it is, but that's,
4644.1 that's not the common situation, right?
4646.38 So more often that
person has to acknowledge
4648.81 like the example of like
I was sexually abused
4652.406 and have to acknowledge
that and to, and say,
4653.84 okay, like, gosh,
4655.12 what has that done to me?
4656.41 That doesn't mean,
4657.243 well let's parse out every moment
4658.61 of like how that was and
the terror of that, right?
4661.6 So that can lead people
to a worse place, right?
4665.248 So, I think the idea of
biting off small pieces,
4669.48 so to speak where a
person is writing, right?
4671.96 Or is talking.
4673.07 But I think if one is writing,
4674.41 it is good to communicate
with another, right?
4677.33 Another trusted person.
4679.19 And if there's not someone
in one's personal life,
4681.76 there are clergy members,
4682.68 even if one isn't a affiliated
with an organized religion,
4685.649 you could probably go places
4687.34 and get clergy to want to help you, right?
4689.64 I mean, there are people out there
4690.73 who want to help other people.
4692.0 So we say, what if someone
has no one, I mean,
4695.09 almost never do we have
no one here, right?
4697.16 'Cause we could probably go find someone,
4699.635 but we need to kind of
take that in pieces.
4702.01 So there's some risk like trying
to do the intensive thing,
4705.43 you know, on one's own.
4707.08 And that's where I would put in,
4709.564 if a person's having suicidal thoughts
4711.0 or even thoughts of death,
of not wanting to be alive,
4713.62 I don't deserve to be alive.
4714.81 I mean, these are warning
signs for really getting help.
4717.43 So there are some signs that say, hey,
4718.89 don't try and do that on your own, right?
4720.8 Go try and find a resource.
4722.4 And it's things that get to
that level of severity of,
4726.22 and often a person knows that.
4727.063 I mean, am I in a place where I know
4729.45 I'm not healthy
4730.34 and I'm having kind of scary thoughts,
4733.945 then we need,
4735.088 that's a person who
really shouldn't be doing
4735.921 that on their own.
4737.08 - Great, thank you for that.
4737.95 - Yeah, you're welcome.
4739.36 - So we've been talking
a lot about talking.
4741.42 - Huhm.
4742.62 - And now I'd like to talk a
little bit about chemistry.
4745.68 - Yes.
4746.513 - Drugs.
4747.346 - [Paul] Yes.
4749.07 - So maybe first we could
talk prescription drugs.
4751.641 I mean you're a psychiatrist,
so you're approved to,
4753.81 and presumably do prescribe
medication where appropriate.
4758.31 I mean, this is a vast
landscape of course.
4760.33 We've got ADHD and I should just tell you,
4763.34 I get more questions about
ADHD and the drugs related
4766.47 to ADHD and dopamine than any
other topic, any other topic.
4771.29 So there's ADHD, there's
OCD, there's depression,
4775.47 there's antidepressants and so forth.
4778.69 Is there some way that we can,
4780.71 wrap our arms around all of that
4782.8 as a way of waiting into this,
4785.25 this drug question and just address,
4788.71 how does one decide when
medication is useful?
4791.28 Because in the end,
4792.81 the dissection tool that the psychiatrist
4794.97 or therapist has is language.
4796.83 And at some point,
4797.663 one has to make an assessment
about dopamine or serotonin
4800.78 or whether or not a given drug would help.
4802.77 And most therapies,
4806.307 I believe don't involve putting
someone in a brain scanner.
4809.22 And to my knowledge,
4810.728 there still is not a very
good blood test to assess,
4812.69 oh, is this person's dopamine low or high,
4814.67 correct me if I'm wrong.
4815.96 And ultimately that,
4817.92 and I know there are companies out there,
4819.16 so I'm not trying to
undermine those companies.
4820.69 But if I happen to do
that in this statement,
4822.1 if you take a blood test
and find that your serotonin
4824.146 metabolites are low,
4826.68 my understanding is it's
possible that you are too low
4829.47 in serotonin in the brain,
4830.61 but that's a very indirect window
4832.17 into what's really going on.
4833.68 So how does,
4836.176 how do you think about
prescription drugs in the context
4839.51 of treating trauma and other
conditions and then maybe
4844.02 we'll drill into some of the
more specific conditions?
4846.49 - Sure, I mean,
4848.001 I would first comment that
right there aren't tests
4850.15 for these things.
4851.81 And I think the tests for metabolites,
4852.66 I mean, things are so different.
4854.53 By the time, what we're talking
about has been metabolized,
4858.18 often to some very significant extent.
4860.15 Left the brain,
4861.03 now it's in the peripheral blood
4862.28 that we really don't
learn from that, right?
4864.55 I think that we tend to over
utilize medicines in this
4869.31 country because we have
a healthcare system
4873.652 that often that's so based
on throughput that we want to
4876.2 polish the hood when there's a
problem in the engine, right?
4878.37 So we overutilize medicines
often as an end point, right?
4882.03 Oh, we're going to make that
person's depression better
4883.73 with an antidepressant.
4885.46 Well, I mean maybe, right?
4887.25 But most of the time for
the person's depression
4890.79 to really get better and stay better,
4892.41 they need to unravel what's
driving the depression, right'
4896.594 So the first step is I think
4898.31 they're cut two steps to it, right?
4899.81 The first assessment step is,
4901.97 is there a diagnosis that,
4905.877 that the vast majority of the time,
4907.31 if not sometimes, all the time,
really warrants a medicine?
4910.61 So the bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right?
4915.03 These are diagnoses that we,
4917.19 we understand more about
them and what's going on
4919.93 in the brain and how medicines
can treat or stabilize them,
4923.88 which doesn't mean the
medicine is necessarily,
4925.69 it's not a substitute for therapy, right?
4928.921 But sometimes the medicine and
therapy can go hand in hand.
4931.24 So for OCD, for example,
warrants therapy, but it almost,
4935.78 not always, but it almost
always warrants medicine too,
4938.93 so that you can ease the
systems that are making
4941.35 the rigidity and the
repetition in the brain.
4943.87 So the first kind of branch point can be,
4947.01 what is the diagnosis?
4948.13 What is the level of severity, right?
4950.12 And I think that's very,
4951.33 very important where I
think it's a little more,
4954.039 maybe even interesting is using medicines
4959.63 to help the person engage in the therapy
4962.93 as productively as possible.
4965.29 And here's where I think we're so limited
4969.036 by how we categorize medicines
4970.42 and this sort of pharmaceutical
4973.75 insurance driven medical system
4977.47 we have that I think throws
us off in tremendous ways.
4981.84 So you think about how
medicines are categorized,
4984.01 so antidepressants.
4985.8 And the vast majority of people who are
4987.72 helped by antidepressants,
4989.27 they're not, they don't have
4990.34 clinically severe depression, right?
4992.49 Those medicines create more
distress tolerance in us, right?
4996.61 And if you think about
how helpful that can be,
4998.98 if you're going to go,
4999.813 now you're going to do
something difficult, right?
5001.07 You're going to bring that
trauma or the stressors
5003.55 to the surface and you're going to process
5005.17 and you're going to try
and make life change.
5007.12 If we can make more
distress tolerance in us,
5010.08 that can be so, so much better, right?
5012.84 And think about the category
of medicines that are called
5014.91 antipsychotics, which really
puts people off, right?
5018.87 But most of the prescriptions
for antipsychotics
5021.67 are not for psychosis, right?
5023.6 And there are ways in which
low dosing of some of those
5027.34 medicines can help intervene
in negative pathways, right?
5031.91 In pathways that are about distress.
5035.042 And sending out those tendrils
5036.24 of neurons that are about hyper vigilance
5039.673 and avoidance, right?
5040.506 In in our brain.
5041.43 And we can often get at that.
5043.46 And if you can improve
someone's distress tolerance
5045.77 and you can use medicines
5047.39 that take away what clinically
is rumination, right?
5051.531 Not the standard meaning of that word,
5053.33 but the clinical meaning of it,
5054.86 where there are distress
centers in our brain
5056.973 that are overactive.
5058.827 And then we get stuck in these
maladaptive negative pathways
5062.38 where we think about something
over and over and over again,
5065.22 with no real chance of solving
it because that's not what's
5068.0 going on inside of us.
5069.58 So medicines can help that,
5072.03 but we have to have some flexibility
5073.7 around their conception
5076.438 and the modern medical system
of like 15 minute visits,
5079.68 to a psychiatrist that are weeks apart.
5082.36 I mean, I don't understand
how that goes well, right?
5086.09 In the vast majority of times,
5087.23 I think it doesn't go well
because it's not enough time
5090.34 to do the therapy, even
generate the understanding.
5093.804 So then medicines get
thrown into the person.
5095.17 This is how,
5096.21 we use, I think approximately
five times as much medicine,
5099.7 I think across the board as say
the Dutch population, right?
5103.281 Then you think, well,
why is five times more,
5105.0 is a lot more medicine, right?
5107.53 And you know, they have
a healthcare system
5109.69 and a cultural system that to
the best of my understanding
5112.86 is more rooted in taking
responsibility for oneself, right?
5116.47 So if a person comes in and
cholesterol is high, right?
5119.51 The first order of business is,
5121.5 hey, you could take better
care of yourself, right?
5123.18 Like this person really needs to lose
5124.59 some weight exercise more, right'
5126.74 They're not just jumping to like,
5128.05 let me give you a medicine and you know,
5129.68 and shift you through
the healthcare system
5131.99 and out the other side of the door, right?
5133.87 And the same thing is
true in mental health,
5137.63 and I'm not trying to be critical
5140.375 to the psychiatrists or the
nurse practitioners or people
5142.71 who are practicing in that way,
5144.57 because oftentimes there
is no choice, right?
5147.08 If they're working in a
healthcare system that,
5149.24 that the standard is highly
spaced or spaced apart,
5154.98 15 minute visits, what
alternative is there, right.
5158.29 But to look at, okay,
5159.593 I'm going to use medicines
because I don't have another
5161.82 tool to bring to bear.
5163.54 So I think the healthcare system
and its focus on throughput
5166.67 and it's short term talk about,
5168.42 we talk about short term response, right?
5170.299 Short term soothing at the
expense of long-term health.
5173.78 And I think that is the metaphor for,
5176.43 that applies to our
healthcare system, right?
5178.75 Where if we,
5181.025 if we are going to try and
treat a symptom in a short term,
5183.43 we're going to do it in a 15 minute visit,
5185.01 that we're going to do it in a way
5186.74 that maybe it soothes a symptom,
5188.08 maybe it doesn't, but it
does not get at the problem.
5191.84 We need to invest more
resources to get at the problem
5195.0 and I think that's
where a sort of protest,
5197.71 if people, as a society, we say,
5199.74 look, we don't like the way
our healthcare is going.
5202.59 Like, we need more focus
on what the actual problems
5205.14 are that yes,
5206.35 we would spend more money,
5208.43 to treating people and
taking care of people
5210.45 'cause it's more human time,
5212.12 but ultimately about less
suffering, less death, right?
5216.24 And ultimately more productivity.
5217.9 I think as an economy,
5219.41 we would save so much money
if we spend money on the human
5223.106 aspects of mental healthcare,
5225.35 because people would be more functional.
5226.95 They're spending less time
in the hospital, right?
5229.38 They're more productive
when they're working.
5231.563 There's less entry into the
criminal justice system.
5236.077 So I think medicines get overused
5238.96 in part for systemic reasons,
5241.47 in large part, for systemic reasons.
5243.4 And also for some of these
categorization reasons,
5246.14 oh, that person meets
some technical criteria
5248.61 for depression.
5249.443 We got to give them this medicine
instead of really thinking,
5251.38 wait, what's going on in this person.
5253.61 And I see this over and over again.
5254.96 I see one who is on seven medicines
5256.9 and they're on seven medicines
5259.013 to treat seven different symptoms.
5260.06 And now they have side effects
5261.25 from all those seven medicines.
5262.34 Maybe two of them are to
treat the side effects
5264.14 from the other five, right?
5267.149 And that's bad, right?
5268.43 And if you really get at
what's going on in them,
5271.12 now they're doing much better
5272.69 and maybe they're on two medicines, right?
5275.06 So I dunno if that's a
helpful answer to that.
5278.24 - It is, it's a very helpful answer.
5280.03 I mean, I think at least in the spheres
5282.57 that I run these days,
5283.98 I hear a lot of negative
statements about antidepressants.
5286.47 I think, I'm old enough to remember
5288.68 the book, "Listening to Prozac."
5291.58 I remember when Prozac and its
5294.11 and things like it
first started showing up
5295.797 and the excitement.
5296.85 And then nowadays I hear more
about the problems with all
5300.36 these drugs and maybe that's just,
5302.3 'cause I have arms in
the, both the scientific,
5304.5 but also in the kind of wellness community
5306.04 where people think a lot
about behavioral change.
5308.14 Fortunately I think
that's that they do that.
5311.46 But of course these
drugs, as you mentioned,
5313.08 can have enormous utility as well.
5315.23 - [Paul] Yes.
5316.063 - I'd like to just pick up on one theme
5318.14 that I haven't heard a
lot about anywhere else,
5320.15 which is the short term versus
5321.36 the long term use of these drugs.
5323.04 'Cause I could imagine,
5325.04 someone feeling like they're
finally going to tackle something
5327.76 that's been inside them
for a long time either
5330.15 because they're really struggling
5331.73 or because they're just done with
5333.76 not working it through
5337.943 and they decide to start a medication
5341.13 that would give them higher
levels of distress tolerance
5344.11 for a short while.
5345.7 I mean, is there anything to say
5347.605 that someone couldn't take a
properly prescribed medication
5351.86 for a week or for the first
three months of the work?
5355.92 - Yes.
5356.753 - And then know that they can come off it
5357.586 because I think that the black
and white model of, okay,
5360.25 you're either going to start
this drug and stay on it forever
5362.47 or be taking some drugs forever.
5364.752 - [Paul] Right.
5365.971 - Or you're not going to take anything.
5367.05 I mean, that just seems to,
5367.95 life doesn't have,
5369.11 does life have to work that way?
5370.78 - [Paul] Right.
5371.613 Is there a short term use
that can be effective?
5373.69 - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
5375.3 In American medicine we are
so much better at starting
5378.72 medicines than we are at
taking them away, right?
5382.517 And part of that I think
is driven by such a strong
5386.01 presence of the pharmaceutical industry
5387.75 and the pharmaceutical industry
5389.467 does a lot of very good things, right?
5392.82 But you know,
5394.33 there's such thing as too
much of a good thing, right?
5397.13 And then as a society, when
something seems positive,
5400.44 this I think also is human nature.
5401.97 We can overinvest in it, right?
5403.81 So you think about when Prozac
and those kinds of medicines
5406.58 came out, they were safer medicines,
5409.13 they're billed as antidepressants
and the thought was,
5411.31 well, they're going to
fix depression, right?
5413.32 And it's not how that works, right?
5415.94 So if we look at them as tools, right,
5419.17 then we can deploy them
sometimes for the longer term
5422.46 'cause sometimes that's necessary.
5424.24 But absolutely for the
shorter term, absolutely.
5428.01 If we thought of Prozac and
those kind of medicines,
5431.07 not as, oh they're
antidepressants, we think, look,
5433.92 what they do is they,
5435.95 they seem to make there be
more serotonin in certain
5439.39 circuits that are important
for mood regulation,
5442.564 anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.
5445.67 So those medicines can
really help somebody
5447.93 if they're very severely depressed
5449.52 and we want to sort of
get them feeling better.
5451.9 They can also help someone if
they could use more distress
5455.55 tolerance in a discrete
period of time, right?
5458.54 When we think about them that way,
5460.43 we think about them as
tools that we could apply
5463.147 for short term or long term.
5464.97 We don't see them as fixes, right?
5467.52 And we don't see them as then substitutes
5470.48 for the human to human work
5472.38 that needs to be done.
5473.35 I mean, I've been sort of in my training
5475.84 at times in healthcare systems
5477.89 and I've seen in many other circumstances
5480.03 that look at medicines as
answers and this idea that,
5483.58 that person is a, and a lot of times
5486.07 there'll be a number, right, right?
5487.647 And the number is the diagnosis
5489.82 and that number gets this medicine.
5492.33 And I'm not sure we could
be more misguided than that
5495.907 and that's what leads to adding
medicines, adding medicines,
5498.023 it's not working.
5498.97 Of course it's not working,
5500.52 because no one's really paying
attention to what's going on.
5502.52 So add more medicines and then
medicines for the medicines.
5504.99 And I mean, we know this is true.
5507.44 We know this is true,
5508.86 but we haven't had the
wherewithal as a society
5511.98 to say like with a lot
of things in society,
5514.31 to say like this isn't okay, right?
5516.32 I mean, we need more.
5517.5 Like give these people
who are trying to help us.
5519.34 They need more latitude to help us.
5521.05 We need more human to human contact
5523.52 to get at what's really going on, and yes,
5526.07 that's an investment of
time and energy and money
5529.34 in the short term and
sometimes that's money
5531.12 from the systems, right?
5532.56 But if we do that, my
goodness, look at the,
5535.33 look at the payoff of that.
5538.66 - What is your thought about anxiety
5542.141 and ADHD as a separate phenomena,
5545.31 in terms of medication.
5547.24 Again, ADHD is the thing
5550.02 that seems to come up most in questions.
5551.92 I can't tell you the number
of especially students,
5554.82 but also young working professionals
5558.41 and even people who are
5560.06 outside those categories
who are interested or taking
5566.77 Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil
or Armodafinil or Vyvanse,
5570.87 because they seem to
struggle focusing without it.
5573.64 Or, and I don't know,
5575.19 'cause I'm not one of those individuals,
5577.47 or because they seem to just
like how well they can focus
5581.59 when they do take those compounds.
5585.448 And so my understanding is
these compounds mainly increase
5587.38 dopaminergic transmission in the brain,
5589.34 also adrenaline, epinephrine in the brain.
5592.44 So they're more or less stimulants.
5593.68 They look a lot like, at least chemically,
5595.27 they look a lot like
cocaine and amphetamine,
5597.08 although they're not quite
cocaine and amphetamine.
5600.01 So should we be concerned about this?
5602.23 Is this a different sort of epidemic?
5605.54 Can these drugs be used to train the brain
5607.84 to focus and then people can
withdraw from these drugs?
5610.87 I mean, I think this is a huge topic
5613.01 and one that maybe warrants
its own episode entirely,
5616.836 but as long as we're on the topic,
5617.669 what are your thoughts
about medication for ADHD?
5620.08 - Sure, I think medication for ADHD
5623.35 can be extremely effective
5624.89 and the studies show us that, right?
5627.7 They show us that if there is ADD,
5630.65 then medication for ADD,
5633.02 is very, very helpful and
that's true in youths,
5636.2 it seems to be true if adults
have adult ADHD or ADD,
5640.78 we kind of know that's true,
5643.505 but all attention deficit
5645.09 is not Attention Deficit Disorder, right?
5647.89 And there we go to the
reflexive 15 minute visits,
5651.89 throw medicines at things, right?
5653.81 Attention deficit can come
from many, many places.
5657.59 And one of them is anxiety, right?
5660.053 There's so many other reasons
depression affects attention,
5663.87 poor sleep affects attention,
5665.46 poor diet can affect attention,
5667.32 stress in life can affect attention.
5669.75 So, and, and certainly trauma.
5671.52 And the thing,
5673.315 the problems that trauma spins
off can affect attention.
5675.909 So this is really the,
5676.742 this is really the truth that
while teaching once about
5680.695 medicines and pharmacology,
5682.87 I was frustrated about how
the answer to everything
5686.74 was like, what medicine do we use?
5687.89 What medicine do we
use, as opposed to like,
5689.67 this is just one piece of the puzzle.
5691.59 And I told an anecdote, which,
5694.36 I think it was a clinical anecdote,
5696.45 like what do you think is going on?
5697.46 And I think that if I
told that to, I dunno,
5701.53 middle school students or something,
5702.74 they would probably say,
5703.98 you just told a story of a
person with a rock in their shoe,
5707.41 which is what I, the story
5708.54 that I was actually telling, right?
5711.744 But several people I was talking to,
5713.24 they're physicians, right?
5715.202 ADD, right?
5716.66 It's like, no,
5717.601 every time the person
steps down the rock hurts
5719.27 and they're not able to
maintain attention, right?
5721.58 Like that's what's going on.
5722.94 But we're so programmed
to think about medicines
5727.1 and inappropriate use of
ADD medicines, as you said,
5730.31 there's dopaminergic impact.
5732.36 There's epinephrine,
norepinephrine impact.
5734.55 We're affecting what are called
5736.63 prefrontal alpha 2 receptors
5737.463 that like really need to be
helped if there's real ADD
5741.35 but if there isn't, that
is not a good thing to do,
5744.57 which is why it is quite fascinating
5746.64 that when people have ADD,
5748.95 they tolerate generally
stimulants very well,
5752.16 without the other problems
that can come of stimulants.
5755.18 And again, I don't know, I
don't claim to know why that is,
5757.67 but we see that phenomenon.
5759.73 But when people are being treated for ADD
5762.82 and they don't have ADD,
5764.08 which sometimes they
know they don't have ADD,
5765.86 but the stimulants make
them function better.
5767.5 So they go to somebody
and get the stimulants.
5770.03 That's not a good thing to do, right?
5772.1 'Cause stimulants, when
they're not needed over time,
5775.04 they do affect our physical function.
5776.97 They affect our judgment, right?
5778.51 There are a lot of negative
things that come from that.
5780.81 They can affect the
vigilance inside of us.
5783.739 So, yes, it's a valid diagnosis,
5786.63 but it gets made when it's
not present very often,
5790.51 which we see with a lot of diagnoses
5792.46 that you can throw medicine at.
5793.63 We see the same thing
with bipolar disorder.
5795.8 True bipolar disorder
is extremely important
5798.48 to utilize medicines effectively,
5800.58 but how many people are
diagnosed with bipolar disorder
5803.16 who have, they absolutely
don't have bipolar disorder,
5806.78 but it can be a catchall diagnosis
5810.745 because there is in a sense,
5811.578 "something to do for it," right?
5813.84 And you can throw medicine at it, right?
5815.55 So I mean, what do we expect, right?
5817.65 If we have a healthcare
system where you get 15 minute
5819.793 visits with your psychiatrist,
5821.5 of course we're going to
throw medicines at everything.
5823.46 And then the training paradigms
5825.09 are going to look at it through that lens.
5827.33 And then very often again,
5829.04 I give the example of seeing
somebody on seven medicines.
5831.64 I mean the first thought I
have is how many of those
5834.249 medicines are actually counterproductive?
5837.06 And a lot of the time it's not like, oh,
5839.13 every now and then one
is counterproductive.
5841.02 No, that's the case.
5842.55 That's the case a lot of the time.
5844.34 And again, I come back to,
5846.12 if we're not putting thought into it,
5848.71 what other result would we expect?
5852.02 - Thank you for that answer.
5854.01 I'm very curious what
constitutes negative effects
5857.34 of stimulants.
5858.173 So if somebody's taking
Adderall or Ritalin in order
5860.99 to work longer hours or focus
5863.19 because they have attention deficit,
5864.77 but not necessarily ADHD.
5866.88 And again, I'm not
recommending anyone do this.
5868.58 I've just heard the numbers
that have come back at least
5871.31 from surveys and discussions
5872.88 with colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere,
5875.05 other college campuses that
upwards of 75% of college
5878.78 students use semi
regularly, these drugs off,
5882.11 not by prescription, just
to study and to learn.
5885.12 - [Paul] Yes.
5886.17 - I can imagine sleep
issues because people,
5888.45 because these are stimulants,
5889.81 what sorts of other issues
can they create for people
5892.94 problems that they can create?
5894.33 - Sure, I mean,
5895.413 I think a touchstone maybe
5896.85 that's running through
our conversation, right,
5899.416 is prioritizing the short term benefit
5901.62 over solving a long-term problem, right?
5904.55 Which we might say is a human tendency
5907.06 and we see it across the
topics that we're discussing.
5910.66 So, short-term use of stimulants.
5912.59 Sure, people are more alert.
5914.07 They can stay awake more,
5915.66 they can study more intensely and longer.
5918.36 Okay, there's some
short-term benefit of that,
5919.415 over there, even there,
there can be problems, right?
5923.42 But we can say,
5924.79 let's just say for sake of
argument that in the short term,
5927.03 there's something to be
gained by doing that, right?
5930.481 But oh my goodness,
there's so much that is,
5933.46 there's so much risk to that, right?
5935.21 And how many times have I seen someone
5937.11 who they're doing that
5937.96 and they're just doing
that to study, right?
5940.18 And now they're addicted
to the amphetamines
5942.87 and their behavior changes
and they don't know it.
5946.33 Talk about shifting our brain
towards a more defensive,
5950.39 sort of suspicious, outward look,
5953.48 view of the world that
we see a lot of that.
5956.11 So we see judgment impairment,
5958.66 we see heightened levels of anxiety.
5960.87 We see more impulsivity
in decision-making.
5964.21 And sometimes we,
5965.53 it can get to the point
of seeing Frank psychosis.
5968.22 Now, that's not common,
5969.66 but have I seen young people
5972.01 who've done exactly what
you're describing, right?
5974.07 They're using Adderall or
they're using Ritalin to study.
5977.38 And then I see them when they're
coming into the hospital,
5979.96 they're screaming about how
someone's trying to hurt them.
5982.597 Boy, it's the worst case scenario,
5985.61 but it shows like that's
where that can go.
5987.96 And how much is there between the,
5989.9 oh, I'm just using it to
study and that severe,
5993.15 outcome that is actually
quite negative for a person
5996.7 and it might change how they think
5997.9 about that friendship or
that relationship, right?
6000.28 A lot negative happens
when we change our brains
6003.66 without an ability to see like,
6005.31 what is it actually doing to us?
6006.7 So, which is part of my whole
theme about trauma, right?
6009.57 It changes our brains and
we don't know it, right?
6012.42 Well the same can be,
6014.636 the same is often true of
amphetamines used inappropriately.
6017.92 It shifts our brain.
6020.399 And we don't realize that we're
a little bit more impulsive
6022.27 in our decision making, a
little bit less trusting.
6024.78 These are significant negative things
6026.77 that if we don't know it,
6027.877 the person will just say, yeah,
6029.56 oh, I'm just using it to study.
6030.69 I'm using it to work more.
6032.42 That's not, you know,
6033.94 that's not without it's
high level of risk.
6037.73 - What are your thoughts on cannabis?
6039.63 I've said it many times on this podcast
6041.58 before and I'll say again,
6042.53 I feel fortunate that I've
never really been attracted
6045.02 to alcohol or drugs of any kind ,
6048.508 so much so that if all the
alcohol and all the marijuana
6052.43 and all the cocaine
amphetamine disappeared,
6055.87 I wouldn't notice any
change in my life, right?
6059.362 And I feel lucky in that way,
6060.24 'cause I know a lot of people feel
6063.12 an attraction to these things
6064.684 that it is almost a gravitational force.
6065.623 - [Paul] Yes.
6066.456 - From their first drink, they just feel,
6068.37 I once heard it described in this,
6069.95 I think it was an Augusten
Burroughs book, "Dry"
6072.18 where he was an alcoholic.
6073.39 He said that the first drink he had,
6075.41 it felt like this magic elixir
6077.25 that meshed with the
physiology of his blood
6080.38 in the most seamless way
6081.69 and as I was reading this, I thought,
6082.86 oh my goodness, first of all,
6085.07 that's the most foreign experience
6087.29 for me in terms of alcohol.
6089.05 And second gosh, that must be terrible.
6091.98 And you can,
6092.813 but at the same time you
could really understand
6094.45 why someone would be drawn to that.
6096.03 - Yes.
6097.041 So cannabis nowadays is legal
6099.19 or decriminalized in
many areas of the U.S.
6102.37 A lot of people seem to use the argument,
6106.67 it's better than drinking
6109.894 or they only do it for
sleep or anxiety management.
6114.623 I'm not looking to demonize
or support the cannabis.
6117.67 So what are your thoughts about cannabis
6119.22 for anxiety management, depression?
6121.39 And maybe even for ADHD for that matter.
6123.77 Sure.
6124.603 - If I could make an
alcohol comment, right?
6127.88 The number of times I've seen alcohol
6130.03 like having been a good idea for coping
6132.39 with something approaches zero, right?
6134.813 Like the alcohol for
coping is just never good.
6138.95 And there's an additional risk
factor that there's certain
6142.12 genetic profiles where people
respond strongly to alcohol.
6146.44 Like, as you're saying, it's not just,
6148.13 oh, there's a little bit of
short term relief of distress,
6151.42 but there's this sort of euphoric response
6153.42 and those genetics,
6154.93 we don't understand them completely.
6156.33 They seem to be in Northern
European populations,
6159.57 more prevalent as you head
west in Northern Europe.
6162.21 So we understand where risk
factors are demographically,
6165.66 but we can't pinpoint
that for any one person.
6167.95 And there's a tremendous risk of that,
6170.02 when a person responds so
strongly to alcohol or habituates
6173.46 coping to alcohol.
6175.51 Cannabis is a little bit
of a different story.
6177.5 I mean, how I have seen that play out,
6180.69 and again, this isn't
coming from any expertise
6182.84 around the neuro the
neuropharmacology of it,
6186.427 like how is this really
working in the brain?
6188.23 But it comes from an observation
6189.67 that what it seems to do is
to narrow our attentional
6194.18 perspective, right?
6195.22 So it's why people will
say, well, they want to,
6197.41 they want to use cannabis
6198.41 before like watching a movie with friends
6200.08 or something, right?
6200.913 And, and I think, okay,
6202.09 I think why people are doing that
6204.21 is because our cognitive spectrum narrows.
6207.32 And then instead of worrying
about that thing at work
6209.47 or that relationship issue,
one can just be present, right?
6212.63 It gates out other
attentional intrusions, right?
6216.45 So in some ways, I mean,
6218.32 I've absolutely seen it
be helpful to people.
6220.67 I mean, it's been legalized
in Oregon, which is where my,
6224.27 I spent a lot of my time
6225.337 and it's not where all of my practice is,
6228.419 but what I have seen is
it is at times helpful,
6230.29 safe around sleep, right?
6231.5 Because a person can gate
out other intrusive thoughts
6234.25 and they can just relax and go to sleep.
6236.36 But there can be another side of that too,
6238.83 that at higher levels of distress,
6241.09 at higher levels of tension,
6243.08 what it can do is narrow the focus
6245.66 of cognition to the thing
that is negative, right?
6249.54 So the idea that, oh, like,
oh, this is a treatment for,
6253.27 depression, anxiety,
trauma, is not true, right?
6257.01 Can it be helpful under
certain circumstances?
6259.84 Like I think the answer to that is, yeah.
6261.46 I mean, I know the answer to that is yes.
6262.7 'Cause I've seen it play
out clinically that way,
6264.87 but think it can also be harmful too.
6267.29 So there, again, like
anything that has any power,
6270.23 power to influence our brains,
6272.09 we want to be thoughtful
and careful about it.
6274.063 I mean, do I think that
it's safer than alcohol?
6276.71 Yes, I mean, I mean, like we,
6278.34 we so clearly see that.
6279.97 Does that mean?
6280.984 Or it's just uniformly safe?
6282.3 No, right.
6283.36 So we want to be respectful of anything
6285.7 that can change how our brain is working
6287.827 and I think that includes,
6289.09 certainly includes alcohol.
6290.34 And I think it certainly
includes cannabis too.
6293.67 - I'd love to talk about
psychedelics for two reasons.
6298.43 One, there seems to be a
tremendous amount of interest
6301.47 in psychedelics as a
therapeutic clinical tool.
6304.6 I know there's also recreational
use and I'll just preface
6307.22 all this by saying that
my stance is we absolutely
6312.38 know for sure that these
are controlled substances,
6314.64 they're illegal to possess,
6315.7 sell or use in most of the country.
6318.78 There are few areas where
it, they are decriminalized.
6321.76 - [Paul] Yes.
6323.07 And psychedelics is a
broad category, of course.
6325.68 And we can touch on some of
the different, different ones,
6330.25 but whereas five years or so,
6332.25 five years ago or so I
was truly afraid to say
6334.93 the word psychedelics in
any kind of public venue,
6338.4 there are laboratories at
Stanford working on ketamine,
6341.44 psilocybin, MDMA, mostly in animal models.
6345.56 There's terrific work going on
6348.38 at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine,
6350.46 Matthew Johnson's Lab,
6351.59 and others looking at the
clinical applications,
6353.76 mainly of high dose psilocybin and LSD.
6356.37 There's the maps trials with MDMA.
6358.316 - [Paul] Yes.
6359.149 - So nowadays it's safe
for an academic like me
6361.78 to say the word psychedelics.
6363.0 And I'm, I'd love to
approach this question
6365.07 of psychedelics from a place
6366.63 of true exploration and curiosity.
6368.79 But with the preface that
we're talking about this
6372.27 in a legal clinical setting.
6374.74 - [Paul] Yes.
6376.014 - And the legality is something
that's now in process.
6379.2 I don't think it's completed,
but that's my understanding,
6382.3 but there are trials.
6384.15 You can go to clinical
trials.gov and put in MDMA,
6389.12 and you'll see a bunch of clinical trials
6390.77 that are happening in
the recruiting subjects.
6393.63 So I think it's safe to
have the conversation now,
6396.52 and I'd love your thoughts
about psychedelics.
6398.91 Maybe we could start
with psilocybin and LSD
6403.52 as a broad category of drugs,
6405.24 that at least my
understanding is they touch on
6407.19 mainly the serotonin system,
6409.39 some specific receptor
activation and modulation,
6413.505 tend to change notions of space and time,
6415.99 adjust internal state.
6417.55 Maybe we would start there.
6418.767 - [Paul] Yes.
6419.803 - And then maybe venture
into some of the other ones.
6420.79 So what are your thoughts on
these drugs for therapeutic
6423.12 potential also potential
hazards, etcetera.
6427.87 - Yeah, I think if we look
at the true psychedelics,
6430.38 so psilocybin and LSD, right?
6432.19 Because ketamine and MDMA,
6434.02 they're different categories of medicine.
6435.64 They're these sort of novel
tools to bring to bear.
6439.07 But if we start with psilocybin,
LSD, true psychedelics,
6443.01 I think why it is,
6445.01 why they have gained so much momentum over
6448.37 the last several years is
because the data coming
6451.69 from the labs and the academic centers
6455.67 is so powerfully positive.
6458.08 And as someone who's,
6459.08 I'm interested in anything
6460.73 that's potentially helpful, right?
6462.68 And I want to learn and understand that
6464.53 because a lot of things that
are potentially helpful,
6467.568 you know, you go and look at the data
6468.401 and you see that that's not
helpful, that's harmful.
6470.83 I think what we have
seen with psychedelics
6474.861 is that they're so helpful, right?
6476.87 And the trials are bearing that out.
6478.63 And of course these are
used in professional hands
6481.13 and with the right kind of guidance
6482.527 are extremely powerful tools,
6484.35 but used in the right way
6487.002 by someone who knows how to utilize them
6489.491 in the right setting can have
an immense positive impact.
6493.15 And that's why I think
6494.94 that the thought is there
across people and more and more
6498.37 people feel comfortable saying
it and talking about it,
6501.243 I mean we're in the state of Oregon now
6503.09 where the thought is,
6504.92 we're moving towards
legalization of psilocybin
6507.49 early in 2023.
6509.8 And it's part the new data, right?
6512.29 And how it meshes with
the older data, right?
6514.67 How it meshes with data
from the 60s and 70s
6517.53 that showed such a strong, powerful impact
6520.15 of these medicines.
6521.3 And I have a whole set of
thoughts about what's happening
6523.825 there and they're just
their conjectures, right?
6527.363 But my read of, you know,
6529.2 as best I can try and
understand the neuroscience
6531.82 and the clinical applicability
and the changes is,
6536.72 what happens is we see less communication
6539.63 or less chatter in the outer
parts of the brain, right?
6542.897 the the outer parts of the cortex.
6544.74 And I think that as human beings,
6547.69 we sort of glorify the parts
of the brain that only we have.
6552.51 I mean, certainly in my growing up, right?
6555.079 I mean, what did I learn?
6556.11 Even if you think about like,
6556.95 learning about the brain
in high school, right?
6558.88 I learned that like, wow,
6560.11 we're great as humans
'cause we have language
6562.447 and other animals don't
6564.01 and we can use tools and
like aren't we so great
6566.66 because we have this part of
the brain that other animals
6569.12 don't and it lets us function, right?
6572.64 Okay, there's some truth to that.
6574.569 That we can do things others can't do.
6580.092 But we get lost often in the
outer parts of the cortex,
6583.21 which I think are about survival, right?
6586.36 So we come back to the things you
6587.62 and I talked about early on of like,
6589.74 why are these trauma
mechanisms in us, right?
6591.233 So like so much of what's going on
6593.13 in our brains is about survival.
6594.97 And I think living so to
speak in the cortex, right?
6599.07 And the outer part of the brain
6600.63 is consistent with a focus on survival.
6603.55 So if you think that's where language is,
6605.11 that's where vision is,
6606.44 that's where executive function is.
6608.04 So planning and task execution,
6611.47 so much of that is about making our way
6614.43 in the world around us.
6616.44 So we tend to glorify
that and think, well,
6618.49 that's in a sense where
our existence is, right?
6621.41 And I believe that is not true, right?
6624.16 And again, can I say that for
sure, of course not, right?
6626.92 But my read of 20 years
of doing clinical work
6629.44 and thinking about all sorts of medicines
6631.41 and thinking about the psychedelics
6634.19 in a lot of depth,
6635.76 I think that what they do is they take us
6637.57 out of the cortex, right?
6638.723 Because that's where we
run into these problems.
6641.36 That's where we bounce
things over and over again
6643.443 that the distress centers deepen our brain
6645.597 and the brain stem kind of
align with the outer parts
6649.82 of the cortex and they say, right,
6651.59 we we're in distress.
6652.71 We want to stay alive.
6654.21 Often a lot of us have had
trauma that makes these changes
6657.49 in the brain and then we're
thinking all the time,
6659.82 like what would I do
if, if there were war,
6662.64 what would I do if there's
civil war, if someone bombs us,
6665.511 what will I do if the
economy collapses, right?
6667.78 What will I do if somebody gets sick?
6669.41 We're thinking all this future projection
6673.127 that is all coming from
a place of fear, right?
6675.67 It's all coming from a
desire to think about things
6678.097 and control the future
with this part of the brain
6680.72 that is so uniquely human, right?
6683.71 And I think when we take
the neuro transmission
6686.25 out of those places, right?
6688.14 And we set it in a part of the brain
6690.17 and say the insular cortex, right?
6692.22 The parts of the brain
6693.28 that are sort of in the middle, right?
6695.008 Which I think, I believe is
where our humanness really is.
6699.45 So the psychedelics make there
be less chatter communication
6702.59 in these other parts of the brain.
6704.457 And then we become seated
in the part of the brain
6708.01 that I believe is most
about our experience
6711.15 of true humanness,
6712.63 which is why, when you read about,
6715.01 people who have experiences
and I've heard about them
6716.877 and people talk to me about this, right?
6719.436 They've utilized it.
6720.269 They talk with me.
6721.31 So whether it's someone
telling me their story
6723.3 or it's coming from research data,
6725.63 it's why people can sort
of see with clarity that,
6728.61 oh, that trauma, that thing
is not my fault, right?
6733.929 Like we feel a sense of
compassion for ourselves.
6735.23 We relieve ourselves,
release ourselves from guilt
6738.01 and you say, why is this
so helpful to people?
6741.41 And I think it's because it can do
6744.21 what we are trying to
get at in good therapy,
6747.13 but it can really catalyze
that by just putting a person
6750.81 in that part of the brain that can see it
6753.39 for what it is,
6754.63 without all that chatter
in the cortex about,
6757.25 hey, got to think it's your
father, you won't avoid it again
6759.088 and that makes the repetition compulsion.
6760.99 How do I think ahead to the
next thing that might happen
6762.467 and what else bad might happen?
6763.94 I mean, we don't get anywhere doing that.
6766.43 And I think where we get somewhere
is when we seed ourselves
6769.86 deeper in the brain,
which I think we do if,
6772.28 if we're like doing really
good therapy and we're,
6774.56 we're in the deep parts
of the brain, but these,
6777.76 these psychedelics,
6779.39 the medicinal value I believe
is putting us in that part
6782.78 of the brain where a person
can really find truth.
6785.58 And that's why I think that,
6787.79 that's come so far in these few years
6790.35 because I think that is
very clinically evident.
6794.34 And I think we're going to
see more and more of the value
6796.81 of that and how, what the
psychedelics do can become,
6801.17 I believe a heuristic for
understanding like wait,
6803.92 how are our brains really functioning?
6806.62 And what are the parts that really matter
6808.68 to our experience of being human?
6811.56 It's those parts of the brain, right?
6812.717 The deep parts of the
brain, the insular cortex
6815.88 and the areas around it that
say light up when a person
6819.21 has an experience of spiritual ecstasy
6822.73 or an experience of connection
with another person, right?
6826.892 We kind of have these telltale
markers that something
6829.04 is going on there that's very
important and very special.
6832.3 And I think we're more
attracted to the outer parts
6834.62 of the brain in part 'cause
they're easier to study, right?
6836.743 I mean, as you know, better than I do,
6838.69 we started studying the brain
through lesion studies, right?
6841.21 'Cause it was easy to,
6842.043 or to see if a person got
hurt in this part of the brain
6844.19 or had a stroke in that part
of the brain, what changes?
6846.81 So we look at the cortex 'cause one,
6848.65 it's easier to study and
we tend to glorify it.
6851.59 And I think that has been misguided.
6854.74 And I think that we're learning.
6858.12 about how that's been misguided
6860.1 through the study of these
6862.3 novel modalities from
Western perspectives,
6864.68 would of course they've
been used for a long,
6866.38 long time in other cultures,
6868.45 but novel from our perspective.
6870.67 - Yeah, I'm fascinated by this idea
6873.015 that in these middle brain structures is,
6874.58 is where our humanity lies
6876.96 and as you said,
6877.9 I also wonder whether or not
other animals experience life
6882.42 more from that orientation
with less chatter.
6885.19 We can only guess, but.
6887.338 - [Paul] right.
6888.171 You know, that a dog lover
6891.821 and being in the presence of
animals that seem to just be
6893.9 present in what's happening in
their immediate environment,
6896.53 not too much anticipation.
6897.825 - Right, I mean, through sentient right?
6899.697 I mean what you're talking about
6900.53 is sentience, it's important.
6902.932 And sentience is extremely
important, right?
6904.49 And if we're going to
overvalue say language,
6906.92 then I think we undervalue
sentience, right?
6909.49 Which is why I think we tend
to undervalue animals, right?
6913.23 And their suffering, we say,
6914.37 well, they're not saying
anything about it, right?
6916.16 And you know, they're not
writing about it, so, okay.
6918.37 It's easy to ignore and we think about,
6920.84 again the hubris of that right though,
6922.55 because we can think and talk and write,
6924.29 like we must be feeling more
6926.28 than species that don't do that.
6928.29 I mean I think,
6929.123 I think that that is so true
6931.07 and that we're going to
understand more about sentience
6933.68 in other species and how,
6935.56 that's at the core of existence.
6939.653 And my hope would be that we value
6941.9 more humans and animals, right?
6943.75 Through the evolution
of that understanding.
6948.701 - The hallucinations that
accompany psychedelics
6952.67 like LSD and psilocybin have
such an attractive force
6956.35 to them as a concept and as an experience.
6961.592 And so I think most often when
people hear hallucinogens,
6964.51 they think, and psychedelics,
6965.9 they think about hallucinating.
6967.3 - [Paul] Right.
6968.215 - It makes sense why they would.
6969.048 - [Paul] Right.
6970.159 - But what's so interesting to
me is nothing in your answer
6972.47 about psychedelics,
psilocybin and LSD focused
6976.02 on hallucinations, per se.
6977.85 It was more about feeling states,
6979.29 accessing a feeling state or a relation
6982.13 to an event or to a person or to oneself.
6984.44 Maybe even I,
6985.273 I caught hints of maybe
even empathy for one's self.
6988.236 - Yes.
6989.069 - [Andrew] For the first time.
6989.902 - Yes.
6990.735 - None of that had to
do with seeing sounds
6994.08 or hearing colors and these kind of cliche
6996.516 statements about hallucination.
6999.0 So I am aware of laboratories,
7001.51 one at a University of
California Davis in particular,
7004.07 but a few others that are trying
7005.19 to generate chemical variance
7008.11 of psychedelics that lack the
hallucinogenic properties,
7012.92 but maintain these other
properties as therapeutic tools.
7016.75 And as I say that, I realize that I,
7018.94 people in the psychedelic
community are probably thinking,
7022.26 oh, that's horrible.
7023.093 That's the dismantling of the core thing.
7025.97 But the simple question is,
7027.62 do you think the hallucinations
are valuable for anything?
7030.84 - And I think we're really
getting into the philosophical,
7034.5 right, the ontological, right?
7035.91 There's this sort of trying
to understand being, right?
7040.267 And I don't claim to
know the answer to that.
7042.42 I think that at times it
seems like the hallucinations
7047.64 have a metaphorical or a symbolic way
7051.76 of being helpful, right?
7052.86 Because people will come
to understand things
7056.03 that they hold dear and true
after the experience, right?
7062.27 That often, not always,
come through the lens
7065.814 of the hallucinations.
7066.93 So are the hallucinations necessary?
7070.24 Are those hallucinations
sometimes important sometimes not?
7073.776 I mean, I think we don't understand that.
7075.87 And I think we want to be respectful
7077.91 of the sort of mystery of that.
7079.92 But what I think is fascinating
is when you think about
7082.98 like substance abuse and
what that means is, well,
7085.88 one aspect of that is that
a person has experiences,
7088.58 thoughts, conceptions of self in the world
7090.7 with the substance that
without the substance,
7092.95 they know are wrong, right?
7094.384 People talk about, you
know, liquid courage, right?
7096.247 And okay, I feel better about myself
7097.397 and I feel courageous 'cause
I've had a couple of drinks.
7099.41 Now, when I, when I, after that,
7101.86 I feel like normal about myself
and that was false, right?
7105.54 And we see that like,
7106.373 that's part of what substance
intoxication means, right?
7109.72 But what we see with the
psychedelic medicines
7113.47 is something that's
incredibly different, right?
7115.87 That people are having
experiences that are so delinked
7119.29 from our normal experience of reality.
7122.15 And then when they come in a
sense back online with right,
7125.11 in a normal cognitive way,
they realize like, wow,
7127.99 now I'm applying all those mechanisms
7129.78 of trying to understand truth and to that,
7132.43 and what I see is that it's
true and wow, it's true.
7135.99 Like, I mean, we hear that
all the time, which tells me,
7138.46 hey, something different
is going on there.
7141.12 And of course these are powerful tools
7142.76 so misused like very
bad things can happen.
7145.33 But you think about the clinical
utility and what does it
7147.87 mean that so many people
change for the healthier
7151.99 or even change their
lives after an experience
7155.52 because it so resonates as like,
7157.32 oh, now I understand
something that's true.
7159.2 And it's not something bizarre.
7160.69 It's like,
7161.523 I wasn't responsible for
being raped that time
7163.53 or I'm not less than even
though my sexuality or my gender
7167.973 identity's different from some
silly binary concept, right?
7171.56 Like people kind of often
get it and they feel
7173.58 differently about themselves
7174.76 and guilt and shame are impacted.
7176.66 So I think we're likely to
see that they are powerful
7179.598 anti-trauma mechanisms again,
7182.66 used clinically in the right hands.
7185.52 And I think that we're also going
to see that they're heuristic
7187.64 for understanding our brain
that goes against what I see
7190.77 as some of the reflexive hubris of,
7193.25 well, the outer parts must be the best
7195.761 because that's what makes
7196.594 us human and other animals don't have it.
7198.04 And we're better because we're human.
7199.3 I mean, it makes no sense, you know?
7201.13 - I'd like to talk about MDMA
7203.82 and I'll preface this by saying
7205.09 I was a participant actually,
7206.79 technically I'm still a
participant in a clinical trial.
7209.63 So I have experience of doing it twice
7213.934 at the trial involves three
separate dosings of this.
7218.26 I was reluctant to do it
outside of a clinical trial,
7221.37 mostly because I was aware
7223.67 there can be some cardiac effects.
7225.31 And I liked the idea there
would be a clinician on hand.
7227.41 And I'll just say that
I found the experiences
7231.17 to be profound, beneficial
and very different
7236.945 from one session to the next.
7239.11 The first one felt
7243.14 a whole collection
7244.54 of ideas and relational
things came up that felt very
7248.43 powerful and transformative.
7249.77 And I do think that I learned there,
7251.9 I exported a number of things,
7253.87 my particular experience
isn't relevant here,
7256.09 but the second time I expected
it to be the same way.
7259.01 And it was very mellow and relaxing
7264.427 and was deeply tied to kind
of notions of acceptance.
7267.56 So there weren't all these
revelations and wow new insights.
7271.23 It was very much about sort of grounding
7273.86 into a kind of a calmer state.
7276.53 So I have the personal experience
7278.9 of benefiting from these in
ways that I think still benefit
7281.68 me and was very struck
by the power of MDMA.
7285.47 And my very crude understanding
of the pharmacology
7288.82 and the state that is being under MDMA
7291.14 is that it encourages or increases
7293.55 dopaminergic transmission,
7295.27 but also serotonergic transmission.
7296.827 - Yeah.
7297.66 - Which is to my knowledge,
7298.6 a kind of a rare state
for the brain to be in
7301.32 that typically it's more
of a seesaw dopaminergic
7304.17 drive towards external goals
7306.17 or more serotonergic drive towards
7309.24 more plasticity or comfort
with what one already has.
7312.47 And so with both those systems amplified,
7315.02 the only way I can describe
it subjectively is that it,
7317.27 everything sort of funneled back in,
7318.61 and it was almost like a
pursuit of inner landscape.
7324.35 And I can only imagine what it
would be like in the context
7327.38 of doing this with somebody
else also taking MDMA.
7331.62 I have no idea what that's like.
7333.64 That's my report of the experience.
7336.24 I know that the experience can vary.
7338.823 What are your thoughts about the chemistry
7340.77 and what sorts of states
7342.92 do you think MDMA is creating
7346.15 that can explain why it's
a useful therapeutic tool
7349.47 in some cases and what sorts
of cases those might be.
7352.97 - Sure, sure.
7355.29 To clarify, I think part
of what we're starting
7358.606 with is this is very different
than the psychedelics, right?
7360.87 Which are seeding our
consciousness in these deep centers
7363.41 of the brain, right?
7364.52 Whereas what MDMA is
doing is sort of flooding
7368.11 with positive neurotransmitters, right?
7370.48 In certain parts of the brain.
7371.82 And I think what that creates
is a greater permissiveness
7375.46 inside to entertain or approach
different things, right?
7380.94 So I think where we see it's tremend,
7383.77 my read of the data is around potentially
7386.25 and we're seeing in some
of the trials, right?
7387.94 Tremendous benefit for trauma, right?
7390.86 And you think about what we
were talking about earlier,
7392.5 how this reflexive, guilt, shame,
7394.85 hypervigilance, avoidance, right?
7398.201 And when these systems
7399.034 are flooded with these neurotransmitters,
7401.51 it's more permissive to sort
of think about that, right?
7403.657 And to think about that without again,
7405.58 all the chatter of that's your fault,
7407.85 or you're never going to get
anywhere because of that,
7410.078 or you know what that means, right?
7411.49 They could kind of go away
and then we can think about it
7413.64 in a way that isn't through
the lens of fear, right?
7416.8 And I think that's,
7418.14 the power there is that
7420.236 it's permissive of approaching something,
7422.36 contemplating something,
7425.17 a different, a novelty as we
talk about a de novo approach.
7428.6 And I think that's also why the experience
7431.01 can vary because you could also see how,
7434.06 if you're not thinking
about something, right?
7436.65 So there's not a clinical guidance to it,
7439.26 you could be in a state where like,
7441.835 hey, I just feel good, right?
7442.668 And I'm thinking about good things.
7444.47 And like, that can feel good, right?
7446.155 But it, but that's not necessarily
problem solving, right?
7449.53 So the clinical guidance says,
7451.24 hey, let's take that state and
do something with it, right?
7454.86 Let's Now that you're in this state,
7456.489 let's make hay while the
sun is shinning, right?
7459.608 You're in a state where we can look
7461.13 at things that are traumatic, right?
7462.89 We can approach them from
a de novo perspective.
7465.8 And I think it's part,
7466.81 I think that explains why
you had these different
7468.54 experiences from one to the other,
7470.5 because your brain is just in a state
7472.06 that's conducive to something, right?
7474.17 But if there's not
7475.45 the mechanism to have that thing happen,
7477.7 like conducive to something therapeutic,
7479.74 then you might go there on your own.
7481.41 Or you might just be in a state
7483.26 where you have a sense of wellbeing
7485.3 and you sit with that.
7486.64 - Which sort of seems like a waste to me.
7488.35 I mean, this is what I tell
people when they ask about MDMA.
7491.98 I said, at least from my experience
7493.53 that the potential hazard
there is that in that very high
7497.14 dopaminergic, serotonergic state,
7500.25 there were moments where I
felt like I could get excited
7502.45 about any one specific concept
that I might even just think
7506.25 about, for instance,
7508.13 water and how nourishing it is,
7509.8 and really just go down the path of water
7512.3 and the world and all
the water and you can,
7514.66 you're in a state that is
very prone to suggestion.
7519.17 - [Paul] Yes.
7520.003 - Internal suggestion.
7520.9 And so the guidance turned out,
7522.31 the guidance from the clinician
turned out to be immensely
7524.44 valuable in allowing me
to go into my own heads
7528.05 for bits of time, but
then also to resurface
7530.55 and share and exchange in a way to,
7533.57 I'm trying really get something out of it
7535.57 that was useful and that I could export
7537.16 because of course water is wonderful,
7538.43 but I'm not really interested in growing
7539.87 my relationship to water.
7541.69 - [Paul] Yes.
7542.57 And I really felt like in,
I could understand for the,
7544.61 I never went to raves
or anything growing up.
7546.65 I never did MDMA recreationally,
7549.549 but I understood for the first time
7550.44 how people could get really
7551.7 attached to an environment
and feel connected to things.
7554.17 Because I think with all that serotonin,
7556.02 you just feel connected
to everything around you.
7558.5 So I think it's a slippery slope there.
7561.015 - Yes.
7561.848 - And I don't know what the future
7563.03 of the clinical use of MDMA looks like,
7565.61 but I would hope that whoever's thinking
7567.46 about I'm guiding these sessions
7569.82 is really thinking carefully,
7571.15 also about evolving the practice
7572.71 to help people really move through
7575.59 in a sequential way
7576.423 so they can leave with something valuable.
7578.9 - Yes, 100%, 100%.
7581.31 These are such powerful tools.
7583.71 And again, if they're powerful tools
7585.17 and we're using them without
respect for them, right?
7589.76 Without clinical guidance,
we incur risk, right?
7592.33 I mean, you know,
7593.18 getting obsessed with water
while it probably isn't going to
7595.84 hurt you, right?
7596.94 But if someone is out using it,
they're around other people,
7600.77 what one can feel positively about
7603.05 or become sort of obsessed
in the short term about
7604.92 can be very counterproductive, right?
7606.31 It can be a lot of risk to that.
7607.59 So I think it anchors back to
these are very powerful tools.
7612.37 We're coming to understand
them much, much more.
7614.9 And we're coming to understand
that they have immense
7617.01 potential to be helpful to us.
7619.25 But I think and hope that
that only also increases
7623.22 our respect for those
modalities and what can come,
7628.43 what negative can happen
if we're not respectful.
7631.86 - It's going to be very interesting
7633.06 to see where all of this goes
7634.61 in the next few years, not
just in Oregon, but elsewhere.
7637.022 One way or another it's happening.
7639.04 It seems to have a momentum
that is not going to stop.
7642.18 So very exciting area to be sure.
7645.7 - I agree.
7647.17 - I have a question about language.
7649.67 In your book,
7650.503 you talk about how we need to be careful
7652.82 about the use of language around trauma.
7654.708 - [Paul] Yes.
7655.541 - Maybe problem solving and
problem describing in general.
7659.939 At one extreme,
7660.94 you hear that your
brain and your body hear
7664.23 every word you say, and, you know,
7666.85 we have to be so careful with language.
7669.88 And that actually frightened
me for a number of years,
7671.81 'cause I would hear that
and I thought, gosh,
7673.08 if I just think that something is bad
7674.74 now it's going to hurt me worse,
7676.2 which itself is part of that whole,
7678.09 packing down of an issue.
7680.91 Very hard to avoid thoughts
without distraction.
7684.94 - [Paul] Yes.
7685.941 - So that's one extreme,
on the other hand,
7689.02 I can say, I can tell somebody,
7692.79 I love them with a tone of hatred.
7695.87 I can tell somebody I hate
them with a tone of love.
7698.23 - [Paul] Yes.
7699.964 - So how should we think about
language in parsing trauma?
7703.43 And in your book you talk about,
7705.29 you give some cautionary notes
7706.64 about talking about depression, trauma
7709.197 and PTSD in terms that that might diminish
7712.91 their real severity in some cases.
7717.91 And I was really struck by that.
7719.37 So maybe just touch on
7720.77 how should we talk about these
things in a way that doesn't
7724.45 diminish them for ourselves
or for other people.
7728.162 And at the same time honors the fact
7729.46 that there's a lot of trauma out there.
7731.113 - [Paul] Right
7732.452 - And there's a lot of
depression out there
7733.81 and we need to talk about it.
7735.74 - Yeah.
7736.573 I think this a very complicated
7738.76 and in many ways convoluted topic,
7740.56 like I think it's wonderful
that we have language,
7743.07 but boy, language leads
us astray often too.
7746.84 You think about how we,
7748.06 how people define words?
7749.749 Someone says a word, what is it?
7750.92 Does that person know
what that word means?
7753.5 What nuance are they taking from? it
7755.28 We just have to be very
careful what we're saying
7758.73 and what we're communicating.
7760.4 And I think this doesn't mean because,
7762.58 there's a sort of phenomenon now
7765.14 where people are trying
to control language
7767.19 I think too much,
7768.023 like you can't say anything
that someone else might find
7770.12 hurtful or you have to refer to people
7772.28 in ways they choose to be referred to,
7774.15 even if those are ways that
others don't understand,
7777.25 or ways they themselves have
decided or ways that might be
7781.28 psychologically or clinically unhelpful.
7783.8 So I think the over control
of language is not good,
7787.8 but I think the specificity of language
7789.93 of what are we trying to
say, how are we defining it?
7792.71 Or even the word trauma, right?
7793.543 We're talking about trauma.
7794.78 So we want to define
what that means, right?
7796.71 It doesn't just mean like,
7797.92 oh, anything kind of negative, right?
7799.66 Because then that dilutes it
down to meaning nothing, right?
7802.64 It also doesn't just mean,
7806.33 injury and combat, right?
7807.73 Like we have to talk about what that is.
7809.5 So I think anchoring it
to something that rises
7811.79 to the magnitude of
overwhelming our coping skills
7813.96 and changing us,
7815.05 like then at least I define
it that way and I can
7817.43 communicate that to you
and we can understand
7820.16 what we're talking about, right?
7821.67 I think that another aspect
of language, while again,
7824.58 we need this middle ground and
I don't think that it is okay
7828.63 for the over control of language
to shut down expression,
7832.51 but we also have to acknowledge,
7835.26 how we're so much less
distanced from each other
7838.05 through social media.
7839.3 And I think social media can do very,
7841.15 very good things as hopefully
we're doing now, right?
7844.0 But it can also be used to harm people
7847.12 from a distance, right?
7848.32 And how much hatefulness
is there out there
7852.03 that I think comes from anger
7853.28 and frustration in people,
7854.58 back to trauma, right?
7856.01 Where people just want to be angry
7857.62 and it's not really issues
that they're talking about,
7860.14 but then there's a target of that anger
7864.177 and people feel beleaguered by that.
7866.978 And the words that people use sometimes
7869.27 are so awful that someone reading that,
7871.89 like if you're in the demographic
7873.27 that's being targeted, right?
7874.99 And you're reading that, I mean,
7876.02 how does a person not feel, not feel,
7880.22 be set upon vulnerable, right?
7882.31 And then I think that also fuels,
7884.17 things like we just had this
7886.04 terrible shooting in Buffalo, right?
7887.64 Like just hate motivated, right?
7889.82 And I think that,
7891.13 because that kind of language
becomes very real to people
7893.61 who may take it in,
7894.53 it fuels their hate and then
they do something to enact it,
7897.69 which of course creates greater feel
7899.6 and fear and vulnerability.
7901.39 And I think there was
some civility and decorum
7904.76 that was in our world,
not that long ago, right?
7907.81 I mean, you know, I'm in my early fifties,
7909.43 I'm not that old, right?
7910.83 But I remember a time
7912.33 when in political discourse,
7914.16 say people were civil
to one another, right?
7916.96 Now so much, I mean, it's
not all of it, right?
7920.08 But there's an acceptance of things
7921.56 that are just bombastic, right?
7923.67 It's a circus side show sometimes
7926.771 of people being just angry and aggressive
7930.29 and it's not really linked to anything,
7931.88 although it's allegedly
linked to something,
7933.43 but then other people's
anger can attach to it.
7935.91 And it's not about what it's about,
7937.26 but it's about aligning with the anger
7940.107 and I think that there is so much damage
7944.39 that comes from that.
7945.37 And I think, should we have,
7948.24 should it be okay that
people sometimes are talking,
7951.97 communicating, using language in ways
7954.11 that would like get us suspended
from middle school, right?
7957.34 Ways I don't want my
eight year old to see,
7959.7 I mean, is that really okay?
7961.77 Or do we need to take a stand
7963.65 for like rational use of language?
7965.15 I don't want my use of
language to be over controlled
7967.87 by someone who thinks
they sort of understand
7969.71 better than the rest of us
how to communicate with us.
7972.49 Okay, I don't want that.
7973.36 What's stereotypically
7974.45 a sort of idea of the left say, right?
7977.53 At least in our society,
but I also don't want,
7981.54 language, it can be so angry
7983.67 and so aggressive that it is perpetuating
7987.56 or spreading vulnerability and
that it facilitates trauma.
7992.03 And I think we could set
standards as a society
7995.28 where we say, look, I
don't want anybody in power
7998.06 who's going to behave that way, right?
7999.6 I don't care if their
whole agenda is like,
8001.38 make Paul Conti's life better.
8002.99 I'm still not going to
vote for you, right?
8005.07 If you're behaving towards others
8006.79 in a way that's denigrating,
8008.09 you're behaving in a way that I feel
8010.11 essentially ashamed of, right?
8011.98 And I feel that a lot, right?
8013.15 I see the politics, you
know, I see things play out.
8016.2 It's not always political, of
course not always political,
8018.59 but I see things play out
and I think, oh my gosh,
8020.84 I feel embarrassed.
8021.8 Like we we're somehow okay with this.
8023.58 Well, it doesn't matter which side
8025.731 of the political spectrum it's coming to.
8027.44 And I think that's an
indicator that what we're doing
8031.06 is really hurtful to us.
8034.07 People become more angry.
8035.45 They attach to the anger.
8037.62 People feel more beleaguered.
8039.07 There's more divisions between us.
8040.57 And it seems more and more like,
8041.81 well, we can only really
identify with people
8044.28 who are just like us
8045.3 and like, what does that really mean?
8046.35 I mean, the divisions
that it creates between us
8049.34 and that promotes so many
negative things, right?
8053.61 I mean, think about ways
in which it promotes
8054.844 white supremacy, right?
8056.602 It's just one example, right?
8057.74 And we've seen that play out
that this is really bad for us.
8062.575 And we've got to look at that.
8063.443 I mean, if we don't look at that,
8066.23 I don't think something
is going to happen.
8068.16 Like something is happening, right?
8069.7 It's happening now.
8071.04 - Yeah, and I'm, it really, to my mind,
8073.82 it really seeps down into the soil
8075.82 of everything that we're talking about.
8077.007 - Yes.
8078.09 - On all sides.
8079.17 - [Paul] Yes.
8080.003 - People are activated.
8081.33 People are upset about
one thing or the other.
8085.38 - Right.
8086.213 - No one is immune from upset
8087.89 regardless of political affiliation.
8090.014 - [Paul] Right.
8090.847 - Everybody seems to be upset nowadays.
8092.938 - [Paul] Right.
8093.85 - As I was hearing you talk about this,
8096.098 I feel a lot of resonance
with what you said
8098.8 and I also am hoping you run for office.
8102.385 - Thank you.
8103.771 I don't think I have the gumption for that
8105.63 but thank you for.
8106.463 - [Andrew] Well, that would be wonderful.
8108.05 - Thank you.
8109.2 I'd like to talk about a concept
8112.524 of taking care of one's self.
8114.02 This comes up in the book.
8115.69 - [Paul] Yes.
8116.637 - This is something we talk
a lot about on this podcast.
8118.25 I mean, I think people have
heard me blab endlessly,
8120.37 and I'll probably go into the grave
8122.82 telling people to get sunlight
in their eyes when they can
8125.13 and to try and get proper
sleep and to have a few tools
8130.44 for reducing their anxiety in real time
8132.3 and on and on and on.
8133.542 - [Paul] Right.
8135.15 - We hear about this concept
of taking care of oneself
8138.01 and I think at a surface level,
8141.3 it can sound a little bit
light, you know, oh, take care,
8144.46 take care, take good care.
8147.6 But to me it's a deep
and powerful concept.
8149.94 - [Paul] Yes.
8150.773 - And I was very happy
to see it in your book
8153.0 and also to learn a lot of ideas
8156.44 about what that really looks like,
8159.78 because whether or not
somebody is in the early stages
8162.08 of considering whether
or not they have trauma
8164.27 or is in the deep stages of working
8165.82 that through or has made
it through the tunnel
8168.16 some distance taking care of oneself
8171.02 is an ongoing process.
8172.64 - [Paul] Yes.
8175.02 - I'd love for you to just describe
8177.02 what taking care of oneself
means to you as a clinician.
8182.413 And of course the practices and things
8183.72 that you encourage people to do.
8186.456 But how should we think about taking care
8188.32 of oneself because on one extreme,
8190.23 you could imagine massages
or treats vacations
8195.228 and chefs for hire that
take care of everything
8197.56 for ourselves.
8199.41 And on the other extreme, you could say,
8202.8 leaning into life in a way
that you're paying attention
8205.65 to small things while
working very, very hard.
8209.31 So it's such a big concept,
8211.69 how do you think about
taking care of one's self?
8213.47 How should I take care of myself?
8215.095 - [Paul] Sure.
8215.928 - How should people
take care of themselves?
8216.96 - Sure.
8217.88 - I see here, what I think
8219.82 is a very fascinating dichotomy, right?
8221.96 That in some ways, like,
8223.3 think about how complex
our brains are, right?
8225.68 How complex our psyches,
our unconscious minds are.
8228.38 There's so much complexity
there, but on the other hand,
8232.88 psychological concepts that are consistent
8235.2 with health are often very simple, right?
8238.9 Which I don't mean light, right?
8242.313 But simple, straightforward, right?
8243.96 And I think self-care is
absolutely one of them.
8246.59 I mean, how much is talked about,
8247.98 how to take care of one self
8249.5 that just skips over the basics
8251.36 that are necessary as a
building block for all else.
8253.73 So it doesn't matter how many
chefs or vacations or whatever
8256.473 a person has if the basics of
self-care aren't squared away.
8261.09 And it's not a light concept to say like,
8263.767 are you sleeping enough, right?
8266.34 Are you eating well?
8268.421 Are you getting natural light?
8269.51 Are you interacting with people
8271.07 who are good to interact with, right?
8273.01 Are you accepting negative
interactions in your life?
8276.45 Are you living in circumstances
8277.91 that make you feel okay or not?
8280.43 They're very basic premises,
8283.95 but so often we're not
looking at them at all, right?
8287.76 We're not looking at them at
all because we tend to skip
8291.01 over them and we tend to
skip over them either,
8294.22 because, again, in some automatic way
8296.36 that sometimes is trauma driven
8298.13 or we're not going to look at that, right?
8300.17 And often not taking care of ourselves
8301.94 can have the punishment
distraction, right?
8304.48 There's so much that can come into that.
8307.03 Or our sense of power is,
8309.45 is tied to not taking care of ourselves.
8311.44 I mean, I'll give you
an example is I tend to,
8314.14 for whatever reason do reasonably well
8317.22 with very poor self care, right?
8319.28 And like, that was very adaptive
8321.29 when I was into medical training, right?
8323.639 And I'm like, okay, I can eat a lot today.
8325.62 I can not eat, right?
8326.56 I can sleep two hours.
8327.77 I can sleep eight, right?
8329.85 I mean, overall, that's not good.
8331.73 And it hasn't been good
for me as I've aged.
8334.34 But then I realized some look,
8335.98 I'm doing all these things
to make myself healthier,
8338.06 but like what, I ignored that, right?
8340.25 And why am I ignoring it?
8341.083 That was a key question.
8341.916 Why am I ignoring it?
8343.14 Because somewhere inside of me, as it was,
8345.21 and still to some extent is,
8347.26 this idea that my ability to
be really functional, right?
8350.44 To generate success in the world around me
8353.02 is tied to my ability to do that, right?
8355.64 That, oh, but if I stop
doing that and now I'm like,
8358.1 I'm eating and sleeping regularly,
8359.66 then I'm going to lose some edge.
8361.47 So even I think about this all the time,
8363.7 but I realize,
8365.02 hey, I'm also, I'm not
doing it inside, you know?
8368.315 And I think it's really grounding
8370.24 to the basics that really help us of like,
8373.48 what are the basics of what I'm doing
8375.22 and not doing in my life, diet, exercise,
8377.34 sleep, people, circumstances,
8379.95 leisure activities.
8380.783 I mean, sunlight.
8383.651 I think immensely important
and dramatically undervalued.
8387.16 - Well, I want to thank you for that.
8388.45 And I want to thank you
for today's discussion.
8391.54 I found it to be incredibly informative
8394.28 and I know our listeners will also.
8396.553 I also want to thank
you for the work you do.
8398.65 I mean, you obviously run an incredibly
8401.34 robust clinical practice
8402.95 that I'm aware that you're
constantly trying to improve,
8405.68 even though it's operating at
the highest levels already.
8408.51 - I appreciate that.
8409.72 - I really, the reason
why you're here today
8412.69 is because I've done
a wide and deep search
8415.51 for people in these areas.
8419.315 And there are so few who have
the background in medical
8423.23 training and physiology,
8424.94 in the psychoanalytic
and psychiatric realm
8428.21 and also have a grounding
toward the future,
8432.2 of what's coming and who can encapsulate
8435.11 so many different orientations
8436.89 and bring them together
into a coherent piece.
8439.57 So I really thank you.
8441.668 - I so appreciate that.
8442.64 - Yeah, and for your
book, which is incredible,
8445.6 I will go on record saying,
8448.26 I think this is the
definitive book on trauma.
8450.99 - Wow, thank you.
8451.823 - And I really encourage people
8452.7 to read it and will continue
to encourage people to read it.
8455.69 It has so many valuable takeaways
8457.7 and insights and tools there.
8459.82 So on behalf of the listeners and myself,
8463.36 thank you so much for joining us today.
8465.97 - You're very welcome.
8466.87 And I take that to heart
and I'm very appreciative
8469.87 of being here, so you're very welcome
8471.35 and thank you as well.
8472.271 - Thank you.
8473.77 Thank you for joining me
8474.65 for my discussion with Dr. Paul Conti.
8476.94 I also highly recommend that
you explore his new book,
8480.47 which is "Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic,
8482.89 How Trauma Works and How
We Can Heal From It."
8485.48 It's an exceptional resource,
8486.83 both for those that have trauma
8488.27 and those that don't have trauma
8490.45 or those that suspect
they might have trauma.
8493.35 Again, it's a deep dive
into what trauma is
8496.09 and offers many simple
tools that anyone can apply
8499.32 with a therapist or not, in
order to heal from trauma.
8503.1 And if you'd like to

8504.99 and the work he does
directly with patients,

8549.66 Not so much in today's episode,
8551.06 but in many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
8553.91 we discuss supplements.
8555.57 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
8557.93 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them,
8560.34 for things like improving
the transition time
8562.79 and the depth of sleep each night,
8564.6 for improving focus, for managing anxiety
8567.48 and for many other
aspects of mental health,
8569.41 physical health and performance.
8571.4 For that reason,
8572.233 the Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered
8573.21 with Momentous supplements
because first off,
8576.64 they are of the very highest quality.
8578.6 They also ship internationally,
8580.47 which many other supplement
companies do not.
8583.07 And we wanted to have a one
stop location where people could
8586.38 find and access the
supplements that are discussed
8589.06 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
8590.65 So if you go to
livemomentous.com/huberman,
8594.0 you'll find many of the
supplements that are commonly
8596.47 discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
8598.37 I should just mention that the
catalog of supplements there
8601.27 will be expanding in the
weeks and months to follow,
8603.77 but already a number of them for sleep
8605.76 and focus and other
aspects of mental health,
8607.64 physical health and performance
8608.85 are already there at
livemomentous.com/huberman.
8612.45 If you're not already following
Huberman Lab on Instagram
8615.07 and Twitter, please do so.
8616.81 There I cover science
and science based tools,
8619.013 some of which overlaps with the content
8620.97 to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
8622.2 but much of which is distinct
from the information covered
8624.35 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
8626.77 We also have a newsletter
8627.98 called the Neural Network Newsletter,
8629.94 where we offer distilled information.
8632.1 So lists of protocols
8633.3 and key takeaways from podcast episodes.
8635.65 If you want to sign up for the newsletter,
8637.47 all it requires is your email.
8638.98 Please know that we do not
share your email with anybody.
8641.44 We have a very clear privacy policy.
8643.54 You can find all that by
going to hubermanlab.com.
8646.19 There's a menu there where you can sign up
8648.7 for the Neural Network Newsletter.
8650.01 You can also immediately get access
8652.36 to some example newsletters.
8653.9 So you know what the
newsletter is all about.
8656.49 So thank you once again for
joining me for my discussion
8658.86 with Dr. Paul Conti and last,
8661.0 but certainly not least,
8662.62 thank you for your interest in science.
