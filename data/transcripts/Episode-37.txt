0.36 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.28 where we discuss science
3.72 and science-based tools for everyday life.
5.766 [upbeat music]
9.36 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.38 and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
13.29 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.27 Today, my guest is Ido Portal.
17.61 Ido Portal is somebody who
truly defies formal definition.
21.93 He is, however, accredited by many
23.82 to be the world expert
in all things movement.
27.3 Movement is one of the more fascinating
29.1 and important aspects
of our nervous system.
31.5 In fact, it was the great
Nobel Prize winner Sherrington
34.71 that said, "Movement is
the final common path."
37.38 And what he was referring to is the fact
39.81 that so much of our nervous
system is dedicated to movement
43.05 and, in particular, that
the human nervous system
45.72 can generate the greatest
variety of forms of movement.
49.29 We can run, we can jump, we can crawl,
51.27 we can move at different speeds.
53.04 Far more variation in movement
55.41 and different types and speeds of movement
57.18 than any other animal in the
animal kingdom can perform.
61.53 My interest in bringing Ido
Portal onto this podcast
63.87 stemmed from a discussion about just that,
65.94 about Sherrington and the
enormous range of movements
68.79 that humans can engage in.
70.23 Ido is both a practitioner
and an intellectual.
73.53 We all know what a practitioner is,
74.97 it's somebody who walks the walk,
76.32 who actually performs the thing
78.3 that they are knowledgeable about.
80.34 And indeed, Ido has studied capoeira,
83.31 a number of other martial arts,
84.63 dance, gymnastics, various forms of sport,
87.48 he's trained top athletes
like Conor McGregor,
90.24 and he has many, many
other credits to his name
92.76 as a practitioner and teacher.
95.16 However, he is also a true
intellectual of movement.
98.94 I define an intellectual as somebody
101.13 who can both think about
and talk about a subject
104.31 at multiple levels of granularity
106.41 that is with exquisite detail
108.51 and with exquisite simplicity
depending on their audience
111.96 and depending on the topic at hand.
113.61 And as you'll soon hear
from my discussion with Ido,
116.31 he is both a practitioner
and a true intellectual
120.06 of all things movement.
121.53 Today, through our discussion,
123.12 you will learn how the nervous
system generates movement,
126.12 and the different forms of movement,
127.47 the different speeds of movement.
129.0 You're also going to get
an incredible insight
131.25 through Ido's mind and eyes
of how movement can serve us
135.6 in the various context of life.
137.7 Not just in sport, not just in exercise,
140.49 but in every aspect of our lives
142.83 from the time we get up in the morning
144.24 until the time we go to sleep at night,
146.19 how we engage with others,
how we engage with ourselves,
148.98 indeed, how movement even informs
151.02 relationships of different kinds.
153.54 I found our discussion to be
one of the most enlightening
156.66 and interesting discussions
that I've ever had,
158.76 not just about movement, but
about the nervous system.
162.12 I can assure you that by
the end of this episode,
164.52 you will not only learn a
tremendous amount about movement
167.85 through the eyes and mind of
the one and only Ido Portal,
171.39 but you also will learn a
tremendous amount of neuroscience
174.99 about how the cells, and
circuits, and hormones,
177.3 and neurotransmitters of your body
179.04 assist in creating the
various forms of movement
181.653 that you can generate,
183.03 that you're trying to learn and generate,
185.04 and that perhaps you should think about
187.26 trying to learn and generate.
188.88 And indeed, you'll learn
some protocols and tools
190.89 for how to do that.
192.0 In science, we have a phrase,
193.59 actually it's a title,
194.82 that's reserved for only
the rarest of individuals,
198.33 we say that somebody is an n-of-1,
201.03 meaning a sample size of one.
202.95 And as you'll soon learn,
204.54 Ido Portal is truly an n-of-1.
207.36 Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast
209.88 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
212.49 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
214.41 to bring zero-cost to consumer information
216.27 about science and science-related tools
218.04 to the general public.
219.39 In keeping with that theme,
220.44 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
223.11 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
225.27 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
226.74 vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink
228.63 that also has adaptogens
and digestive enzymes.
231.54 I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012,
234.297 and so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.
236.7 In fact, when people ask me,
237.547 "What's the one supplement
they should take?"
239.79 I always say, "Athletic Greens
241.14 because it covers all of those
essential nutritional bases
244.59 and the probiotics, adaptogens,
and digestive enzymes
247.86 are vital for things
like the gut microbiome."
249.99 Your gut microbiome is trillions
of little microbacteria
253.44 that live in your gut, and that
support your immune system,
255.66 your endocrine system, and
the so-called gut-brain axis,
258.3 which is important for mood and
neurotransmitter production,
260.97 a huge number of biological
systems in your brain and body.
264.57 Athletic Greens also taste great.
266.01 I mix mine with water
267.33 and I like a little bit of lemon juice
268.59 or lime juice in there.
269.52 As I mentioned, I drink it twice a day,
271.29 usually once in the morning,
272.67 during the phase of the day
in which typically I'm fasting
275.01 or around breakfast time,
276.09 and then again in the afternoon
or even in the evening.
278.37 If you like to try Athletic Greens,
279.66 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
282.33 to claim a special offer.
283.8 They'll give you five free travel packs,
285.45 which make it very easy
to mix up Athletic Greens
287.64 while you're on the road.
289.23 And they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3, K2.
292.71 Vitamin D3 and K2 are
important for endocrine health,
296.64 for cardiovascular health,
297.9 for calcium regulation, and so on.
300.24 Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
302.82 to claim this special offer.
304.41 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
307.069 ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses,
308.91 they're the absolute highest
quality and practicality.
312.54 I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system,
314.64 and I can tell you that your visual system
315.99 has to contend with an
enormous number of challenges.
318.06 For instance, when you
move from a shady area
319.98 to a bright area, your
eyes have to adapt to that.
322.86 ROKA understands the various challenges
324.66 that the visual system has to face
326.01 and they've developed
sunglasses and eyeglasses
328.41 with all of that biology in mind.
330.81 Their glasses were developed
331.89 by two All-American
swimmers from Stanford.
334.14 And initially, ROKA
sunglasses and eyeglasses
336.54 were for athletes.
338.25 They designed eyeglasses
that then and still now
340.92 will stay on your face if you get sweaty.
342.45 You can wear them running,
343.47 you can wear them cycling, et cetera.
344.85 They're very lightweight,
345.78 so lightweight in fact
that most of the time
347.13 you don't even remember
that they're on your face.
349.11 But ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses
350.76 also come in a terrific aesthetic
352.29 so you can wear them anywhere.
353.43 So, unlike a lot of so-called
performance glasses out there
355.59 that make people look like cyborgs,
357.3 you can wear ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses
359.34 when exercising, to dinner, to work.
361.86 Again, the aesthetics are really terrific
363.66 and really adaptable to all
those different environments.
365.94 If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,
367.47 you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com,
370.17 and enter the code HUBERMAN to
get 20% off your first order.
373.59 Again, that's roka.com,
375.51 enter the code HUBERMAN at checkout.
377.58 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.
380.25 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
382.38 that are customized to your sleep needs.
385.26 I've talked a lot on this podcast,
386.697 and on another podcast,
and on social media
388.71 about the essential need for sleep.
390.78 Put simply, sleep is the
foundation of all mental health,
393.75 physical health, and performance.
395.79 Just a few nights or even
one night's poor sleep
397.86 can really hinder your mental health,
399.63 physical health, and performance
in all aspects of life.
403.14 Helix has customized sleep products,
406.02 that is mattresses and
pillows that are designed
408.27 to your sleep needs.
409.38 And you can figure out
what those sleep needs
410.73 are very easily by going
to the helix website,
413.1 they have a quiz, it takes
just about two minutes,
415.08 and ask you questions like
do you sleep on your back,
417.27 your side, or your stomach?
418.14 Do you tend to run hot or
cold during sleep, et cetera?
420.57 Or maybe you don't even know
the answers to those questions,
422.31 that's fine too,
423.143 that's an option that
you can answer as well.
426.03 You take the brief two-minute quiz
427.53 and then Helix will match you
429.15 to the ideal mattress and pillow for you.
431.52 I matched to the so-called Dusk Mattress.
434.22 I started sleeping on that
well over a year ago now,
436.41 and it's the best sleep I've ever had.
437.91 I'm sleeping much longer and much better
441.51 through the entire night.
442.59 And as a consequence,
I'm feeling much better,
444.33 more clear, more physically
alert, et cetera,
446.67 throughout the day.
447.81 If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,
449.4 go to helixsleep.com/huberman.
451.89 You can take that two-minute quiz
452.97 and they'll match you to a
customized mattress for you,
454.92 and you'll get up to $200
off all mattress orders
457.92 and two free pillows.
459.39 Again, if you're interested,
460.223 you go to helixsleep.com/huberman
462.48 for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
465.3 And now, for my discussion
with Ido Portal.
468.6 Ido, thank you for coming here today.
471.78 I've been looking forward
to sitting down with you
473.49 to talk for a very long time.
475.8 I was first exposed to your work
478.53 from my post or a podcast I believe
482.22 of you had a group of people
walking down handrails,
486.3 literally the handrails along stairwells.
488.22 And as a, I don't want to
say former skateboarder,
490.89 once a skateboarder,
always a skateboarder.
493.08 As a skateboarder, handrails
have a particular meaning,
496.62 but I was really struck by, first of all,
501.21 the incredible range of
skill that people had
504.27 and yet their willingness to do this.
507.48 Right, I think of handrails
and walking on handrails
509.79 or skateboarding on handrails
as a potential hazard,
512.25 and yet some of the incredible proficiency
515.43 that some of the people
there including yourself had.
517.53 So, like many people, I
was drawn to your practice
520.077 and your work initially
through a wide-eyed, "Wow."
523.32 You know, they're doing
some incredible stuff
524.97 on natural objects,
526.32 much as skateboarders or parkour folks do.
529.14 But over the years, we've
been in communication
532.2 and I've come to realize that
you're a true intellectual
535.65 of the topic of movement.
537.36 And I define it intellectual
538.65 as somebody who can understand a topic
540.69 at multiple levels of granularity,
542.94 detail, general, specific,
connections, et cetera.
546.57 So, to start off,
550.11 could you share with us your conception
553.29 of this idea of movement?
555.72 You know, obviously movement
557.88 involves translation through space,
560.85 but when you talk about
a movement practice,
563.91 what are you really thinking about?
565.74 What are we talking about
566.82 when we talk about a movement practice?
570.63 - It's a big question.
574.08 I somehow left the definition,
578.88 the very tight definition
of it out for myself
583.89 because I felt it was
starting to constrict me
586.41 and be around me
587.243 and I let the practice
itself really define it.
591.48 But I think part of
our sense of everything
595.95 is actually a sense of movement
598.35 and then the stillness in
the background of that.
602.37 So, for me, this is the entity
that I refer to as movement,
606.57 and using that perspective for
self-evolution development,
612.84 of course, the physical side,
614.61 but also movement of emotions,
616.35 movement of thoughts, and
any other movement streams.
621.81 And by switching these layers
624.21 and examining it from different places,
626.25 you get a better and better sense of it.
629.85 I think the visuals nowadays and media
632.58 are what defines for people
in the beginning things.
636.24 And then little by little with experience,
638.1 they can dive deeper, which is good.
640.26 There is some aspect, sexy
aspect or not so sexy aspect,
645.09 and then you pull on it
and you start to examine
648.15 and dive deeper, and then
you receive the gift of it,
653.79 finding out more.
656.01 - I heard you say once
656.97 that we are not just a brain with a body,
659.19 but we are a body with a brain,
662.07 which I absolutely love
because as a student
665.28 and a researcher of the nervous system,
667.41 I never think about the brain
as its own isolated thing,
670.77 I think about the nervous system
671.603 and the fact that the
brain and the spinal cord
673.83 are connected to the body,
674.663 and the body is connected
to this, to the brain.
677.787 And in every direction,
679.29 it's everything truly is connected
681.99 at the physical level,
physiological level.
685.02 Could you just share for a moment
686.82 how you think about this
body-brain relationship
689.46 in terms of you mentioned
movement of emotions,
694.35 movement of the body,
695.58 that you can't really separate the two.
697.92 And for the typical person
who's listening to this,
700.98 they might not immediately
understand what that means.
704.07 Maybe it's something that
has to be experienced,
706.02 but when we think about
the body and the brain
709.62 and the whole thing working
as one cohesive whole,
712.44 what does that mean to you?
714.059 Or put simply,
715.86 when you do a movement practice
what are you focusing on?
719.82 Are you focusing on the
movement of your limbs?
722.04 I have to imagine that's true,
723.18 but are you also focusing
on how that makes you feel
725.58 or how your feelings make you move?
729.0 - Okay, okay, so some thoughts,
734.01 I will try not to answer
any of your questions
736.92 during this interview,
738.0 but I will definitely give some thoughts
740.43 and then we can play with it.
745.71 I think these definitions
747.84 and, in general, the limitation of words
750.87 ends up creating
753.9 some kind of a corruptive process.
756.987 You know, words corrupt us
and corrupt our understanding.
761.91 So, I think the brain-body,
763.44 this Cartesian state of mind and thinking
767.82 brought a lot of good, but
also brought a lot of problems.
772.11 And movement, for me,
773.49 is the entity that ties
everything together.
776.52 It's the magic, it's the thoughts anima,
780.231 it's when the coin spins
783.0 and you see both sides
appear at the same time.
786.27 It's a beautiful analogy
787.65 from a friend of mine, Dr. Rasmus Olme.
792.33 So, the mind and body
are one of those pairs,
796.53 and I call it the
movement/body/mind system,
799.5 so it's when it's
integrated, it's in motion.
803.7 There is also a stillness
that appears there, of course,
806.34 and without it there can be no motion,
808.86 but maybe that is a very good way
813.87 to start to think of things.
815.34 There is no really pure mental processes,
818.25 cognitive processes.
819.36 There is no pure physical processes,
822.3 everything touches everything,
824.31 there is a wholeness, and
that wholeness is in motion.
830.43 Yeah, the movement
practice takes these beats
833.91 and examined them.
834.9 And here is a pragmatic thing,
838.23 the scientist, the cerebral
thinking about movement,
843.27 this is important.
845.76 The emotional side coloring,
849.93 feeling the colors and
the textures of motion.
852.51 A lot of people who are involved
with a movement practice
855.03 never end up feeling motions,
857.43 really focusing on how it makes you feel
859.89 or how it feels itself.
861.99 And then the actual movement, the action,
864.54 so, it's action, emotion, and thought.
867.51 And those are three streams of movement
869.73 and they interlay together
871.08 into this kind of a braided experience
875.91 and whole experience.
877.017 And I try to bring all these
aspects into my practice
880.322 and the way that I live my life.
883.23 - I think most people who
embark on a movement practice
888.45 will first want to know
which movements to do, right?
892.56 Squats, planks, push-ups,
896.91 pirouettes, right?
898.56 Pick your movement, it
could be any movement.
901.32 Are there any sort of
just basic entry points
905.88 that you believe everybody
should walk through
909.21 as they embrace a movement
practice the first time
911.64 and maybe even every time
they do a movement practice?
914.4 I mean, earlier today I
had the great privilege
917.67 of being guided through a long
series of movement practices,
921.54 and yet, the first
practice we did involve,
923.91 at first anyway, stillness not movement.
927.33 So, if you would, could
you inform us how people
931.65 should think about approaching
a movement practice?
934.98 What is the first layer of
any good movement practice?
940.11 - So, you touched the word movement,
942.06 and it's important for me to separate it
944.46 from the word Movement with a capital M.
948.75 Movements are the containers
950.88 and movement is the content,
953.49 and the content cannot be carried
956.04 in any way without containers.
958.53 So, the first entry point
is to choose containers,
961.8 and then the second thing to make sure
963.87 is to put specific content
into those containers
968.49 and then enjoy them.
970.53 I tell people that it's
like a cup of water
972.99 and you're being handed that cup of water.
974.67 And nowadays very often people
will start to chew on the cup
979.5 instead of drinking the water,
980.94 making it yours and discard the cup.
983.46 And then, maybe later you want
to have bone broth or soup
986.58 so you use a different container, a bowl.
989.43 So, a movement practice to
start can start from anywhere,
992.52 it's a rhizome, it's an open system,
996.36 it has no center, it's decentralized,
998.73 and it can be approached from anywhere,
1000.8 and that's its magic and
that's the benefit of it.
1005.39 Some people find the
body a good entry point,
1009.53 some people don't even
enter from the body.
1013.52 Sometimes you can enter
from other perspectives
1015.8 and then inside the body,
1017.06 for example, where should we enter?
1019.34 If we decided to take the body approach,
1021.8 the spine can be a nice decision,
1023.6 but some will choose just the pelvis.
1026.72 Any one of those points are valid.
1029.51 And then, playfulness
can be an entry point,
1031.97 an attribute, and this is so open.
1035.06 So, I don't want to limit
people and limit their minds
1039.65 in the way that they
engage with the practice,
1041.57 but I also want to
encourage the self-inquiry.
1047.03 Am I doing movements practice,
1049.37 or am I doing a movement practice?
1052.22 - So, could you help
me distinguish the two
1054.05 a little bit further?
1054.92 I think I understand the difference
1056.12 between a sort of the
noun versus the verbs.
1059.06 And in some ways here we are
dealing with the challenge
1062.72 of the barriers that language present
1065.78 to something that's physical, right?
1067.04 I mean, indeed, there may not be a...
1071.51 I have to assume
1072.343 there is no perfect verbal
language for movement.
1075.56 There are certain movements
that defy language.
1077.63 I could say somebody jumped
at a particular trajectory
1081.14 at a particular speed and
moved this limb and that limb,
1083.48 but by fractionating it something
is most definitely lost.
1088.79 So, if someone wanted to,
let's say, get in better touch
1092.48 with their body, in quotes,
1094.1 in order to explore the
infinite space that is movement,
1099.59 how might they begin to approach that?
1101.6 Is it does it begin with an awareness,
1103.85 with practice, or both?
1105.92 - It begins with education.
1107.067 You know, that's probably the
most stable point of entry,
1111.59 awareness to some something as a concept
1114.548 that it is a concept,
that there is validity,
1118.52 or because sometimes people look for that
1121.46 to looking at this
entity, this open entity.
1125.66 And that's part of the reason
why answering questions
1129.38 is not something I can do
1133.61 or even attempt to do.
1135.56 I believe in the power of
the non-complete process,
1139.88 like making this table,
1143.0 but living something undone,
1145.85 not perfecting the product, why?
1148.34 Because it offers some kind of
a dynamic nature of evolution
1151.76 that naturally unravels from it.
1156.74 Almost like sometimes I do it,
1159.74 I count reps and I'll only count to nine
1163.91 'cause it tends to leave
people in the count
1166.88 and it keeps going instead
of giving them the 10.
1169.79 - Everyone wants to end on 10. [laughs]
1171.44 - Yeah, which is because of
the decimal system, et cetera.
1176.0 So, all kinds of things
like that is also important
1180.14 with the movement idea is to discuss,
1182.78 to examine, to look, to taste, to try,
1186.05 but then also not to try to capture
1187.85 because if you like the
invisible loop of Hoffstadt.
1191.6 If you look at it too closely, it's gone,
1194.51 but if you look away,
1196.19 it functions and exists
just like us very powerfully
1199.67 and obviously gives us the
experiences that we have.
1204.77 So, when people enter movement practice,
1207.83 it is about education,
1209.75 bringing some awareness to
the fact that they are living
1213.62 in a body, that they are living in motion,
1216.59 that their mind is a type of movement,
1219.47 that their life is a type of movement.
1222.26 Bringing attention to the
movement of the emotions as well.
1226.37 Bringing just attention to the fact
1228.32 that things are in motion.
1230.81 The Heraclitus panta rhei, all in flux,
1237.38 nothing stops besides something
that is the background of it
1242.66 and allows it to express,
1244.16 and this is the beauty of things.
1246.23 And this for me is the movement practice
1248.953 is this examination and bringing
this awareness into things.
1252.68 As we sit now here, I'm
also aware of my body,
1258.53 I'm also aware of the way
that things make me feel,
1261.14 the way that your face
is communicating to me.
1263.48 And I'm not just in some limited
1268.7 and very verbal, overly verbal state
1271.37 because it misses a lot
of the beautiful flux.
1275.39 - I'm going to inject some
or project some ideas,
1278.96 and perhaps you would tell
me if they're ridiculous,
1283.67 potentially useful, or useful.
1286.4 As I understand what
we're talking about now
1289.13 and what we've discussed
earlier is that movement
1292.1 can and should be incorporated
into one's entire life.
1296.03 I've even heard you say
1296.863 that even before getting
out of bed in the morning,
1298.73 one can experience movement,
1300.86 and it doesn't necessarily
have to be of the intimate kind
1303.17 with somebody else, it's
it can be paying attention
1306.53 to the rhythm of one's breath,
1307.91 or how you get out of the bed.
1309.29 Or actually, in anticipation
of you arriving here today,
1312.41 I noticed that as I was
going up and down the stairs
1314.454 in this house, that I was injecting
1318.92 a little bit of playfulness
1320.03 in the way that I might
have many, many decades ago,
1322.46 but haven't for a very long time.
1324.83 And I asked myself whether or not
1327.5 that's what Ido is referring to
1329.72 when he talks about
threading this body awareness
1332.75 throughout the day.
1333.98 As opposed to, but of course not exclusive
1336.68 from just saying I have 45 minutes,
1339.14 I'm going to do movement practice
1341.09 before I shower and have some dinner.
1342.92 Right, I have to imagine both are helpful,
1344.45 but in terms of moving through the day
1345.92 and having bodily awareness,
1348.86 clearly there are an
infinite number of ways
1350.45 one could do that,
1351.283 maybe you could just share a few.
1352.58 You mentioned, I mean,
one could pay attention
1355.07 to their breath, could
pay attention to posture.
1357.92 And this notion of play
is a very attractive
1360.62 or as we say in science,
it's a sticky concept,
1363.11 a concept that kind of draws one in.
1365.54 Maybe if you would, could you
share with us just some ideas
1368.36 to get people thinking about
1369.5 or maybe even incorporating
1371.15 movement practice into their day,
1373.43 and maybe even touch on the potential role
1376.64 of play or playfulness?
1378.32 - Okay.
1381.53 Yeah, those are some good directions.
1384.98 I think one thing is this
what you call wordlessness.
1389.141 I have been recommending to
people non-verbal experiences
1394.25 and the awareness of the body,
1396.89 which is not really the awareness
of the body, as you know,
1400.73 not purely or not fully.
1403.37 The awareness of motion is
a very good way to start
1408.45 to bring awareness to that layer.
1411.23 And that layer will start to get clarified
1413.36 more and more and more,
the more you practice.
1415.157 And then, it will enable for most people,
1417.83 a safe haven away from many
states and difficulties,
1422.0 and will unlock a lot
of potential attributes,
1427.34 and strength, and freshness,
and a lot of beautiful things.
1432.53 Really one of the really perspectives
1435.65 about who we are comes from a person
1438.98 who influenced my thinking a lot,
1440.33 Moshe Feldenkrais, the
late Moshe Feldenkrais.
1443.03 And he talks about the body
as the core three elements,
1447.08 the core nervous system,
1449.81 two is the mechanical system
of muscle, skeleton, et cetera,
1455.12 and the third is the environment,
1457.28 which is a unique way to look at it.
1460.22 And he talks about how the nervous system
1462.11 is both receiving
information from the outside
1466.31 and from the inside.
1467.27 And in the first years of life,
1469.13 you work a lot on differentiating those,
1473.42 what is me and what is not me?
1476.39 And I think movement,
when you feel movement,
1479.48 you feel the movement of the outside
1482.24 that is, of course, arriving
to you and receiving this,
1485.45 and also your own internal movement.
1487.337 And the same can be said for stillness.
1490.94 So, bringing the attention
into those layers,
1494.39 it's a tricky thing.
1495.56 It's one of those elusive
things to look at,
1498.83 but it's definitely of huge
benefit to start to train it,
1502.76 start to practice it, to
feel not our thoughts,
1507.59 not necessarily our body,
1510.47 but to start to recognize
1512.72 the dynamic nature, the flux, the motion,
1515.9 and it occurs in all these layers.
1518.57 So, you will need to find
it in multiple locations
1522.86 before you start to more
and more make it your own,
1527.24 make it really yours.
1529.64 How, for example,
1532.01 simple, pragmatic things
I used to do this,
1534.266 I spent some time in Hong Kong,
1537.169 I would need to get my practice in,
1539.48 but I'm really turned
off from commercial gyms
1543.68 and there is not a lot of
nature accessible there
1546.74 so I would just strap on my bag
1548.9 and I would walk the streets of Hong Kong,
1550.91 which are very crowded
1552.29 and then I would try to
avoid touching anyone.
1555.74 And it would be like two hours
1557.75 of just like moving, involved,
1559.85 fully involved, fully in my body,
1561.47 and experiencing beautiful things,
1564.38 and enjoying and developing myself as well
1566.99 in all kinds of scenarios,
1568.25 up and down in the escalators and off.
1571.55 So, this is an example
of a way to practice.
1576.59 And then, the way that we are sitting
1579.35 like these chairs, for example,
1581.39 our chairs are not very dynamic,
1582.95 but there is rocking chairs, right?
1584.48 And this is something I
recommend for a lot of kids
1587.81 like in schools, I used
to rock on the chair,
1590.93 which is very common.
1592.294 I'm sure-
- I used to put my skateboard
1593.36 underneath my chair and
roll it back and forth,
1595.19 and the teacher would tell me to stop.
1597.59 And I would just slowly little by little
1599.09 trying to get the most
subtle movement I could
1600.71 without them telling me
1602.36 they were going to take it away, or try.
1604.43 - Which is probably
horrible, horrible advice
1607.25 and instruction just like sit up straight
1610.04 and chew with your mouth closed
1611.81 because they remove a
lot of the self-education
1616.22 and a lot of the self-development
1617.78 and the practical discoveries
that are necessary
1620.45 and even will damage focus
1623.42 and thinking processes in some ways.
1628.88 So, for example, I would make
the chairs even more mobile
1634.187 and I would support more motion,
1636.74 and then I would be able
to bring attention there,
1639.2 but I would also be able to
bring attention away from it
1642.26 into other things.
1643.7 And it keeps refreshing me
so I don't become stale,
1647.78 the water doesn't stand,
1649.22 this is the beauty of movement.
1650.957 So, you can focus for long periods of time
1653.36 and do incredible things with the mind,
1655.1 with focus, with awareness, attention.
1657.68 And it's like we're skin in the game,
1660.26 so I'm not talking as some meditator
1663.02 and he's describing the
act of being very focused,
1666.65 but then I put a stick on
the edge of his fingers
1669.32 and I tell him, "Balance it."
1670.52 And everyone can do it for 10 seconds
1672.86 and I tell him, "Okay,
now hold it 10 minutes."
1675.53 And you see that the skill has,
he has no skin in the game.
1679.85 It wasn't developed in various scenarios,
1682.88 but so there is a delusion
that start to develop
1686.397 and that's how movement
keeps me very honest
1691.19 and humble in the way that I view humility
1694.67 and in a way that protects me
1697.76 and keeps me, yeah, it keeps me fresh.
1704.51 - I loved the example of moving
through the crowded street
1707.84 with a backpack because of the way
1709.13 in which it's completely adaptive
1710.78 to the situation you happened to be in
1712.91 and highlights the fact
that one doesn't need a gym
1716.48 or any specific scenario,
1719.72 although we will certainly touch
1721.28 on ideal learning
circumstances for movement
1723.83 and some of the work that
you're doing, of course.
1727.64 - The less of your own personal practice,
1730.55 and understanding, and
knowledge you've done,
1733.61 the more toys you need.
1736.13 The more you've really worked on yourself,
1740.06 the more high-tech you are.
1741.8 The more low-tech are your tools,
1743.81 the more high-tech you are.
1745.28 And this is the most advanced technology
1748.76 by far on this planet.
1750.68 With all the advancement, it
doesn't even start to scratch,
1753.969 and you know it,
1754.82 from the way that we understand the eyes
1757.58 all the way to with all the
respect to the Boston Robotics,
1763.1 a 5-year-old motion-
1764.78 - Yeah, yeah.
- Movements.
1766.94 Or animal motion with very underdeveloped,
1770.21 still relatively to us as systems.
1773.09 So, important to remind ourselves.
1777.05 - A lot can be done with
the body and gravity
1780.2 as I-
- Floor, a piece of floor,
1781.46 a piece of wall, a corner of a
room is a beautiful scenario,
1785.63 which you can become
discover in and play in.
1790.34 And, but we are not so developed
1793.19 so we don't see those options.
1795.05 And this is something
that I try to stimulate,
1796.97 and that's why I made it a point to avoid
1799.79 any of the big sponsorship
1802.73 and high-tech tools.
1805.04 And I on point brought a stick
1808.1 into big conventions
1810.62 and/or sometimes I use
a shirt with holes in it
1815.633 that just like a used
shirt as a point to make
1818.3 when I'm addressing a crowd to keep things
1822.535 where it's important and it's important,
1826.37 we are important, and our
experience is important.
1830.12 And we have to be very careful,
1832.58 these habits and these directions,
1836.42 they come from many times good intention,
1838.76 but they are the devil many times,
1842.15 they turn into the devil,
1843.65 just like our technology nowadays
1846.2 and what is happening with
people and with depression,
1848.99 with meaning, meaninglessness,
1853.16 also with the body in
various perspectives,
1855.47 or even I will also flip it
into high performance sports
1860.18 and their price.
1862.52 Because for me, this is
not a movement practice,
1864.71 it erases the person in the center of it.
1867.83 And then came places like
skateboarding or break dancing
1872.9 where somebody with a disability
1875.27 becomes the best in the world,
1877.01 turns it into the biggest advantage,
1879.2 but you would never be
accepted into gymnastics class,
1882.38 and I love that.
1884.15 And that change
1885.83 to place change in the
center, it's important.
1891.2 - You touched on mention of a few sports,
1894.95 maybe it was Charles Poliquin,
1896.18 or maybe it was another
trainer that I heard once say
1900.23 that, "For kids, one of the
worst things they can do
1904.34 is overspecialize in a particular sport."
1907.073 The idea being that it leads
to improvements in performance
1911.57 in a very narrow domain,
1912.95 but they raised the idea
1916.34 that it could perhaps also constrains
1918.92 the development of the nervous system,
1920.21 such that certain emotional states,
1922.686 certain intellectual abilities
will forever be shut off
1926.3 because of the intense plasticity
that occurs early in life.
1930.14 The more I learn from you,
1931.7 the more I'm thinking that that statement
1933.29 really should be extended to all of life.
1935.39 And I love to remind people
1938.15 because I started off as a
developmental neurobiologist,
1940.4 that development doesn't start and end,
1942.29 you don't have childhood and adulthood.
1944.18 Our life is one long developmental arc
1945.95 from birth until death,
however long that might be.
1948.71 So, if one is going to be anti-specialist,
1952.82 maybe even we call that a generalist,
1955.7 what does that look like?
1956.69 What are the different
domains of movement practice?
1959.63 And as I asked this, I
realized I am in serious danger
1964.76 of fractionating movement
into a list of words
1968.3 like strength, and speed, and
explosiveness, and suppleness,
1972.083 a word that I've heard you use before.
1974.48 And yet, I think for most people
1975.53 because we think in words, often,
1979.85 some of those categories can be useful.
1981.56 So, let's say I was going to
embark on a movement practice
1983.63 or a child was going to
embark on a movement practice
1986.51 and either throughout the day
1988.4 or for a dedicated period of time,
1990.92 what are the sorts of
categories of movement
1992.78 that I might want to think about,
1994.79 ballistic movement, smooth movement?
1997.1 Maybe you could just enrich us
1999.08 with some of the landscape around that.
2001.93 - Okay, first I'll address the first part
2004.96 that you mentioned.
2006.67 And I've learned from
you about certain changes
2011.35 in the way that things
develop later in life
2015.31 versus earlier in life.
2016.99 And you're right, it is something
2018.55 that Charles Poliquin also mentioned
2020.137 and I learned from back in
the day as well from him,
2024.1 which can seem dark a
bit and kind of hopeless,
2027.85 but then you should go beyond that.
2033.82 One thing that does seem to appear
2039.22 for me when I look around
2041.71 is these the concepts of unique postures.
2048.16 And I think this is true
for postures of thought,
2052.27 emotional postures, and movement postures.
2056.14 Truly, earlier in life,
2058.78 we are creating these unique postures
2062.77 and they get into these drawers
2066.25 or like language letters.
2069.91 Later in life, the process moves more
2073.66 towards integration of
these unique postures
2076.39 into all different organizations.
2079.18 The beauty of it is that you
can use very few postures
2081.88 to create many possibilities,
2084.28 just like a lib needs
a search for a language
2087.294 that contain one symbol only versus two,
2092.14 which he discovered.
2096.186 And this is something that is often seen,
2101.23 like you take someone who
moves in a certain way
2104.95 and you teach them all these
new sports or techniques,
2108.25 but essentially if you look
deeply and you're sensitive,
2111.52 you see it's the same postures
2114.07 that he will have to work
with till the end of his life,
2118.06 the same thinking postures.
2120.61 And this is really problematic,
2124.3 where we are not freeing
2128.05 the mind beyond this,
2133.99 how would I say, a scaffolding of thinking
2137.86 and we are actually
letting go of the content.
2140.35 We get more and more focused
2143.26 on the way of thinking
2148.45 versus the thinking itself,
2150.34 or habitual ways and forms of thinking,
2154.63 associated thinking, et cetera.
2157.27 And emotionally the same,
2158.65 we are constructing
these emotional postures
2161.14 and then we have to go
through the rest of our lives
2163.36 working with that.
2165.04 So, this is the dark side, right?
2167.62 But of course, there are
always possibilities,
2171.91 both I think invading this early system,
2176.59 to some extent, even if it's
5%, or 7%, or whatever percent,
2181.99 and also on the freeing yourself
2184.93 of going beyond all postures period.
2188.95 Working with the postures you have,
2190.96 but towards a postureless
way of doing things.
2195.34 So, this is something interesting to work
2198.4 when people work with movements,
2200.47 but finally are able to go into movement
2204.52 and this magic starts to happen,
2206.26 and then the techniques fall
apart and something appears,
2211.63 and it's a face change,
it's a transformation,
2217.54 it's a binary moment.
2219.4 There is a jump there for sure,
2220.708 and it's very rare to see both
in thinking, and emotionally,
2225.67 and other ways, we have many names for it.
2228.337 And some talk about enlightenment
2230.65 and some talk about all kinds
of processes related to it.
2233.347 And I think most of them
2234.94 are shadows of the sun,
2238.69 but it's not the sun itself really.
2241.93 And then, talking about ways
of thinking about movement,
2245.56 this is where I use something
I called my slice and dice
2250.0 because of the problem of using words,
2252.28 and definitions, and categories,
2253.81 I try to create a lot of them
2256.69 and I write them on the paper
and then I crumble them,
2260.77 throw them into the bin, and
I keep doing it all my life.
2264.91 The writing them down
and the geeking on it
2267.94 is very important, also
very important to let it go.
2272.26 I tell people what you
forgot is not the same,
2277.09 forgetting is not the
same as never knowing it.
2279.97 The crumbling and throwing
away is a form of forgetting,
2283.45 but it leaves some kind of a homeopathic
2288.4 trace behind.
2290.05 So, let's take some slice and dice,
2292.75 and try to look at it.
2294.49 Here is a physical one,
contraction, relaxation.
2300.46 That's a spectrum,
2301.9 and pretty much everything
falls on this spectrum.
2304.87 Also, in terms of analyzing
a person or yourself,
2308.47 you can tell me if you
feel closer to this side
2311.8 or closer to that side,
2313.93 and then it allows you to
examine your practices.
2316.24 How many of the practices are
moving you towards balance
2320.98 and how many are it's your addiction
2323.05 of just doing what you're
good at versus what you need?
2327.91 Here is another example, physical culture.
2331.24 So, we have the dense realm
2333.94 working with internal concepts
2337.72 and expressing them, abstract
concepts, expression.
2343.39 Second perspective, the Marshall concept,
2346.0 but not in the sense of just fighting,
2347.83 but also partnering,
working with another person,
2351.803 a dynamic entity that is
communicating with you.
2355.42 The third one is I call the elements,
2357.46 working with the environment.
2361.51 The next one is a somatic
one, is the internal practice.
2365.86 And of course, there are all gray zones,
2367.93 and another one is object manipulatory,
2371.29 which you can think of it
also as the environment,
2373.15 but it's more small objects,
2375.43 heavy objects, many objects, few objects.
2378.04 And then you can look
at this way of thinking,
2380.71 and you can say, "Oh, I
have many of my practices
2383.74 in this direction, but not,"
2385.39 and you can draw it for yourself.
2387.79 So, that's another perspective,
2389.41 and this way I use dozens of perspectives.
2393.1 And with the years,
2395.14 it gives people a sense
of where they want to go,
2397.72 how they want to do it,
2398.95 and what they need to address
2400.48 versus what they like
to address, et cetera.
2402.91 Is it helpful?
2403.743 - Very helpful, those different
bins are very helpful.
2408.16 I really appreciate that you mentioned
2410.26 that people will often
practice what they're good at
2412.93 as opposed to what they need.
2414.7 In gym culture, we refer to this
2418.45 as the guy that always skips
leg day type of person, right?
2422.14 You know, big upper body, skinny legs,
2423.91 or you you'll see people
2425.35 that have these enormous thick torsos
2427.36 and they're bench pressing all day,
2428.65 but they clearly need to pull on an object
2431.56 every once in a while
to create some balance,
2433.42 but they don't do it because
they, for whatever reason,
2437.68 they have an obsession with moving
2439.54 greater and greater poundage
or something like that,
2442.93 which in certain sports like power lifting
2445.81 or aesthetics aren't the goal,
2447.61 and it's simply to push
more weight off one's chest
2449.86 that you could imagine
2450.693 that there's something beneficial there.
2452.26 However, I think that
it's really important
2455.92 in intellectual endeavors
and in movement endeavors,
2459.97 if I understand correctly,
2460.96 to bring oneself to a
place of real challenge
2463.9 on a regular basis.
2465.52 In fact, earlier today,
2466.78 I was in a state of constant challenge
2468.25 'cause it was all new to me.
2469.96 And as much as I told
myself, "Beginners' mind,
2472.48 beginners' mind, beginners' mind,"
2474.04 it's hard, I confess,
to not want to do well,
2477.25 to perform well, right?
2478.51 And I think that's a
natural and healthy thing.
2481.18 Yet-
- Not only natural,
2482.95 it is necessary,
2484.87 but I want you to keep it on that side
2488.23 and to bring something to balance it.
2491.35 If there is not this challenge,
the process will not work.
2495.88 It has to be this scale.
2497.47 And you're talking about
scales of pain, pleasure,
2500.26 and this is another scale.
2502.93 And this discomfort again is necessary
2506.38 and should be recognized as,
"I'm in the right place."
2509.92 When it becomes too high
and I'm unable to resolve,
2514.63 to make any progress,
2517.81 I went overboard, but
when it's not present,
2521.74 I don't do nothing here.
2523.42 Nothing that I'm truly interested in,
2525.34 I'm just gratifying myself, wankery.
2528.46 It's in essence,
2533.11 it's not about searching
for the discomfort,
2536.68 but it's a marker.
2539.2 And I think the question
2543.76 should be who am I serving?
2546.64 'Cause people do not serve
themselves, in essence,
2551.02 they serve part, parts of it,
2553.941 some kind of a fraction of themselves.
2557.83 And this separation of
oneself from oneself,
2561.61 and this is also a result of
the practice, a good practice.
2567.37 I think maybe the biggest gift I received
2570.58 from the practice is I can say
2574.21 although it will take
maybe a certain context,
2578.17 I am not my friend.
2581.53 At times I am,
2582.91 but many times I am not my friend.
2585.13 And by creating this separation,
2587.2 I can assume a certain stability
2590.56 in the face of everything
2593.02 all the way up to our
own mortality and death,
2596.35 which is, and maybe beyond, who knows?
2600.58 - Yeah, it was a striking
moment for me earlier today
2604.21 when I was really challenged
2605.8 with one of the practices we were doing,
2608.98 and you said, "This is
exactly what I experienced
2612.37 this morning, Andrew,"
that's what you said.
2615.19 And I couldn't imagine that
you were having challenges
2617.44 doing what I was attempting to do.
2618.97 And of course, you were,
2619.803 and I believe what you were referring to
2621.25 is that you had put yourself at that edge
2623.77 earlier in the day in which
you were making failures,
2626.89 you were failing to execute
2628.63 the way that you were
attempting to execute movement.
2631.93 I should just to inject some neuroscience
2634.39 and neuroplasticity there,
I can't help myself,
2636.76 it is what I do after all.
2639.07 There are beautiful data
in animals and humans
2641.86 showing that in the seconds and minutes
2645.16 after a failed attempt at a
motor execution of something,
2649.21 the forebrain is in a
heightened state of focus.
2651.73 And when you hear it,
suddenly makes perfect sense,
2654.46 of course, why would the
nervous system change
2656.71 unless it got a cue to change?
2658.9 And the cue almost always comes
in the form of frustration,
2663.31 the [imitates buzzer] or
as we said earlier, nah,
2666.73 the nah signal
[Ido laughing]
2668.35 is the one that preps you
to extract more learning
2671.92 from the subsequent trials.
2673.69 And yet, for a lot of people,
2675.52 they feel that ugh,
that failure to execute,
2678.46 or even to approximate execution
2682.12 and they feel and experience
that ah negative signal,
2686.5 and they lean out of the practice,
2689.02 they start to depart either
mentally or physically or both.
2692.59 And if there's anything I
think that perhaps we can offer
2695.92 is this understanding that that edge
2697.51 as some people call it
2698.38 or that failures aren't just necessary,
2701.23 they are part of the learning process,
2703.75 they are the entry gate
to neuroplasticity.
2707.71 - Yes, contextualizing
or recontextualizing
2712.3 that sensation is
something I work a lot with
2715.1 and I just remind people
2716.83 and I also reminded to myself,
2719.02 and if it wasn't difficult
2720.67 and we didn't need to
redo it again and again,
2723.7 we wouldn't be again
on this correct scale,
2727.27 which is dynamic and moving
just like rolling downhill.
2731.41 So, there is definitely a
necessity to succeed, to orient,
2735.7 there is certain aspects
that you want to achieve,
2739.24 but then there is also
the letting go of it
2743.68 and the deambitioning of it.
2745.94 And within that tension,
2749.32 the plus and the minus comes movement,
2751.48 and that that's how I did it.
2752.857 And again, if I stretch it too far away,
2755.14 or if I increase one of them too much,
2757.227 then I would have some issues,
2759.13 but you will with practice
2761.71 learn to recognize the
optimal point of progression.
2767.14 Of course, it takes many years
2769.547 and a lot of play and
exposure to get a sense of it,
2774.25 regardless of the layer
in which it is applied.
2778.09 So, I'm sure in your field
and in your pursuits,
2782.26 you are already aware of it
and applying it in your life,
2786.19 talking about focus, talking
about ways of thinking,
2789.13 creativity, et cetera.
2790.96 But then it's enough that I
pull into another perspective
2794.08 and you will see that
people are specialists,
2796.45 and then they don't have
really the real essence
2800.562 of the concept.
2802.15 It's not theirs, it's
applied specifically.
2805.78 The one who changes all the time
2808.15 gets the general component
2809.77 because what appears
when everything changes?
2811.923 That is that new entity.
2814.45 Everything changes, something stays.
2818.11 That's what we want to get,
2819.19 this concept and this understanding.
2822.85 - I've heard the statement before,
2824.32 we are just a meat vehicle, right?
2826.36 We're just a sack of cells
2828.46 and it's I truly despise that statement
2831.52 because, first of all,
2832.9 it deprives us of all
meaning in of our lives.
2836.68 And we can go down the route of philosophy
2840.13 as to whether or not
there's meaning or not,
2842.26 but more importantly, it
divorces us from the idea
2845.38 that the body and brain are interconnected
2847.15 and have at least equal
value at any one moment
2850.99 that they're informing each other.
2852.19 Emotions inform movement,
movement informs emotions.
2855.79 One thing that I've heard you say before,
2857.223 and I'd really love to
hear you embellish on
2860.98 is this important principle
2863.23 that human beings are truly unique
2865.48 in terms of the enormous
range of movements
2868.42 that we can perform.
2870.67 And yet, we are excellent,
2872.41 maybe superior to all other species
2874.72 at certain types of movement.
2877.39 The one that comes to mind is
walking, strides, striding.
2880.81 So, maybe we could just explore that idea
2885.52 because obviously a cheetah is very fast,
2888.82 the gibbon seems to have
a lot of proficiency
2891.01 at grabbing and swinging from branches,
2894.49 but human beings perform an enormous
2897.4 or can potentially perform an
enormous array of movements.
2899.98 Do you think all human beings
2901.36 are potentially able to explore
2904.18 all the different types of movement?
2907.21 And if so, how does one approach that?
2909.7 So, basically what I'm doing
is I'm tabling a concept,
2913.12 which is not range of motion,
2915.43 right, for the gym rats,
discard with range of motion,
2918.61 I'm talking about the
variety of movements.
2923.86 - First, it's not important what I think,
2927.37 if it's possible or not possible,
2929.53 or if it's even possible for
you or not possible for you,
2933.52 what is important is what
you truly want to do,
2938.59 what you truly are after.
2940.48 And it's important for
me because many times,
2942.67 this way of thinking about
things is already limited.
2947.89 I like to say
2950.71 a man doesn't go to the ocean
to empty it with a spoon.
2955.36 A lot of the types of dressing
up of the concepts nowadays
2960.64 is trying to fit an elephant
2962.41 into the hole in the needle, yeah?
2967.0 Like for example, the concept of practice,
2971.17 and then our lives, as if we have a life.
2976.84 We have some kind of
a stream of behaviors,
2981.37 we have there is an argument
of free will, et cetera.
2985.03 There is a multiplicity,
definitely a man is a legion,
2989.44 that's the real meaning of that phrase.
2993.34 One day you wake up like this,
2995.83 I say, "Andrew, let's
meet tomorrow at 7:00 am,"
2998.32 but I don't know who's
going to wake up tomorrow.
3000.57 And then you send me a text message,
3003.307 "Oh, I'm feeling off,"
3006.36 right at 6:55 and go back to sleep.
3009.54 So, examining that and seeing that
3012.27 I think frees you up eventually
3014.19 and start to orient you
in a better direction.
3019.26 So, what do you want to do and what,
3022.35 but in the orientation of
also what you need to do,
3025.53 what you sense, and
what you are developing
3029.01 as an evolutionary direction for you,
3032.85 this is the important bit.
3035.34 Is it possible for everyone to engage
3037.38 in certain specific physical movement?
3039.39 For example, in Scandinavian countries,
3041.88 the squat is not very approachable,
3047.25 it's very difficult.
3048.78 They're more built for
dragging heavy things
3051.69 and also in this climate, I guess it,
3055.41 it makes less sense to squat
3057.33 and 'cause you're going to freeze there.
3059.43 So, this is and then you see
the squat in warm climates
3063.87 and it's like so open and accessible.
3067.05 They're very good deadlifters usually,
3070.83 not good squatters and the-
3073.082 - They want to get away from the ground.
3074.65 - Yeah, the shallow hip socket,
which allows one activity,
3078.81 but then the stability
of the deep hip socket
3081.21 architecture of the hip,
3084.6 the femur heads, the Q
angles, the shapes, et cetera.
3088.38 So, we are all unique and
there are certain elements,
3091.29 which like, for example,
my squat challenge
3093.45 is like for most people
3096.3 there is something there, but-
3097.15 - Could you remind people
what the squat challenge is?
3099.72 - The squat was my attempt to bring
3103.59 a new, fresh state of
mind into the word squat,
3109.08 not as a strength element,
3111.27 but it's a fundamental
resting position really.
3115.59 Actually, should be one
of the most abundant ones,
3118.05 we replaced it with sitting,
3120.93 which is not really doesn't work well
3122.58 if you're in a natural environment,
3124.53 it's not very comfortable
3125.7 actually to sit for long periods of time,
3127.5 rocks and different terrains
3129.12 so you end up lying down,
standing, and squatting a lot.
3133.35 Also, when you're moving low and dynamic,
3135.63 like even collecting berries,
3137.46 the squat is much more dynamic and open.
3140.91 And then elimination is happening there,
3142.98 so it's like it's such a fundamental thing
3144.72 and we totally eliminated it.
3146.88 We eliminated many other things,
3148.53 overhead movements, behind the back,
3152.04 all kinds of back realm
3154.08 what I call the back
realm is totally absent
3156.78 in people's awareness.
3159.21 So, that was my attempt to
bring it back into people,
3161.43 and I recommended to in order
3164.34 to really get the transformation,
3167.37 going to accumulate 30 minutes
a day in the squat position,
3172.11 unloaded, just resting down,
3173.76 not correct, not erect, many
people make this mistake,
3176.7 they didn't read through the whole thing.
3178.74 It's just resting down there.
3180.45 And of course, you have
to be mindful of dosages.
3183.27 Some people will get hurt if
they try to do it too quickly
3186.69 so they might need a
buildup process towards it.
3189.06 And also, I'm not talking
about 30 minutes straight,
3193.11 but accumulation throughout the day.
3195.39 And this does a lot of good
for digestive problems,
3198.69 for lower back pain, for
hip pains, for knees,
3202.59 and generally for aging
3204.69 because it's basically folding your body
3208.74 in the most basic way.
3210.0 Are you folding your body?
3211.05 If you're not folding your body,
3212.82 you will lose the
foldability of your body.
3215.13 And this is probably the easiest
3218.07 and the most abundant
way to fold the body.
3221.34 So, but this is an example of something
3224.7 that can be very useful
with many, many people,
3227.49 but there will always
be unique individuals
3230.64 which needs something else.
3232.62 And there are benefits
3236.85 in examining things
3238.89 and also there are
benefits in getting hurt,
3242.34 which is not often discussed,
especially not in these parts.
3245.97 So, I'm one of the only ones as a teacher
3250.53 that says, "I injured
many of my students."
3254.07 And if I did not do that,
3255.66 I would be totally
useless for them as well.
3259.98 That totally safe system
has nothing to offer,
3264.63 practically nothing is totally safe.
3266.67 And we can, of course,
we don't approach it
3268.86 with a ballsy or machoistic thing,
3271.32 but we are aware that sometimes
3273.12 we have to go beyond the boundaries
3274.74 and hopefully those would
be the small injuries
3277.44 that will help us avoid the big injuries.
3280.05 But if you try to avoid
the small injuries,
3281.85 maybe you'll get those
big injuries in there.
3284.73 So, examining which types
and forms of movement,
3288.69 the location of the
body, speed of execution,
3293.19 the type of organization of the body,
3295.65 which is a whole thing
that we can discuss.
3299.55 All of this is up for the grabs
3301.65 and something that we have to create
3303.51 individual relationship with,
3306.42 hopefully with good guidance,
3308.25 where we can get the right scenarios,
3312.27 a facilitator of good
scenarios for our learning,
3315.12 which is what I try to do.
3316.83 And less of a technical state of mind,
3318.69 do this ABC or, yeah, like chunking
3322.74 what I really dislike from a long time
3325.885 is like many people they tell me,
3328.747 "Have you met this guy?
3330.27 He's an amazing teacher
3331.53 because he chunked the
process into these bits
3334.14 and not even in the
correct places to chunk,"
3336.099 it was like and it doesn't offer,
3338.64 it locks us, this state of mind.
3340.95 I talk about the chemistry model,
3343.05 I call it my chemistry
model where an atom,
3346.47 a molecule, and then a
compound is conceptualized
3349.38 versus just chunking.
3350.97 So, there is an actual evolution
3353.13 like I call it also sketch learning.
3356.58 I'm not going to try to draw you,
3358.74 if I know anything about art and drawing,
3361.32 I'm going to start by
capturing something very rough.
3364.32 And I need to practice that
first, that dynamic entity,
3368.01 before I go into the rendering
and the shading, et cetera.
3373.08 So, the same way to learn things,
3375.33 so big picture, the small details.
3378.63 And unlike many of my
teachers in that I ran into,
3382.32 and I say, with the greatest respect
3385.14 because I don't know who taught me more,
3386.76 my good teachers or my worst teachers,
3390.15 but some of them just teach
from the small details
3392.91 into a big picture that never arrives.
3395.67 - Given that humans can
generate such a broad array
3399.45 of types of movement,
3400.47 run, jump, duck, squat, leap,
3403.05 and all these types of movements.
3405.75 Do you think there's value
in observing the movements
3408.06 of other animal species?
3409.32 I know I certainly enjoy
watching other animals move.
3414.87 I think the most,
3415.74 one of the more spectacular animal facts
3419.19 that was shared with me is
when I was a graduate student,
3422.1 someone down the hall was
working on the little pedals
3425.28 of the chameleon, which can walk up walls.
3429.36 And it was a great mystery
3430.77 as to whether or not they were suction,
3432.45 but turns out they can do it in a vacuum,
3433.89 so it's not suction.
3435.06 Whether or not there was
some sticky substance
3436.65 and it turned out, I don't know,
3438.69 I feel compelled to share this with you
3440.04 so I'm going to do it
because I have a feeling
3441.87 it will lead us to an
insight of some sort,
3444.48 that those little tiny pedals are so thin
3447.33 and so close together that the chameleon
3450.81 actually sticks to the wall
3452.07 by what are called van der Waals forces,
3454.47 meaning it's a very weak molecular force,
3456.57 but strong enough to stick to the wall
3458.61 because they are actually
exchanging molecules
3460.89 with the surface they're on.
3462.42 - Wow.
- So, obviously
3464.31 we can't do that, and yet I spent hours,
3468.78 because they were in the lab next door,
3470.28 watching videos of these
little chameleon walk
3473.13 and the articulation of
these feet is incredible
3476.73 because they're literally
rolling those little pedals along
3479.7 in a way that it kind of defies
3482.07 anything else I've ever seen.
3484.38 I told myself this was useful,
3486.63 A, because I thought it was interesting,
3487.95 but, B, because I never
really thought about
3490.53 how I articulate my foot.
3492.09 I've thought about being a heel striker
3493.53 or a toe striker when I run
3494.91 and no one can tell me which
one I'm supposed to be.
3497.157 And maybe you can tell me,
[Ido laughing]
3498.72 but the point is, or I
suppose the question is,
3503.73 do you think there's value in observing
3505.47 the extremes of animal kingdom movement
3508.53 as a way to inform the play space
3510.63 and the exploration space
3511.92 of our own human movement practice?
3515.7 - I think so.
3516.533 I think, first, it's inspiring,
3521.58 it opens up, but I will take it away
3524.19 from the romantic point of view.
3527.37 And I would offer another way
3528.87 to examine all these movements exist in us
3534.12 in ways, in certain ways.
3536.25 Like the work of Gracovetsky on the spine,
3539.407 "The Spinal Engine",
3541.26 and to see how these old ways
3546.48 of moving even all the
way up to exoskeletons
3549.24 and like primary, very ancient
3553.68 or even single cell
things are still within us
3557.04 to a certain extent.
3557.873 And then, of course, this gets developed
3562.41 like the Darwinian state of mind
3565.62 got stuck for many years on
the survival of the fetus.
3570.36 But actually, I believe,
3572.22 I always believed and
I saw some information
3575.46 about it lately that mutation
is the heart of the model,
3579.39 not survival of the fittest.
3581.19 - Yeah, people often
hear the word mutation
3583.26 and they think, "Oh, mutations are bad."
3585.33 There are maladaptive mutations
3587.94 and then there are adaptive
mutations, for sure.
3590.67 - And then, this places the
word change in the heart of it,
3594.51 what it wants to do, change.
3598.2 So, it does not want to become better,
3602.52 there is an inherent change in it.
3607.02 And then, of course, they
become better at X, Y, Z,
3610.17 fittest is the secondary perspective
3613.77 that arrives in relation
to certain things,
3615.81 but there is still a stronger,
3617.28 more ancient driving
force into the process.
3620.85 So, for me, this is cool
to see these animals
3624.48 take it all the way to this extreme,
3626.73 but it's also still reflecting within us.
3629.67 So, I love to do, like for example,
3631.56 I introduce with people spinal waves,
3634.5 and by bringing these waves into the body,
3637.53 sometimes you get weird
experiences like emotional releases
3642.45 and sometimes, and other times
3645.3 it can become an incredible
tool to help an athlete
3648.78 which specialized and
reach the top of the top.
3651.81 And then, you defrag
his system a little bit
3654.99 and offer him some freshness
and some segmental movement.
3659.4 And first you fuck him up,
3661.71 that's usually the case.
3663.51 Technically he's off,
his coordination is off,
3665.97 but later the growth will arrive.
3668.88 It's a form of playfulness,
3670.65 it's a form of examining things
3672.96 regardless of their success or failure.
3675.39 More understanding that
change is important
3678.42 and then after that,
3679.74 we can also look at the more
competitive state of mind
3684.39 and the more success
and failure orientation,
3688.38 but there is no game without change.
3690.81 So, this is the primary one,
3693.586 and that's why I say, "Okay,
3695.16 you want to succeed in the
tasks like we did earlier,
3698.13 but you stayed within the
game, to sustain the game,
3700.68 the infinite versus
finite game perspective."
3704.97 To sustain the game means
to continue to change,
3709.2 continue to transform,
3711.78 and then to win the game
sometimes mean game over.
3717.21 So, it's like, yeah, within that tension
3719.91 I think it's beautiful to
play, and to exist, and to be.
3724.53 - You mentioned something that for me
3726.15 is an incredibly important concept
3728.76 for a couple of reasons,
3729.69 and you mentioned these spinal waves.
3731.64 Right, I have to assume that's
taking the torso for us,
3735.03 you know, movement morons
3737.22 that I'll just refer to in
coarse terms of thoracic spine.
3741.0 So, I mean, I will stay away
from the technical anatomy
3743.4 and the torso and creating movement
3745.83 either side to side undulation
3748.95 or arching and extension of the spine.
3752.22 - Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side to side,
3754.65 or rotational as well as spiraling.
3759.96 - Have you ever had the
experience that of yourself
3763.17 or other people engaging
in those types of movements
3765.33 and experiencing particular
categories of emotions?
3768.75 And I have a particular
reason for asking this,
3770.46 there's no right or
wrong answer, of course,
3771.93 but I'm just curious
whether or not movement
3774.57 of let's call it the core of the body,
3776.64 things close to the midline
3777.96 as opposed to far away from the
midline like the digits far.
3781.23 Is there any,
3782.672 do you have any evidence
that that can evoke
3784.5 a certain category of emotional states?
3787.95 - Evidence, I have none,
3789.3 but I have experience and I
have some thoughts about it.
3794.4 Ida Rolf is known to have created Rolfing
3798.99 or structural integration
3800.22 said, "The issues are in the tissues."
3803.07 And around the spine, the spine is us,
3807.18 as you know, it's like can
take an arm off, a limb,
3810.12 but there's been attempts,
3813.66 but there is no brainy alone,
3816.72 this cerebral thing alone,
3818.61 the spine and the maybe
more parts of n-systems
3822.24 inside the torso are important.
3824.01 So, that's why I like to
start from that core entity.
3826.8 And then these little
fluctuations they create,
3833.4 they unblock things, they
start to move things.
3836.82 And you can avoid, funny enough,
3839.73 mobilizing those areas by
doing big frame motions,
3844.62 and competitive motions, and
techniques all your life.
3848.49 So, even most yogis, for example,
3851.22 they look extremely mobile,
3853.56 but then when you're actually
going into the small,
3855.9 what I call the small frame,
3857.64 I borrowed this from Chinese martial arts,
3860.19 small frame, big frame.
3861.57 The big frame is this big changes
3864.63 of our total body in space posture.
3868.26 And then the small frame is barely moving,
3870.39 but mobilizing the
little bits that comprise
3873.33 the same pretty much posture.
3875.79 So, these are very beneficial
3877.23 and it has totally disappeared
from our physical culture.
3881.73 When you introduce it back,
3884.79 the small frame offers the big frame,
3887.19 but the big frame doesn't
offer the small frame
3889.41 because, of course, the
small detail come together
3892.2 into the big picture.
3893.43 So, if I want to place my
body in a specific position
3896.13 and I have all these bits moving well,
3898.17 I can construct it in whatever way I want.
3900.84 But if I just work on the big one,
3903.9 most chances are I just
mobilize certain areas
3907.44 while other areas are
totally held or blocked
3911.07 and then I'm specialized one more time.
3914.58 Take me out of this realm
and I'll have difficulties.
3917.91 What will sit there in this stagnation?
3920.34 Emotion, material, thoughts, traumas.
3925.14 That's why people get discharges.
3929.34 The body memory is not
what we think it is,
3932.58 that's how I believe,
3933.413 it is stored in a lot everywhere,
3938.34 and I've had those experiences.
3940.68 A lot of people have the opposite.
3942.69 When a certain emotion is evoked,
3945.09 they start to undulate the spine.
3948.12 So, this can be worked from this direction
3950.37 or from this direction.
3951.33 And I believe by applying such a practice,
3957.28 it is wise, you basically
turn over the lens
3961.59 and you are allowing things
3965.913 to shift, and to move, and to adapt.
3968.4 So, I highly recommend it
3969.99 and we teach it in a very
elaborate and gradual way.
3973.615 And this is needed really
3977.16 because people, when they just go
3979.02 into like some general recommendation,
3980.91 they usually just get
stuck into a new pattern,
3983.287 "Ah, that spinal wave,
3984.54 okay, that's it."
3985.89 So, I've been using,
3986.91 again, this slice and dice-like teaching
3988.95 dozens of systems of moving the torso
3991.74 until a person is freed
to really move the torso
3995.07 like the language is created,
3996.93 the small enough units are
created in your understanding
4000.77 from all these systems
4002.45 and then you improvise,
4003.65 you reach the highest
level of the practice.
4006.8 - I love the answer.
4008.48 Let me tell you a bit of why I asked.
4012.56 So, there's a principle in neuroscience,
4016.49 but especially in neuroevolution,
4018.71 they call it evo-devo sometimes,
evolution and development,
4021.59 how those link.
4022.58 If you look at, so we have motor neurons,
4024.59 as you know, but for the audience,
4026.09 that live in our spinal cord
4027.26 that cause transmission and
contraction of the muscles,
4029.72 allows us to move our limbs.
4031.46 And then, we have motor neurons up here
4033.08 called upper motor neurons
4033.98 that control the motor lower ones.
4035.75 So, once something is
reflexive or learned,
4038.39 we're not thinking about it, so to speak,
4039.74 we mainly use the lower motor neurons.
4041.42 We know this because you
can do an experiment,
4043.22 it's a rather barbaric experiment,
4044.63 but it's been done many times
4046.64 called creating a decerebrate cat.
4048.92 You actually remove the neocortex
4051.05 and these cats will walk on a treadmill,
4053.03 it's called fictive
motion, no problem at all.
4055.55 There are human beings
who don't have a neocortex
4058.43 or much of their neocortex is missing,
4060.41 they generate perfectly fine movement.
4062.357 - The pattern has been download.
4064.28 - That's right, and it's truly
downloaded into the spine
4067.88 and the connection between
the spine and muscles.
4069.98 Now, the motor neurons
4071.36 that control the spinal
waves, as you called them,
4075.65 are of a particular category.
4078.29 They have a molecular signature,
a physiological signature,
4081.23 they were identified by, he's dead now,
4083.42 but a biologist at Columbia
University named Tom Jessell,
4087.14 and many of his scientific offspring.
4089.0 Here's what's interesting,
4090.71 in fish or in animals that
really only have the opportunity
4094.97 to undulate and flap their little fins.
4100.58 Though, motor neurons
4101.78 that control undulation in those animals
4104.6 are identical molecularly to
the motor neurons that control
4108.14 the spinal undulation in humans.
4110.6 What's been added in human
evolution are extra rows,
4114.56 literally categories, of
molecularly distinct neurons
4117.35 so that as you move from the
center of the body outward,
4120.68 unlike a fish, which can move its fins,
4123.47 but can't actually, it
doesn't have digits.
4125.87 We have special motor neurons
to move these little bits,
4129.02 these bits, these bits,
4131.24 and I can't do a spinal wave,
4133.04 but I can do the mudras thing,
4135.44 like the belly thing.
4136.807 - Ah-ha.
- That comes from seeing
4138.32 the movie "E.T." when I was a kid
4139.85 and puffing out my stomach
[Ido laughing]
4141.11 and then realizing that I could wave it,
4143.18 but only in one direction and-
4144.68 Okay.
- apparently not up.
4145.82 Anyway, the yogis out there
can chuckle at that, but.
4150.56 - The yogis actually do it to the side.
4152.45 - Oh, do they?
- Yeah.
4153.56 - I don't know if I can do that.
4155.54 Anyway, my spinal wave is
weak, but I'll work on it.
4159.53 But what I find so
interesting about these layers
4162.86 of, I don't want to say sophistication,
4164.96 but these with evolution
4167.96 came the addition of more
pools of opportunity.
4170.93 These motor neuron
pools, as they're called,
4172.43 are opportunity to engage in new,
4175.16 more elaborate types of movement.
4176.99 But with each new pool
became the opportunity
4179.75 to create combinations of new movement.
4182.75 And so, the reason I
asked you why spinal waves
4185.3 create one category of movement
4186.98 is that if you touch a fish
on one side of its body,
4190.22 it moves to the opposite side,
4191.87 it never moves toward it.
4193.55 But earlier we were doing a practice,
4195.02 somewhat similar of testing
this similar reflex.
4198.2 And sometimes I or someone
will move toward a touch,
4202.91 we don't deviate to the opposite side.
4205.52 So, I have this untested,
4210.53 at least formally tested hypothesis
4212.3 that movements of small digits
4215.03 and portions of our
distal, as they're called,
4217.01 far from the midline body parts
4219.68 evoke different sensations,
4221.6 maybe even far more subtle sensations
4223.79 than movements of the core of our body
4225.644 and the stuff closer to the spine.
4229.16 Again, it's just a theory,
4230.57 but I'm grateful for your answer
4233.33 because it lands at least in
the general vector direction
4236.15 of my idea here.
4239.54 - The central orientation is
mostly gone from our culture,
4244.61 we don't even walk basically these days.
4247.94 If you look at traditional culture,
4249.8 the amount of walking you
do on a rest day, it's huge.
4254.03 And so, we started to create technologies
4257.66 to bring everything into the periphery,
4260.54 controlling it with the
fingertips, et cetera.
4262.7 So, we have incredible
neurological development
4265.91 relating to this, but
our central patterns,
4269.87 swimming, running, jumping, throwing,
4273.74 throwing is not pushing away,
4275.93 that's an example, right?
4277.01 - Like some people when you
give them a ball to throw,
4279.053 that you can tell if they've never
4280.73 thrown a ball before.
- Yeah,
4281.563 they throw like a girl.
- Yeah, they don't just-
4282.938 - That is often said
[Andrew laughing]
4284.571 here in the US.
4285.587 And it's, of course, unfair,
4286.79 but it relates to experience, right?
4289.52 That is less maybe promoted
4292.97 or offered for females,
4294.41 so you get this peripheral pattern
4297.89 instead of a central-generated pattern
4300.44 that progresses towards the extremities.
4304.58 One thing I wanted to ask you
4307.49 is I know an area that
is not often mentioned
4311.54 is that some of these
ancient patterns and systems
4315.68 are primary in many ways,
4317.81 hence those newer
developments inside of us
4321.5 are constrained by using the connections
4324.71 running through these ancient systems.
4327.05 Hence, we are much more limited
4331.91 by the gene pool.
4335.51 We are hitchhikers on a
piece of DNA, I like to say,
4339.92 and that gene pool is like is
driving something so primary
4343.97 that even when you are in
kind of the driver's seat
4348.77 in your eyes, you're actually not
4350.9 or you're being totally
constrained by that.
4355.76 And I wanted to hear about this.
4357.83 - Yeah, recently we had
a guest on the podcast
4361.52 named Erich Jarvis, he's a
professor at Rockefeller,
4364.37 who was offered a position to dance
4367.4 with the Alvin Ailey dance company.
4369.08 So, an accomplished dancer
4370.55 and comes from a musical family
4371.84 chose to become a
neuroscientist instead and study
4373.94 speech and language.
- Wow.
4375.14 But he said something incredible,
4376.61 several incredible things,
4377.957 and really looking forward to
getting your reflections on.
4381.95 First of all, he said that
when you look at the species
4385.85 in the kingdom of animals, including us,
4389.15 that have elaborate
language and true song,
4394.19 they all also have the capacity to dance.
4398.09 All the...
4398.923 It turns out hummingbirds
4399.89 actually have a dance and a song capacity.
4402.86 That perhaps, and this is the going idea
4406.31 now in neuroscience and
evolution of the brain,
4409.64 that singing actually came before
4413.72 finally articulated speech and language,
4416.36 that voice involved first
to sing, to communicate.
4419.57 I mean, to enunciate ugh, or uh, or mm.
4422.9 You know, but then song
may have come first.
4426.26 Where you have song, you have dance
4429.05 and the capacity to dance,
4430.16 which of course is movement of the body.
4432.08 And where you have song and dance,
4434.33 you always find that those species
4436.7 can generate elaborate language.
4438.95 Now, the simple version of this is okay,
4441.53 sophisticated brains
tend to create clusters
4443.84 of sophisticated capabilities,
4445.91 but the other possibility,
4447.11 and it's the one that Jarvis proposes
4448.73 and I think it's in line
4449.69 with what you're perhaps raising here
4451.58 is the idea that movement of the body
4454.46 and range and sophistication
of movement of the body
4457.79 through all these different systems
4460.1 may have actually promoted
or even driven the evolution
4464.21 of the things that we think
of as speech and language
4469.1 and the ability to have multiple
words for the same concept,
4473.24 or to have elaborate
articulation of speech.
4476.27 I find this incredibly
attractive as an idea
4479.54 because certainly from
as a hierarchy of needs,
4483.26 we needed to move first to survive,
4485.15 and to mate, and to flee, and to attack.
4488.33 It makes perfect sense
to me that the layers
4489.98 would be built up fundamentally
from the body to the mind
4492.62 and not the other way around.
4495.2 So, that's one piece,
4496.25 and then the other piece,
4497.54 which I'll just share for any
reflections you might have
4500.69 that just blew me away
4502.43 was Jarvis told me that when we read,
4508.22 if, and this has been done experimentally,
4510.53 if one records the EMG,
4512.51 the low level muscular activity
in the larynx and pharynx,
4516.14 we are actually repeating
the words that we read,
4519.59 but so subtly so that we
don't actually speak them out,
4523.7 unless there's some sort
of neurologic deficit,
4526.16 which some people have, some
people mumble while they read.
4528.56 But what that tells me is
that language is movement
4533.06 and movement is language.
4535.1 So, again, we have this convergence,
4537.23 but at a very basic level
4539.24 I'd love your reflections
on those are all his ideas,
4542.06 I want to say, I'm just
repeating what he said
4544.22 and not nearly as precisely as he did,
4547.58 but how do you think of movement
4551.18 as either the foundation of
language or as its own language
4556.85 that perhaps even defies words?
4558.83 - Mm, [gasps].
4561.74 Wow, those are beautiful perspectives,
4564.89 and I definitely feel the same.
4568.49 There's a lot to say
about singing and dancing
4570.77 as well as also as a form
4572.75 of ancient programs of transmission.
4580.52 Sometimes that there is this
4582.98 in some ancient practices, the mantras.
4587.21 And people don't realize
4590.51 that they are tantric practices,
4593.9 they contain a form of
vibrating and breathing
4601.79 all tied together into very elaborate way
4605.6 to promote a certain effect.
4608.06 And how would you do something
like this in ancient times?
4610.52 This is ingenious.
4612.17 We, even until today,
4613.55 we need a full book to describe something
4615.347 and it wouldn't work as well,
4617.48 so it's like a very ancient
form of transmission.
4621.95 The more accurate we
became with the language,
4626.45 the more dead it became,
4628.73 because it is less of a movement entity,
4632.6 it is less of a dynamic
entity from its nature.
4635.93 And that's why Yukio Mishima
says, "It's corrupting,
4639.74 it corrupts us."
4643.34 So, definitely, definitely
4644.6 the conducing force
4649.16 or the primary force for me is
movement that is experienced.
4654.92 Every time we talk about movement,
4657.2 basically, even now we are
spilling it into a container
4661.22 to call it what it is,
but it is beyond that.
4665.87 So, then it is applied into dancing,
4669.02 into singing, into language.
4672.26 There is no other language
that I see as a primary mode,
4676.49 and this is a nature of
space, time, things moving.
4683.39 So, I think everything moves
4686.48 into the direction of
understanding that more and more,
4689.45 and maybe it's not so
popular to call it movement
4693.44 or people have some connotations,
4695.18 and it's okay, you can
throw away this word
4697.04 and put another word, and
we probably need to do that
4699.65 also like regularly,
4700.88 like I start to see the
end of this word for me.
4705.5 Things get corrupted
again, overused, abused,
4709.13 and then we need a new word.
4712.85 And that's even that word is
only needed for communication
4716.75 and for specific processes
of education exchange,
4721.49 it's important to stay
within the experiences.
4724.34 It's important to continue
to promote scenarios
4727.22 in which the experience is primary,
4730.79 more open experience, let's say,
4732.8 and not try to hold down
4735.98 and define overly accurately
4739.82 or if it's done throwing
it away and starting again.
4744.38 So, there is no winning concept,
4745.91 you got to the winning
concept, you got nothing.
4749.84 You were able to grab
it, you were able to,
4752.72 this is very science, right?
4754.06 It's like, "We got it, we got it,"
4756.59 and then it turns out to be nothing.
4759.208 And like more and more time passes
4763.16 I feel science is becoming more humble
4766.76 and things are being
discussed in this way.
4772.19 And because really what does science do?
4777.56 Report the sun came up
4779.45 a certain amount of billions of times
4782.87 and then tomorrow it will come up again.
4786.23 It's statistics.
- Yeah, it's good prediction.
4788.51 - Yeah, yeah, but we can go beyond,
4791.48 there is something inside
of us that can go beyond.
4794.72 Hard to communicate, I can't
offer it right now here,
4798.02 but I have the experience and
thankfully I have a practice
4801.56 and a way to sense it, to
feel it, and to reexamine it,
4805.76 and then we can talk about it,
and have something from that.
4810.523 - Edward Wilson, the great sociobiologist,
4813.23 he actually founded the
field of sociobiology,
4815.03 E. O. Wilson, they call
him, Edward Wilson,
4817.73 had this beautiful word
and indeed named a book.
4820.34 Actually, the word was better
than the book, sorry Wilson,
4822.53 but the book was a little
bit meandering for my taste,
4825.62 but then, again, he's the
Harvard professor, not me.
4829.1 Well, Stanford's pretty darn good.
4832.28 This word is consilience,
4833.72 this idea of a leaping together
4835.34 of divergent forms of knowledge
4837.08 to create a truly valuable
concept, which I love.
4841.01 I love it because, of
course, I'm formally trained
4843.26 as a scientist, I look at things
4844.49 mainly through the lens of neuroscience,
4845.9 but experience is real
and observation is real.
4851.51 And even in the field of medicine,
4852.98 you have double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials
4856.31 and then you have case
studies, n-of-1, right?
4861.14 Not often discussed,
4862.19 right, I mean, H.M.,
4863.27 the most famous example in neuroscience
4866.33 of a patient that had no hippocampus
4868.73 informed us more about
the process of memory
4871.01 and indeed the function of the hippocampus
4873.35 than thousands of independent
experiments that followed.
4877.46 So, you can't have one,
4879.53 you need all these different
forms of exploration,
4881.57 which is I think we share the belief,
4885.29 if I may, that convergent
forms of knowledge,
4888.59 eventually this process of consilience
4890.96 can eject a new concept.
4893.36 And yet, the challenge,
4894.44 again, is that if we don't
have a language for it,
4897.35 it becomes hard to transmit.
4899.81 One of the things that I find incredibly,
4904.37 I'll use this word again, sticky
4906.05 is this notion of movement culture.
4908.63 I don't know who coined that phrase,
4910.28 or I've seen it in the circles
4912.59 and accounts around your
Instagram account and others.
4916.22 I don't know if that's a
phrase that you coined,
4918.89 but this idea of engaging in
movement practice with others,
4922.01 whether or not it's dance
or other movement practices
4925.43 because it's so dynamic, there's
the unpredictability of it.
4929.09 Even to like today,
4930.71 two practitioners at vastly
different levels of knowledge
4933.77 and experience in movement practice,
4935.57 there's information, I
like to think, to be gained
4937.91 from both sides. [laughs]
4939.71 So-
- 100%.
4941.6 So, one thing that I've
heard you say before,
4945.56 which really resonated with me
4947.33 is this idea that people have
maybe particularly in the US
4951.14 have this concept of, "Oh,
I have my yoga friends
4955.1 or the people I dance with are distinct
4957.23 from my family friends,
are distinct from."
4959.78 But as you pointed out,
gathering around movement
4963.89 is an age-old tradition.
4966.98 And that perhaps we
better off not thinking
4969.68 about people we exercise
with or train with,
4972.23 but that friendship and
connection made through movement
4976.91 is perhaps the most
valuable form of connection.
4980.75 - Yeah, I think it's a
product of those practices
4983.57 that are maybe not so aware
4987.26 or not so movement-oriented
in the open sense
4990.35 and then you get this
sensation with people,
4993.92 but alone, we do nothing,
4996.05 so much so that we're never alone
4999.26 also on the inside and we will manufacture
5002.59 and produce entities inside,
5007.99 so we're constantly
5009.1 in a dynamic exchange, cultural exchange.
5011.5 And practically, I learned
this lesson in capoeira,
5017.2 it's a cultural manifestation.
5019.66 Things happen within this context,
5024.01 we rub against reality,
5025.99 we rub against each other
5028.99 and their movement occurs
5032.02 and their insight is to be
gained and development happens
5040.21 and then comes other thoughts,
5043.06 collective knowledge
versus self-knowledge.
5046.9 We are transmitting knowledge.
5048.85 If we go on top of some mountain,
5051.79 20 people, 20 normal individuals,
5057.862 and we spent 20 years
5060.58 just fighting four hours in the morning,
5063.97 four hours in the afternoon,
5066.85 and we do it for 20 years,
5069.25 but we're isolated from any
other source of knowledge,
5072.43 we would still not reach anything
5075.01 that a very young fighter these days has.
5081.1 We will be unable to develop
5083.86 those techniques, those insights,
5086.02 that's where collective knowledge comes in
5087.73 and transmission jumps us forward,
5091.24 but what is the problem with that?
5093.11 Staying within just those
technical constraints
5096.73 and never making it yours,
5098.29 that's the part of self-knowledge.
5101.95 The digestion of this
collective information
5105.64 until it becomes digested and
becomes part of yourselves,
5109.6 and then you are it
versus you are doing it.
5114.19 And this is a clear separation
that you can see in sports
5117.46 on a very high level and
on a not so high level,
5121.12 even though I would be honest
5124.18 if I say that some people reach very far
5127.45 just with collective knowledge
5128.92 and a very technical approach,
5131.29 and others reach extremely
far with very little of it.
5136.39 And there is always outliers,
5138.43 there are always the
outliers in that case.
5141.07 Another thought I had when
you mentioned evo-devo,
5145.93 evolution development is
also the Greek concepts
5149.62 of poiesis and physis.
5155.05 The growing of the seed into the tree,
5161.05 and the other process
5162.1 of the manufacturing of
the chair from the tree.
5167.89 Two processes of development
evolution, very different.
5173.11 One from everything to something,
5175.87 the other from nothing to something.
5178.24 One is accumulation based,
one is subtraction based.
5183.19 Both of these processes relate
to collective knowledge,
5186.25 self-knowledge, but they're
not exactly just that.
5189.64 And what should we do?
5191.53 This is a question that my friend Rasmus,
5194.23 he asks in his thesis and thoughts,
5198.31 what is the ultimate for us?
5200.65 Should we manufacture our chair
5203.53 or should we grow like into the tree?
5206.95 Civilize the mind, leave savage the body.
5209.38 Is it in this way or should
the mind also be left wild?
5218.17 Wild and wise is a nice
combination of words
5221.697 that I like to place together, wild, wise.
5225.13 So, this is something that I try to bring
5228.58 into the way that I live
my life and my practice.
5230.98 And I try to bring the information,
5235.15 and the wisdom, and the
collective knowledge,
5240.55 but I also try to let go of more and more
5244.15 until an essence is gleaned,
5245.92 until something is appearing
5248.44 and because everything was already there.
5251.08 For example, if I'm sitting here,
5255.73 all the movements are already occurring,
5261.73 all the possibilities are.
5264.91 So, it's just about, I need to open,
5267.61 I open this window, the
air would come from here.
5269.89 If I open this window, the air would come.
5271.57 I don't need to drive my motion,
5273.58 I need to discover what is
stopping it from happening.
5277.63 Something is constantly holding,
5279.7 and when we remove this
immediately movement appears,
5283.18 this is real deep movement
5285.31 versus the driven movement
5288.76 that is a very wasteful
of times like walking,
5291.4 you see people pushing through the walk
5293.29 instead of the controlled
falling that it should be.
5298.36 Fighting, punching to
manufacture the strength
5304.03 and then to have someone who knows
5307.03 how to facilitate the conditions
5309.88 in which you are knocked out.
5312.49 It doesn't knock you out,
5314.117 "It hits versus I hit,"
like Bruce Lee said.
5318.25 So, this is a beautiful thing to examine
5320.797 and to work within that,
5322.36 so it's to see am I skateboarding?
5326.53 Am I using this perspective?
5329.2 Or am I trying to, to control
because of risk and danger,
5333.22 I'm trying to overly control something
5335.05 that actually can never be controlled.
5337.21 The way to control it is
to let go of the control
5340.27 and then, okay, but what
about all this collection
5343.81 of information, knowledge
that I can bring in?
5346.85 Where do I want to play?
5348.88 I can play down here
or I can play up here.
5352.0 The collective knowledge is
maybe take you further in,
5355.27 and then you're still going
need to do your individual work.
5358.09 A lot of people like
to romanticize on that
5360.1 and it's you don't need
teachers, we don't need nothing,
5364.3 we don't need information.
5365.89 It's not fully honest, you don't need,
5368.62 but depends on where you want to function
5371.14 and how you want to function.
5372.087 They shouldn't be demonized,
5373.84 but they shouldn't be
overly glorified as well.
5377.02 - You mentioned about the
opportunity for movement,
5379.57 perhaps even all forms of
movement coming from deep within,
5382.6 it raises to mind in the
neuroscience of motor systems
5386.8 we talk about motor
neurons, as I described,
5389.11 the ones that actually evoke
contraction of muscles.
5392.71 And then, there's this category of neurons
5395.02 that isn't often discussed,
but certainly exist.
5399.19 Aren't often discussed
5400.24 in kind of popular
nomenclature of neuroscience,
5402.1 which is the pre-motor system.
5404.5 Most of our movements are the reflection
5407.35 of certain patterns of transmission
5411.1 breaking through from the
pre-motor to the actual motor.
5414.88 In other words, we are always
5416.89 in a anticipatory mode of movement.
5420.94 And as and I think you,
the way you describe it,
5423.61 you clearly intuitively understand this,
5425.41 you feel it, and you recognize it.
5427.3 And think of it as it's
like a layer of neurons
5430.12 that's constantly humming
5431.701 [hums] ready to go.
5433.39 And it's the release of these gates
5435.07 that allows movement to
occur in a particular way,
5437.8 could be very smooth,
could be very ballistic.
5440.35 - Which is DNA, the same,
5443.08 turning off and on, all the
information is already there.
5446.56 - Right.
- And then the possibilities
5447.847 are just allowed.
5449.5 So, I'm allowed,
5450.91 I don't do free will already,
5455.47 but I am allowed to do, I am.
5459.61 There are possibilities
5461.65 and I am dancing within that dance,
5467.53 but I am not the only dancer.
5470.35 So, that's, that's my sensation
5472.69 at least with most
5478.18 states of being, let's say.
5480.19 Maybe there is other states
that could be reached,
5485.86 a stability that will
arrive from the waters,
5488.98 from the movement of the waters,
5491.17 this humming, these
potential possibilities
5495.67 to be in that state,
5497.44 to vibrate like this is
very powerful for our lives.
5501.4 To wake up in the morning
and feel that living thing
5505.18 is the feeling of movement,
5506.473 and, for me, it's a
result of the practice.
5508.99 And so, then it's easy not to stagnate
5513.07 and then the mind can
stay focused for hours
5515.44 like we've done today,
5516.79 and I can listen and tune
in and I won't lose you.
5521.11 Which is very difficult,
5522.01 like I haven't had a good conversation
5523.84 here in the US it's very difficult,
5526.45 and I've had your attention
and you're listening,
5529.09 but it's rare.
5530.32 It's rare that somebody can do that,
5531.85 and it's a struggle, always a struggle,
5534.61 but it's definitely my
trick, my dirty trick.
5538.48 - In that you said you're allowed
5541.03 and, again, I'm taking
some of the language
5542.98 and what you report about your experience
5545.32 and I'm trying to map it to some concepts
5547.96 that relate to neural circuits.
5549.67 In the principles of neuroscience,
5552.52 we talk about instructiveness
versus permissiveness.
5556.81 There are instructive cues,
5558.16 like for instance, the ability
to pick up this pen, right?
5561.19 There's an instruction, clearly
there's a motor command,
5565.0 but that's just one way of looking at it.
5566.83 The way it actually works
5568.0 is that there's a pre-motor system
5569.77 that's already generating that movement,
5571.81 and what we've done is
we've flung open the gate
5573.73 and allowed that movement
to occur precisely.
5576.07 - Surfing it.
5577.78 - Right.
- Surfing that current,
5578.793 or this current, or another current,
5581.14 or opening the window.
5582.58 - Exactly, and if you
look at the formal study
5587.23 of movement and improvement of movement,
5590.74 the most basic example I can
give is like a tennis serve.
5594.28 And they, if you just,
5595.117 and they've done this many times over.
5596.92 You map the trajectories,
5598.09 and in a novice the lines
are all over the place,
5601.09 it ends up looking more like a tangle
5603.91 of rubber band ball, right?
5605.92 Whereas in the Federer or the expert,
5608.92 you almost wonder if it's
just one line being drawn,
5611.62 but it's the trajectories
are incredibly stereotyped.
5615.04 That's the reflection of
one little narrow gate
5617.11 opening again, and again, and again.
5619.24 Of course-
- Let me inject
5621.1 something here from an old
neurologist, you can say,
5625.72 Bernstein, the Soviet.
5628.946 And he talked about degrees of freedom,
5631.57 and they did in order
to increase productivity
5634.63 in Soviet Union.
5637.36 I don't know if you
you've heard this story.
5639.267 - [Andrew] No.
5640.69 - He was brought in to
examine the movement habits
5643.63 of the workers and he
collected some information.
5649.39 He placed, he was one
of the first kinetic,
5652.48 I don't know how it's called in English,
5654.4 the kinetic capturing of motion
5657.61 with moving pictures in that time.
5660.37 And so, he placed these dots
and they took these photos,
5664.45 which became kind of moving.
5666.76 And what he discovered was
something very interesting,
5670.21 the accuracy of the
heat of the sledgehammer
5676.12 increased while the variants
in the various points
5681.94 became more, not less.
5683.92 So, it wasn't a fixed pattern,
5686.05 it was a meta pattern.
5688.48 And this pattern is adjusted
5691.63 in this way to achieve
the perfect execution.
5695.86 Those were very early findings,
5697.57 and I'm not sure how does
that sit with everything,
5700.75 but I'm sure there is some
truth to it from my experience.
5705.22 Basically, the self-adjusting
dynamic nature of the system
5709.36 allows you to reach a very constant
5712.93 and stable end result by being so open
5717.88 and letting go of your control.
5719.32 - Mm-hmm, the example
you give fits very well
5722.98 with the one that I described before
5724.75 because and I'm recalling the experiment.
5726.61 If people want to look
this up, it's a paper,
5728.26 we'll put it in the show note caption,
5729.88 a guy also happens to be at Harvard
5732.19 named Bence Ölveczky, a Hungarian,
5734.41 I'm clearly pronouncing his name wrong,
5735.88 but I know Bence.
5736.99 And I remember the slide in my mind's eye,
5739.9 and the trajectory that was mapped
5741.25 was the movement of the tennis racket,
5742.66 not of the limbs themselves
in the Federer case.
5745.66 So, that I think aligns well
with what you're describing.
5748.69 Yeah, that exploration
of degrees of freedom
5751.27 is where the opportunity
5752.77 for real advancement
5756.67 and expansion of skill shows up.
5758.23 As that I think the way
it's been described to me
5759.94 is that we go from unskilled to skilled
5763.33 and then there's mastery,
5764.38 and then there's this top tier,
5765.76 which is this beautiful, thin layer
5767.98 that so few people occupy,
which is virtuosity,
5770.68 in which the practitioner
invites variability
5773.89 and chance back in as an
opportunity to do truly new things.
5781.93 - It made me think many years ago,
5784.3 this kind of thinking about
so what is that entity?
5788.38 Because obviously, it's not technique,
5790.72 and it wouldn't even be honest
5792.07 to say it's a movement pattern,
5794.38 there is too much diversity there.
5797.17 I started to talk about,
5798.55 I called it movement
sleeves or meta technique,
5802.12 but the word technique
is already misleading.
5807.79 So, there is some kind of a dynamic sleeve
5811.45 in which you can move in
5813.73 as long as you are not out of this sleeve,
5816.1 you are still within the boundaries
5818.26 of achieving the result that you're after.
5821.77 And then, the result is adaptation
5824.53 of all these elements inside
to keep you in the sleeve.
5827.77 The sleeve is not constricted
as we once thought,
5831.287 "Oh, beautiful technique."
5833.38 There are many ways to skin a cat,
5837.07 and that experience, and
that variety, that diversity
5841.9 goes into virtuosity.
5843.46 It's true freedom because your
focus is on the right thing.
5847.66 You don't point at the
moon, look at your finger,
5850.51 and that's really in
essence being a virtuoso,
5854.77 for me, like mastery, let's
say if there is such a thing.
5859.09 - Oh, there's I do believe
there is such a thing
5861.13 and I'll flatter and
attempt to embarrass you
5864.13 by saying I think that I'm not alone
5865.6 in viewing you as a virtuoso of movement.
5867.67 I think that's what comes to mind
5870.28 because there's this notion
5871.66 that not everything is pre-planned,
5874.45 that even you might not know
5876.19 what you're going to do next
until the moment of execution,
5879.04 but that here I'm projecting
my own assumptions.
5885.37 I'd like to talk about mindsets
5887.95 in approaching practice a little bit more,
5890.95 but I want to wade into that territory
5893.74 by talking about vision in the eyes,
5896.8 something that we both
share a deep interest in.
5899.35 I from the background
of visual neuroscience,
5901.57 but also from the realization
5902.95 that we have this incredible ability
5905.53 to adjust the aperture
of our visual window,
5907.72 we can focus very narrowly
and we can focus very broadly.
5911.44 So, something I encountered,
I think first as a child,
5913.63 realizing that I could spend all day
5915.64 watching ants play in a very fine domain
5918.61 and then look up and go inside
5919.93 and realize there's a whole
world and realizing, "Wow,
5923.05 I'll never be able to consume
5924.94 the full range of experiences
at any one moment."
5928.63 There are ants probably
in the corner of this room
5930.79 doing their thing.
5932.83 And so too our approach to movement
5935.47 can be, as you mentioned,
very big and dynamic
5938.14 in terms of the broad movements
5939.97 of our limbs or fine articulation.
5942.28 When you begin a practice
5944.38 and as you move through a practice,
5946.63 do you apply a regimented
way of focusing your vision?
5952.84 Are you in panoramic vision?
5954.37 Are you in a very narrow field of view?
5956.68 Or does it entirely depend?
5958.51 And for the person who's a true beginner,
5960.52 a true novice, like myself,
5962.5 how should I show up to
the practice with my eyes?
5967.24 - The eyes are a good starting point
5969.88 as you help a lot of people to understand.
5973.66 And when you encounter
difficulties with other layers,
5977.32 it's very powerful to start with the eyes.
5979.99 Another thing important to understand
5983.05 and to experience, you can't believe me,
5986.26 or you've got to examine it for yourself,
5989.65 we do not move the eyes
as well as we think we do.
5994.48 'Cause as long as you can
see and move the eyes,
5997.66 people never think about
it, that it can be trained,
6001.23 that it can be improved, et cetera,
6003.36 and the effects of it are far reaching.
6007.59 The eyes lead to the inner eye,
6009.99 you can think of it in a
beautiful metaphorical way.
6015.48 And it's a representation of the way
6018.483 that we use various
cognitive and mind processes
6024.06 and also, of course, affect the body.
6026.88 The eyes lead in many ways
6030.57 and the head is also a very
because all of these inputs
6034.86 are coming in here.
6036.51 So, it's very easy to lead the body
6038.55 and if you look at it
centrally from the head,
6041.58 it's a very powerful and easy thing.
6043.56 For example, when you
teach boxers how to bob,
6049.17 usually it's not done
6050.25 in the way that I believe
it should be done,
6053.91 you teach it with the periphery.
6056.34 They teach it from the feet
6058.59 because they have the
idea, which is correct,
6060.57 that you need to do it
in spatial conditions,
6064.47 in movement, in space.
6067.32 But in reality, the head will
organize the feet for you.
6071.46 Instead, you are now putting
two elements together
6074.1 and then with years of practice,
6075.63 you hope of tying them together well.
6078.15 I prefer to do something else
6079.5 because if I'll pull
your head now to side,
6082.65 you will immediately start to
organize your feet under you.
6085.98 So, I give you just one element
6087.54 to manipulate the system from,
6088.89 that's how I would teach
someone something like this.
6092.16 Many animals hunt with the head,
6094.32 so you can see the body running forward
6096.45 while the head is turning to the side,
6098.22 the whole thing follows afterwards.
6100.29 So, it's a very powerful
way to address movement,
6102.48 not the only one,
6104.46 there are many modes, thankfully,
6106.02 and we're very adaptable in that,
6107.67 but definitely a primary one.
6110.28 And then, the use of
the eyes is, of course,
6112.59 maybe the most important
element with that usually.
6118.95 Yeah, what else can I say about the eyes?
6121.5 So, how do you come in?
6123.03 Well, it depends on the practice,
6124.53 you need to start to have
some kind of a checklist
6128.43 of what you're looking to do.
6131.22 And then by this,
6132.09 you can start to tailor the
way that you use your eyes.
6135.9 The same thing I do for posture,
6138.3 the same thing I do for stance,
6140.16 the same thing eventually I do for state.
6143.61 And there is different flavors,
6145.05 there is no correct way to use the eyes.
6146.85 Sometimes it's very peripheral,
6148.53 soft, open awareness orientation,
6151.86 sometimes it's very focused.
6154.62 Notice that I'm pulling
these two opposites,
6158.37 awareness and focus,
6159.84 which is often put together and fused,
6162.57 but and then the eyes
6166.02 are like the immediate
6167.88 and the easiest entry point into that.
6171.33 Another thing is the placement
of the head and the eyes,
6175.95 like for example, when we lower our chin,
6179.13 we seem to see better.
6182.52 When we raise the eyebrows,
6184.89 there is too much exposure
of top light sources
6188.31 and so people would usually
when looking into the distance
6191.16 will tilt their chin in.
6193.38 And in many scenarios, tilting
of the chin to the side,
6197.16 or placing just like
listening with the ear,
6200.85 placing a certain eye or dominant eye,
6203.73 depending on various scenarios.
6206.49 And this is all like information
6208.2 that I can come in cerebrally,
6211.2 and think about, and
jump my practice forward.
6214.71 Instead, of just letting the
experience teach me that,
6218.52 I'm using some kind of a
thinking process to improve.
6221.34 And this is not cheating, this is great.
6224.43 Will it work?
6225.45 We got to try, it's a process.
6228.69 And those are some thoughts
and to start to play with.
6231.63 - Yeah, I love that
you mentioned chin down
6236.07 because we all have a natural reflex
6237.75 when chin goes down, eyes goes up,
6239.4 and the opposite is true when
head goes up, eyes go down.
6243.3 And there are two separate
clusters of neurons
6245.58 in these cranial nerve
nuclei that, as we call them,
6250.17 when eyes are up,
6252.45 it increases our level
of alertness overall.
6254.949 This is not woo science,
6258.03 this is the function of
these cranial nerve nuclei.
6262.11 When our eyes are down,
6264.54 we go into states of
more calm and quiescence.
6267.3 And this makes perfect sense,
6268.38 you know, and then the
eyelids usually go down
6270.0 and then people fall asleep.
6271.59 Eyes up does not mean head up
6273.69 'cause, as you said, there's
a very dynamic control
6275.85 over the amount of luminance
depending on the environment.
6278.43 So, that and then, as you mentioned,
6281.34 this difference between
focus and awareness,
6283.89 I think is a really important one.
6286.17 When we are in this more
panoramic, soft gaze
6289.77 and broad awareness, big swaths
of visual field, as we say,
6293.85 the neurons that control that
6295.44 come through a pathway
called magnocellular pathway.
6297.48 In any event, those
neurons are much thicker,
6299.52 thicker cables, they transmit much faster,
6301.47 just like thick pipes can
carry more water more quickly.
6305.58 And your reaction time
is at least four times
6309.3 what it is in this awareness mode
6311.76 than it is when you're
narrowly focused on something.
6314.13 And this is counterintuitive,
I think, to a lot of people,
6316.47 but the person who is
running to catch the ball
6318.27 is not tracking the ball
in a smooth movement,
6321.232 most of their vision is
in peripheral vision.
6323.52 When we drive we're in
this peripheral vision
6325.77 and our reaction times
are much, much faster.
6328.53 So, I don't know if I'm
reluctant to encourage people
6332.73 to shift toward a
particular type of practice
6334.98 toward a particular type of vision.
6336.15 I think what you and I,
6337.539 I hope agree on, correct me if I'm wrong,
6341.16 is that exploring these different extremes
6344.61 and everything in between
is where the real value is.
6346.95 Panoramic focused,
6349.23 eyes, head up, eyes down,
6351.21 head down, eyes up,
6352.26 playing with it and exploring it
6354.6 and as opposed to for the
first 10 minutes of practice
6358.86 being panoramic vision.
6360.06 You know, the sort of-
6360.893 - Yeah.
- earlier today we were joking
6362.67 about and kind of lamenting the fact
6365.4 that this word biohacking exists
6367.47 or that the optimal performance,
6369.42 it's that they're unfortunate terms
6371.19 because they suggest that
if you just plug it in,
6373.56 it's going to be like
two plus two equals four
6375.15 and you're going to get
it right every time.
6377.61 - Another pragmatic bit
here, if I can offer,
6380.4 is since our culture
6385.74 has been more geared and
pushing us towards focus,
6389.021 the focus use of the eyes,
6390.45 and primary language,
reading, and other things,
6394.71 we have less opportunities
6396.6 to work with the more open panoramic one.
6399.63 So, it would be smart
6401.52 to start to balance things out a bit more.
6405.57 When you're in nature, you
don't look at each leaf,
6408.81 everything is moving, and you
are kind of immersed in that.
6412.32 And then, something
attracts your attention,
6413.917 "Oh, it's a bird," and you focus,
6415.8 and you go back into the general state,
6419.19 the base state, which is open awareness.
6422.79 Here, we switch things
around in our modern culture,
6425.82 we are mostly focused and
then we sometimes daydream,
6430.11 which is maybe some kind
6431.914 of a balancing act
6436.02 that comes from deep within,
6437.52 I don't know, maybe you can share
6440.1 some information about that,
6441.3 but I see that many time people need to,
6444.45 the focus is overly done
by far in our lives.
6449.49 - I couldn't agree more,
6450.84 and I think a lot of I'll
even venture so far as to say
6453.39 that a lot of the visual deficits
6456.45 that we now see in young people,
6458.34 myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
6461.4 because if we look at things
that are too close to us
6463.56 as children or as adults,
6464.82 the eyeball actually gets longer.
6466.83 The lens focuses the visual image in front
6470.82 of nearer to the lens, nearsighted,
6473.28 than in front of where it should land.
6476.76 And basically, it's a
lack of panoramic vision
6481.17 that is or open awareness
that's driving these changes.
6484.59 And nowadays, we are essentially,
6486.87 most people are 90% of the
time in this narrow focus mode.
6491.04 You know, right before recording,
6492.09 we took a break and went
up to look at a vista
6494.4 and to look off to the
distance, incredibly useful,
6498.3 easy practice at some level,
6499.74 but I think most people are
not doing this sort of thing.
6502.41 And the way that it shapes the mind
6503.97 and the perception of time,
6505.23 of course, is a whole
other kingdom of ideas.
6508.35 But one thing I'd like to relate
6511.29 this element of vision
to and open awareness
6513.69 is earlier you mentioned the
cone of auditory attention,
6516.54 the other sense that we can play with
6518.88 in as in our practice
and throughout the day.
6523.65 Do you see any value to both
paying attention to things
6527.61 in a very narrow cone
of auditory attention,
6529.62 but also just walking and listening
6531.9 to all the sounds at once?
6533.7 I could imagine that could be useful.
6535.38 And in terms of physical
movement practices,
6538.65 I was going to say where are your ears?
6540.24 Your ears are always more
or less in the same place,
6542.1 but where is your hearing when
you approach your practice?
6546.238 - Another set of
parameters to think about,
6549.66 and to play with, and to be aware of.
6553.53 Also, I have the
experience that some people
6556.95 are better at using this
system or that system.
6562.5 And you would be amazed how
differently the same results
6567.69 seemingly outside results are done
6569.58 by different practitioners
and different scenarios.
6575.1 This goes into this
mutation and change idea
6577.62 is what really jumps us forward eventually
6580.89 some kind of a mutation.
6582.75 So, it's like all of our culture,
and practices, and success
6587.34 puts us closer and closer to each other,
6590.16 so we have the same opinions
everywhere around the world
6594.42 becoming more and more the same,
6596.94 less and less different,
6598.65 but the real hope comes
from the different,
6602.49 so and we have a difficulty
in promoting that.
6609.57 And so, this is another
thing that can be promoted
6613.38 with the right practices,
6615.54 the right, for example,
I work with corporates
6619.29 or even worked with governments before
6622.11 to bring in some of that freshness
6624.09 with simple habits in the workday,
6626.61 or in the education of children,
6628.89 or in companies increasing productivity.
6634.74 I don't really give a fuck,
6636.72 but I am there to give
what I view is important
6641.34 and what is important maybe
increases productivity,
6646.02 but it's more important to me
6647.22 that it improves people's
lives who are involved
6650.43 and improves, yeah, being and becoming,
6656.1 being and becoming, these two entities.
6659.19 I'm not there, I'm on
my way, I'm a process.
6662.91 So, thinking about hearing,
6666.75 the way that people use their ears,
6669.06 the way that people use listening.
6672.21 Again, we can talk about
placement of the head and posture,
6677.01 sometimes angling as well,
sharper angle, chin down,
6680.7 some people tend to use
the shape of the ear,
6684.81 people with different ears
closer or further out.
6688.89 This is it's if you're very sensitive
6691.5 and you're looking around,
6692.37 you would see this is
affecting people's motion.
6697.26 Even the shape of our face,
6700.44 like the development of the vocal chords
6702.27 and speaking will totally
change how we are, how we look,
6706.32 but how we listen also will do the same.
6711.24 I don't have any proof of it,
6712.56 but it is something I believe in.
6716.624 - Well, people will even make
their ears bigger, right?
6719.16 We, we try and become like
little fennec foxes or something
6722.34 by, I mean, a lot of people don't realize
6724.2 that's actually why we do this
6725.18 is to capture more sound waves, right?
6727.41 And the leaning is that
the localization of sound
6729.722 is based on a simple brainstem calculation
6732.24 of interaural time differences,
6734.37 the time in which something,
6736.35 the brain intuitively, it just knows
6739.08 'cause it's a pretty hardwired circuit
6740.91 that if a sound arrives first
to this ear then that ear,
6743.46 that it's likely coming from over here.
6746.55 Whereas, if it's dead center,
6748.23 arrives at the two at the same time,
6749.85 that it's almost ridiculously
simple when one hears it,
6753.45 no pun intended,
6754.53 but it is an incredibly
valuable way of thinking
6759.69 about how the architecture of the body
6762.57 changes our experience.
6765.3 Along those lines earlier,
you mentioned something
6767.37 and it flagged an
important question for me.
6771.93 When I see people walking
6775.192 sometimes I think, "Wow, they
really move in a strange way."
6779.31 Occasionally you see somebody,
6780.33 they walk really, it's
impressive for whatever reason,
6783.93 you know, and you just think, "Wow,
6784.95 they sort of glide along."
6787.53 People come in different shapes and sizes,
6789.33 short torsos, long arms, et cetera.
6793.11 Do you think that if
people have a body type
6796.26 that facilitates certain kinds
of movement and not others
6799.35 that they should intentionally
try and move in the way
6802.86 that is right at the edge
6804.6 of the kind of friction and challenge
6807.81 in order to shape new possibilities,
6811.83 or do you think that they should lean
6813.15 into the smooth execution
6814.89 of what comes most naturally to them?
6817.71 - Yeah, I think a good
practice is to have many walks
6825.9 because they're required.
6827.04 And, of course, there is a very efficient
6829.86 and endurance, stamina-oriented thing
6832.83 that if you have the experience,
6834.96 it will naturally develops and unravel.
6837.6 And if not,
6838.433 you can get some collective
knowledge and improve.
6841.92 And then there is a lot of emotion,
6845.52 emotional things related to walk
6847.5 like how I'm walking
into a business meeting
6851.94 and/or how I'm walking
6856.29 out of a bad situation.
6859.47 And there is a lot of beautiful
things to research there
6864.27 practically with yourself,
6865.95 trying to approach someone
with the chin slightly down,
6868.98 very linear, very efficient
in the straightest line,
6872.1 or trying to approach someone
a little bit more rounded
6874.89 from the side and tilting your head,
6877.71 and you will see totally
different results,
6880.56 totally different
communication that happens
6884.01 over people's heads.
6885.09 But if you're sensitive,
you realize that, "Wow,
6887.91 this opened the door."
6889.62 Instead, many people
you start on the minus.
6892.14 My sister, my big sister, Atali,
6893.82 she always says, "I started on the minus,
6896.7 why don't I start on zero with them?"
6899.13 You know, so, but it's
part of the approach.
6902.61 You can affect that, and you
can start even on the plus
6905.43 if you are the sly man as
the practitioner needs to be.
6910.62 So, this is something to
play with and to work with
6914.31 and then you have, of
course, body proportions,
6916.56 and ways, and we have all
these like technical invasions,
6920.52 mathematics, and trigonometry,
and architecture,
6923.58 they invaded our bodies, they
invaded our nervous system.
6927.27 And now, our walk and
our physical practices,
6930.09 they look linear and efficient,
6932.7 the path between two
points is a straight line,
6934.8 it's not, this is biomechanics,
6936.6 it's not mechanics,
nothing there is a given,
6941.43 there's no gospel.
6943.26 So, the walkers is
sometimes have to go around
6947.4 or sway from side to side,
6949.05 and there is coiling and coiling
and there are moving bits.
6951.69 And what about the coordination
6953.76 of my breathing with my walk?
6955.2 Because if I walk too linearly,
6957.39 there is less pumping of
the air naturally in and out
6960.36 so now I have to forcefully
6962.1 bring it in and out, I'm wasteful.
6964.92 And that's why you see in last years,
6967.77 these incredible runners,
especially in long distance,
6972.03 doing things we never
thought were possible
6976.399 in the worst possible way
that we used to think,
6981.63 pronation and all kinds of things
6983.883 like our technical thoughts
6986.22 were totally misguided and wrong.
6990.99 And then, somebody comes
in and does it in some way
6996.15 that is totally wrong
6997.08 and he gets results we could never get.
7000.62 And that's the beauty of playfulness,
7003.35 experimentation, change, being different.
7008.18 - As you're describing this I'm smiling
7009.5 because one of my
favorite neuroscientists,
7012.32 he's out of the university of Chicago,
7014.99 was in a meeting and there was an argument
7016.79 about evolution of the nervous system
7018.26 and he said, "At the end,"
7020.87 and people were arguing about
whether or not this gene
7023.12 in one animal was homologous
7024.71 to this gene in humans, et cetera,
7026.3 it can get very dicey.
7027.95 And he said very, very appropriately that,
7031.617 "One of the major jobs of evolution
7033.53 is to take existing
cell types and circuits
7036.17 and give them new functions.
7037.76 But that can only be done
through the playful exploration
7041.48 of new possibilities,"
7043.16 which I think maps very
well to what you're saying,
7045.77 that at the extreme thresholds
of technical execution,
7049.91 you know, mastery, mastery, mastery, you,
7052.28 your obviously performance is very high,
7054.95 but the opportunity for
evolution of the sport,
7057.71 or the music, or the dance,
or the intellectual endeavor
7060.65 is limited because you're
not introducing variability.
7064.07 In the attempt to get proper execution,
7066.8 you're limiting oneself.
7069.02 - Hence, I want to offer
something that is relating to you.
7075.17 We should be wary
7076.34 of defining the mechanisms
7083.54 and putting certain meaning
with certain processes and ways
7088.97 because just history and experience shows
7091.55 it doesn't work well for us most times,
7095.167 or it becomes like this
much more elaborate thing
7098.6 even if we were somewhat
in the right direction
7102.53 because even thinking
this way can offer a lot.
7106.13 Like for example, your advice
7108.26 about heat, dopamine, light,
7110.51 offers a lot of benefit,
but also can create problems
7114.47 and it can enclose something
7118.4 which the improviser
7122.75 will find, the MacGyvers, right?
7124.7 Like take a pink, some paper clip,
7128.15 and you make it into something great.
7131.15 And this is really our,
7134.42 we are the biggest improvisers around
7136.37 like that's what made
us who we are, I think,
7138.707 and this is incredible
what we can do with it.
7142.46 You know, the Russian-American
space exploration story
7147.47 with the space pen,
7148.91 famous story about the
development of the space pen.
7152.42 - I don't know.
- It's a-
7153.32 - A space pen?
- Yeah.
7154.411 - No, I don't know about this.
7155.41 - I think it's an urban myth.
7157.78 I don't know if it's true,
but I like it so I use it.
7161.15 Well, there was this, of
course, a space competition
7165.71 and the Russians put the
first animal in space
7169.566 and the first.
- He was a macaque monkey
7171.07 or something like that, yeah.
- Yeah.
7172.936 And then Laika, and they
put the first Sputnik,
7177.68 the satellite, and men in space,
7180.23 but Americans took the man on the moon.
7183.89 And on the way a lot of
technologies got developed
7186.347 and the Americans because
of lack of gravity out there
7189.17 developed the space pen
with a huge investment,
7191.93 the Russians used a pencil.
7193.801 [Andrew laughing]
7196.55 So, I don't know if it's true,
7198.77 I don't think it is,
7199.61 but it represents something
in the state of mind.
7202.49 Like you look at, for example,
7203.63 the military equipment
in Soviet equipment,
7206.72 it all can do multiple things
7209.57 and it means that it's heavier,
7211.1 it's less efficient, it's not as light,
7214.13 but even the Navy SEALs
will still carry an AK
7219.32 with certain conditions, why?
7221.69 Because you can pour
a whole bucket of sand
7223.76 into the mechanism and
it will keep running
7226.13 while the most advanced
German Heckler & Koch
7229.13 and accurate and light weapons,
7231.74 for every grain can get
stuck and overly specialized.
7235.19 And there is something about this openness
7236.87 that we humans need to keep,
7239.42 and also maybe something for our leaders
7242.39 to be more of less specialists
and more in this openness,
7245.99 less capable in this or that way,
7248.78 but more capable of doing the whole thing.
7253.67 - I love the story, whether
or not it's a legend or not,
7257.3 it's legendary because it's fantastic.
7260.48 As you say, in the laboratory,
7261.56 whenever someone takes
on a project in my lab,
7263.42 I always say, "You know,
you have to ask yourself
7265.61 how much technical detail and
challenge you want to take on
7269.09 because with more technology,
advanced technology,
7272.18 yes, there's the opportunity
for more discovery,
7273.98 but more downtime.
7275.33 Your PhD will literally take longer
7277.58 if you're going to use a microscope
7278.87 that's out of commission 30% of the time,
7281.72 and you just have to understand that."
7283.49 So, there's a dynamic interplay there.
7286.31 - By the way, I think that
scientists get it right,
7289.01 it's where you transmit the knowledge
7290.917 out of the scientific field
7292.91 because science have
debate and everything,
7295.46 you're not so connected,
7296.99 of course this can happen as well,
7298.31 but then when it goes out
7300.74 and the simple person
without the experience
7305.51 takes it more as a
gospel, as a fixed thing,
7308.12 and then it was just a report.
7309.95 - Right.
- It was just reporting
7311.0 some functions here and play with it,
7313.25 see what it does for you.
7315.133 Because with all the greatest
information that I can give,
7319.01 the person will examine it
7320.267 and it might be not useful at all for him.
7324.02 This is the practitioner,
make it your own,
7326.75 go practice, try heat, cold, light,
7330.74 movement, awareness to
this, awareness to this.
7334.196 And this is up to you to make it yours,
7336.44 but we don't like to
have this responsibility.
7339.83 - No, people prefer to have
7341.42 that this will work the
first time every time
7344.15 and will serve you best
compared to everything else.
7347.69 And while there are more
reliable tools than others,
7351.5 in my mind, the more reliable tools
7353.6 tend to be ones that are
grounded in our innate physiology
7359.51 as opposed to some, I
don't like the word hack,
7361.82 in fact, I loathe the word biohack,
7363.71 as we were talking about again earlier,
7365.93 because a hack in my mind is something
7368.36 that is designed for one purpose
7370.01 that's used for another,
7371.587 it's not the most
efficient use of that tool,
7374.6 nor is it naturally the best solution.
7377.45 Whereas, biology has
some very good solutions,
7379.91 but they don't always
work, not every time.
7383.6 Earlier today, we did a practice
7385.04 in which involved a invasion,
7388.79 shall we say, of peripersonal space.
7391.34 We weren't standing super close
for any particular reason,
7394.19 but there was God forbid-
- God forbid.
7396.74 - But there was we were
close enough together
7400.13 we could touch one torsos
7401.78 and we were doing that
as part of this practice.
7404.15 And you encouraged me to pay attention
7406.13 to how does it feel
7407.78 to have someone in your
peripersonal space?
7410.3 And then, this notion of reactivity.
7412.07 I find this an immensely interesting
7414.17 and potentially powerful practice
7416.72 because I think a lot of people,
7418.52 I know a lot of people suffer from anxiety
7421.79 just being in a face-to-face conversation.
7424.1 Some people have a lot of anxiety
7426.02 about being physically close to people,
7427.7 whether or not they know them or not.
7429.56 And many people are reactive,
7431.33 they are in that anticipatory state
7433.16 of something that is going to happen.
7434.57 And sometimes this relates to trauma
7436.25 and negative experience, but sometimes no,
7437.96 sometimes they're just not
used to being in dynamic,
7441.23 excuse me, exchange with other beings.
7444.68 And so, one thing that I love
about the movement practice
7448.16 and how dynamic is that
one can explore that space.
7450.35 Maybe you could talk about
that a little bit more.
7453.56 - Yeah.
7456.71 Touch, proximity, all these things,
7461.27 also taking very,
7465.26 it takes a very, I think,
limited place in our lives.
7468.98 People are not touched and
they don't touch enough.
7472.13 There is certain bubbles
of peripersonal space
7475.55 according to culture,
according to environment,
7477.92 what is right, what is wrong?
7479.21 And then came all the, of
course, political correctness,
7482.54 and harassments, and all kinds.
7485.33 And this is a problem,
7486.71 it's a problem to navigate
all this scenario.
7490.19 And I think we are,
7491.69 there is definitely this
side which is suffering.
7495.41 People go to BJJ classes to touch,
7498.257 not to learn BJJ.
7500.96 Most of it, they're not even aware of it,
7503.15 before they would go
to a prostitute, maybe.
7508.43 It would not be honest to say that,
7513.41 yeah, this is not required or
necessary more in our lives.
7518.27 Children who are not touched,
7519.8 there is a lot of information
about that and the problems,
7522.68 but adults who are not touched,
7524.54 there is not a lot of information.
7525.89 And I think it's no less of a problem
7528.02 because it's something that
has to be constantly present.
7532.19 And then, proximity being
able to, as you said,
7537.32 remove certain reactivity
and to learn to control
7543.41 that volume control
over how reactive I am,
7547.82 and in other scenarios,
7549.14 how do I remove this reactivity altogether
7551.3 is very important for performance
7553.07 and also for our lives for
clear thinking, et cetera,
7556.37 because everything is moving through us
7558.59 and is being monitored by us
7561.14 so everything has the
potential to detract us
7563.9 from a certain direction of exploration
7567.2 or and if you're reactive, you're a slave,
7571.048 and it becomes worse and worse and worse.
7574.52 Or as, for example, a fighter,
7576.56 or a football player, et cetera,
7578.6 has to know what to
take, what not to take.
7581.09 The fact that you can sense more
7582.98 doesn't mean you should react to it.
7584.48 And the practice helps that
7586.88 by bringing people into these scenarios,
7589.19 but oftentimes disarming them.
7591.35 Like when we were working closely today,
7594.08 and because you have a certain background
7597.2 with boxing or fighting,
7599.33 I can tell you, you are
missing some kind of a way
7603.65 to be in that space that is not marshaled.
7607.61 So, you carry a certain tone,
7610.34 although you're a very kind person,
7612.32 but oftentimes you held me
7614.81 without realizing you're holding
me with a lot of strength,
7617.78 for example, and it just,
7622.61 it was clear to me you're not fully aware
7624.89 of what is unfolding
7625.723 and it's just, of course,
a question of experience.
7629.42 So, to be able to be in this scenario,
7631.04 but do something else,
7632.93 which is not geared towards
winning, losing competition,
7637.04 or just being able to
play with another person.
7639.89 Like for example, contact
improvisation took that
7642.95 and played with that,
7644.237 and the work of Steve Paxton
7646.04 for the ones who are not familiar.
7649.67 So, this is where I call it the hybrids
7654.05 become very useful,
7655.64 like we don't when you are
practicing in this open way,
7661.04 you are not bound by specific rule set
7663.74 or ways of doing things.
7665.0 It can be a fight, but it can be a dance
7670.1 a moment after.
7671.03 Another thing that I learned from capoeira
7674.18 the situation's very tricky there
7675.92 'cause I've seen kids
doing cartwheels in Brazil
7679.37 and scissors fall from their pocket.
7682.97 Why, why would you go to with
a scissor in your pocket?
7686.96 Obviously, there is certain intentions
7689.48 and then at other times you see back flips
7691.25 and beautiful things, but people
die in capoeira every year.
7696.95 - Neck breaks or something?
7698.69 - Kicks through the face
from various violence.
7703.1 It's I've explored other
martial arts and boxing,
7707.36 I was involved with MMA and BJJ,
7710.42 but I tell you the most violent arenas
7712.49 is that vibe 'cause it's unknown.
7714.92 One moment, it smiles,
7716.57 another moment, it's something
else and it's uncontrolled.
7718.88 There is no categories, no weights,
7720.53 and it's a street phenomenon.
7722.69 So, you have musical instruments,
7724.58 sometimes they break it on your head.
7726.35 People don't see that,
7727.34 but you can look online on YouTube
7729.47 and see some of that side of capoeira,
7731.81 which is actually the day-to-day in Brazil
7736.34 and the reality and how things unfolded.
7739.55 So, it's very important to explore
7743.21 many ways of being within
different distances and spaces
7747.23 from other people and
touched in different ways
7750.38 and not contextualizing
it always in the same way.
7754.76 I can touch your chest in one way,
7757.64 I can touch it with the exact
same pressure and speed,
7760.67 but it will feel very different.
7762.95 The parameters, I'm not
sure, certain intentions,
7766.22 certain combination of postures or ways,
7769.46 and this is beautiful exploration.
7771.191 And again, I would
encourage you and others
7776.12 to explore the discomfort.
7778.16 For example, certain
discomfort to be with a man
7782.213 in a certain scenario or with a woman
7784.31 and trying to see what is that?
7786.98 Because if we're truly strong,
7789.89 we are not afraid of anything.
7791.69 If we truly know who we are
7794.75 and we are in that exploration,
7796.97 we don't know the end result,
7798.47 but we are in a research
7800.15 and then we are not afraid
of being in debt or this,
7803.18 and we don't come out of boundaries,
7805.28 and this will improve
our culture tremendously.
7807.77 Of course, there must be agreement,
7809.87 you never force yourself,
7810.95 but you meet someone
who is also interested
7813.23 in that exploration and then you do it.
7816.031 And there are many scenarios
7818.45 to do that with traditional practices,
7820.82 like learning to grapple
7822.62 or going to contact improvisation
7826.25 and studying there, or going to dance,
7828.86 to Latin dance class
7830.707 or and there is, of course, my favorite
7833.27 is to create and to come
up with your own hybrids
7837.62 of that and scenarios.
7839.72 Communicating with your
loved one through movement,
7842.51 not sitting around food and talking,
7846.17 moving together in all kinds of ways.
7848.09 Sometimes it's walking together,
7850.04 but sometimes it's all
kinds of, it can be game,
7853.7 playful, it can be romantic.
7856.032 And there are many shades,
7858.23 sex doesn't start here
and end here, right?
7861.68 It's like a continuum,
7863.09 and we don't even need
to define it in that way.
7866.12 So, with time, I think it unlocks
7870.32 a lot of things.
7871.153 People become much
stronger in a good sense,
7873.89 in sense of becoming, being,
7876.92 and we abuse less, and we can approach,
7882.38 yeah, other aspects to us.
7885.02 - I love the idea that
through the exploration
7887.3 of a range of physical contacts
7890.84 provided one knows they can always return
7893.33 to their center, so to speak,
7895.52 then there's a lot of
opportunity that opens up.
7898.7 I wish there was more of that
encouraged in children's play,
7903.26 but also, as you mentioned,
in adult environments.
7907.07 Because yeah, nowadays
for all sorts of reasons
7911.06 that you've touched on,
7912.95 the idea of keeping at least
in arms length distance
7915.26 has become critical.
7916.34 There are a lot of environments
7917.21 actually where hugging is not allowed.
7919.91 I don't know what it's like in Israel,
7921.5 but in the states many
institutions you're not allowed
7924.41 to touch anyone else's body.
7926.93 There's actually a wonderful study
7928.04 that comes to mind from
an Israeli laboratory,
7930.02 a guy named Noam Sobel, who's over there,
7933.92 who has shown that by recording
people's first interactions
7938.51 that when people meet,
if they shake hands,
7942.5 they almost always,
7944.3 I think it's greater than 85% of the time
7946.52 they will then wipe the chemicals
7948.05 from the other person onto their own eyes,
7950.24 typically their eyes or their face.
7952.4 This changed a little bit
during the whole pandemic thing,
7955.82 but this is thought to be a carryover
7959.78 from what other animals do
7961.01 in terms of exchanging
microbiome elements,
7963.56 exchanging chemicals that
we're constantly feeding
7966.29 our subconscious with
the chemical knowledge
7970.37 of the chemical constituents
of other people, right?
7974.24 So, it goes way beyond how people smell,
7977.27 how they look, et cetera.
7978.83 More touch seems to me just, as you said,
7981.83 provided it's consensual,
7982.76 it seems like it's just a
really good thing overall.
7985.79 - And I think maybe also
important for discharging,
7989.87 discharging certain experiences,
remodeling, reframing.
7993.5 So, it's like touches,
it's very powerful in that.
7996.622 If you're touched and
you're touching a lot,
7999.59 you're unpacking and you
experience that touch
8002.56 that maybe has been traumatic
and you're reframing it,
8006.1 you have the opportunity,
which is something interesting.
8011.05 I've heard some story
8014.5 about some traditional culture
8016.66 in which when you were burned by mistake,
8019.69 they would immediately burn you again.
8023.079 And it made me think,
8024.127 and then there would not be any burn marks
8027.79 and there would not be
the same side effects,
8030.94 that's the claim.
8033.01 It made me think it's like,
"What's the source of this?"
8035.38 And I realized that maybe it allows
8038.26 a certain completion to happen
8041.05 that in the traumatic moment is not there.
8044.08 So, the re-exposure,
while you're still open,
8047.02 the pores are still open,
8048.88 allows you to reframe the experience
8051.4 and then the unfolding
of the rest of the event
8055.06 is very different.
8056.59 This is if you're touching
8058.21 in your practice in the day-to-day,
8059.8 and you're working with people,
and you're being touched,
8061.72 and people come closer, further
away, it happens naturally.
8067.39 Yeah, and if you pass a certain limit
8070.18 and it becomes too much,
8072.37 there is always, of course, communication
8074.44 that has to be present.
8076.54 Certain cultures make
this communication pre,
8080.71 certain cultures post.
8083.35 The Israeli, for example, post,
8085.75 here pre.
8086.98 - Ah, so in Israel,
8087.813 they'll say, "That
didn't feel good to me,"
8089.8 or, "That felt good," or, "That was fine."
8091.93 - Yeah, it would be more common.
8095.2 Here in the airport,
8096.73 the guys telling me, "I'm
going to slide my hands
8099.04 up towards your crotch
until I meet the hard stop,"
8103.951 and then he does this in a way
that is supposed to show me,
8108.07 I have no enjoyment in that
8110.95 and for me it just feels aggressive.
8114.07 But his intention is good, showing me.
8117.16 But if it was a loving touch,
8119.11 it would be nicer for me actually,
8121.48 personally that's it would be gentle,
8124.6 but he goes up there and he shows me,
8126.947 "I have no enjoyment in this."
8129.927 [groans] That's my testicle right there,
8133.45 so it's different choices.
[Andrew laughing]
8137.29 I don't think it's like worse,
8138.697 but this description can
be a bit dissociated.
8142.39 And what does it make me think?
8144.01 Is it truly what he feels or not?
8146.277 'Cause it feels robotic, so it's not.
8149.5 So, sometimes I'd rather not say it
8151.6 and I'm going to touch your chest
8154.36 and just place my hand on the chest.
8157.0 And, of course I, we
can't avoid a problem,
8161.02 I'm not suggesting that there is,
8162.52 but there is an examination.
8164.14 And because I moved around
and around the world,
8166.84 I've seen many things
8167.77 and I've seen benefits
here and benefits there.
8172.18 And in the practice, I think
it's important to discuss this,
8175.18 to examine this, I don't have a solution,
8176.98 but it's something to talk about.
8179.65 - It is something to talk about,
8180.97 and I'm glad you raised it
8181.93 because I think that it's so clear to me
8184.54 that much of the value
of a movement practice
8187.42 involves this dynamic
interaction with somebody else.
8189.85 As you pointed out, it can
be performed on one's own
8192.4 and practiced throughout one's day.
8194.47 But the unpredictability is
a key element to all of it,
8199.09 and in bringing out all the potential
8202.18 that you've described.
8204.52 In reference to this notion of trauma
8206.65 and burn and re-burn.
8208.54 My colleague at Stanford, David Spiegel,
8210.49 he works on trauma
8212.56 and has actually on this podcast,
8215.23 he voiced that he's against
things like trigger warnings
8218.11 because of the way that
it puts the nervous system
8219.88 into this state of
readiness and reactivity
8222.58 that can exacerbate problems.
8225.31 Whereas, it's very clear
from the literature on trauma
8229.57 and trauma relief that
the way to deal with that
8232.15 is through a controlled,
8234.07 but clearly a controlled
re-exposure to the trauma
8237.7 in order to diminish the
emotional response over time.
8240.61 I mean, it's very clear
if we avoid the thing,
8243.28 obviously we don't want
to re-injure ourselves
8245.14 or re-traumatize,
8246.16 but if one avoids the
thing that makes them upset
8248.14 over and over, all it
does is serve to create
8250.06 a heightened state of readiness,
it primes more trauma.
8253.18 - Yeah.
- So, I think
8254.05 it makes good sense.
8254.95 - I think impressions are very useful here
8257.98 also when stepping into an
area in which trauma can occur.
8262.3 And then, by going through the impression
8266.2 that it already occurred,
8267.76 you create some kind of a
thermal layer of protection,
8272.23 so I've already been hit
when I'm entering that space,
8276.64 it's so beneficial.
8278.47 Or I've already been touched
in a way that I didn't like
8281.53 if I go to a contact improvisation class,
8283.99 and just running this
scenario in your head
8287.68 protects so well, yeah.
8291.16 - I'm glad you mentioned
running scenarios in your head.
8293.14 I've been curious all
day as to whether or not
8295.81 you do visualization
8297.67 or mental rehearsal of physical movement.
8301.12 This is it seems to be a
popular idea in the states,
8304.6 people are always asking me, "You know,
8306.31 can you just imagine a movement
8308.5 and learn it better than where
you to actually perform it?"
8312.43 My hunch based on and my understanding
8314.62 of the scientific literature
is that visualization
8317.47 can be useful to some extent
8319.33 for people that are very
good at visualization,
8321.79 but for many people, it doesn't help.
8323.92 And that there's nothing
like real physical practice
8327.43 to improve physical practice.
8330.67 - Yeah, the word visualization's
not good, obviously,
8334.63 it has to be experientialization
8339.19 in a very complete way, not
just visually, of course.
8343.87 And unless you already developed
8349.09 certain experience, tangible experience
8351.513 that has benefited from
feedback, from outside feedback.
8357.16 It is not a very useful thing to do,
8360.037 and it ends up being fabrications.
8364.42 But if you are very experienced
8365.89 and you already gained the
benefit of being burnt here
8369.19 or overextended here,
8371.02 then you have a certain experience
8372.55 and then you can strengthen
certain aspects of it,
8375.43 but you got to be careful
because you do not have feedback.
8379.33 And because of the missing feedback,
8381.07 you might develop delusions.
8383.14 It might be that you
develop stronger patterning,
8386.59 but ultimately this would lead you away
8389.68 from the aliveness of the movement itself.
8394.39 Drilling, for example,
very useful to learn
8399.34 a general infrastructure
of the movement sleeve
8403.15 or the technique, but then to dress it up,
8406.12 you need feedback, you
need it to be alive,
8409.48 you need to receive something corrective.
8414.19 - I love it.
8415.81 For many people, they approach movement
8418.3 in the form of weight
training, or yoga, or running.
8422.56 Yoga's a bit more dynamic,
8424.06 but it fairly linear types
of exercise and movement,
8429.73 Peloton, rowing, those kinds of things.
8433.09 I think most people
will probably not depart
8437.05 from those practices entirely
because they like them.
8439.72 I'm speaking about myself,
8441.19 I like some of those
very much, I enjoy them.
8444.31 But in terms of thinking about
adding a movement practice
8447.73 to one's already existing exercise regime,
8452.8 I can imagine threading
it throughout the day,
8454.39 I can imagine having a
dedicated movement practice.
8456.79 One thing that I have started doing
8459.76 on the basis of some of your teachings,
8461.86 and I just sort of created this idea
8463.24 is rather than statically
8464.74 standing there and lifting weights,
8465.91 actually walking from, as
I alternate repetitions,
8468.67 it occurred to me that
I'd never done a curl,
8472.6 a bicep curl with one foot
in front of the other,
8475.96 and then I'd never
actually switched that up.
8478.84 And it's kind of an odd stance
to be standing in parallel
8481.42 and curling one's arm,
8482.29 it's kind of a ridiculous
movement when one thinks about it.
8484.84 So, I started incorporating some of that,
8486.13 you get some strange looks in the gym,
8487.57 but I just give them strange looks back.
8489.76 So, what are your thoughts
[Ido laughing]
8492.34 about these very linear forms of exercise?
8494.522 And, do you encourage people
8497.8 to expand the play space, as it were,
8501.19 for these kinds of exercise?
8503.05 Or do you think that movement
practice is just best explored
8507.13 through three dimensionality,
8510.07 gravity, and maybe a stick or a ball?
8513.085 - Hmm, it's definitely a problem,
8516.34 and it's approachable.
8518.17 People want a quick, people want a hack,
8520.93 people want the icing, there is no cake.
8524.95 There is no cake, and it's
just like industries of icing,
8528.13 icing, icing on what?
8529.81 What are you putting it on?
8531.31 So, for me that, that's why
I'm going towards this side,
8536.17 it's like I have my life,
8538.12 now tell me what movement
practices I should pursue.
8542.32 You are movement,
8544.6 in essence, you are not
thinking of yourself
8548.17 in any serious way through my eyes.
8553.0 There is a dynamic entity to you,
8556.0 the body is a huge part
of it communicating,
8559.81 you have genetic layers,
8562.57 there is a personalities
that got developed
8565.24 and built around various influences,
8567.46 but then there is also
some kind of an essence,
8569.95 something that reeks
from within the cells.
8573.7 And if you grew up in my family
8576.46 and I grew up in your family
and it would still be the same,
8579.7 and that it's something that
I always try to think about,
8582.52 what is that inside of me?
8586.48 So, I think these practices,
they're very good,
8589.36 but they're not designed for the goal
8592.03 that we think they were designed to do it,
8595.81 it orients towards something else.
8597.4 For example, yoga,
8599.38 there is a good book
called the "Yoga Body",
8602.14 which will destroy a lot
of people's yoga practice.
8606.334 And it goes into how
did we get to this yoga,
8609.61 the influence of Swedish gymnastics
8612.16 and Mongolian contortionists,
8615.94 and the Western, the West affecting it,
8620.59 and then the ancient practice,
8622.12 which was barely asana-related,
8626.23 posture, position.
8627.28 So, actually you said yoga is less linear,
8629.5 yoga is very linear, very
linear these days, these lines.
8633.55 Look at all the traditional dances,
8635.47 they look like nothing like yoga.
8638.05 Look at tai dance, look at
Chinese dances, martial arts,
8642.25 it's all rounded, it's all curved,
8643.66 it's like the like out nature,
8645.49 what you see in nature and
the movement of the animals.
8649.33 So, where does it come from?
8651.82 These are things to understand
8653.23 because it designs you now, it shapes you.
8656.05 You're placing yourself
in these forces of change
8659.62 and these streams of change,
8661.51 and you have a good intention,
8662.83 you just want this or that,
but the joke is on us.
8667.09 And this is the movement practice
for me is first education,
8672.01 let's start to think about this.
8673.6 I have nothing that I
can just sprinkle now,
8677.83 some magic powder that
will help resolve this
8681.04 because it's a start of
a deep investigation.
8685.3 And then, some of the things,
let's talk pragmatically,
8688.51 because what you described
8690.43 is not about you placing the foot in front
8692.83 when you're curling, it's
about the examination,
8696.43 this is why it is a very good direction.
8700.21 And then, you will need
another one, another one,
8702.46 don't get stuck on that
foot in front of it
8704.8 and try to do with the eyes closed
8706.93 or with a different head posture,
8708.19 and you will see things arrive,
8710.83 unrelated things because
the associative mind,
8713.98 the thinking, this relates,
8715.33 this doesn't get to
the heart of it, never.
8718.6 So, just infusing
8723.22 these elements like in a cup
8726.07 will create endless combinations,
8729.43 possibilities, and a lot of discovery.
8731.95 And this for me is humility
of the practitioner.
8734.53 I don't know, I try like today with you.,
8737.29 I tried various combinations
8739.72 and oh, I discover something,
8741.16 oh, there is, this is a playful approach,
8743.35 and this is a researcher approach.
8746.59 I don't try to fit my
truth into something,
8749.377 I'm there to examine.
8751.87 I don't have a motive yet, why?
8755.05 Because I'm fine, I don't
depend on that to define myself.
8759.37 I'm a human being,
8760.87 but if I don't have that sense of worth,
8762.602 I'm already like geared
towards I need to do this,
8766.15 I need to prove this, I have this agenda.
8768.37 And this is how we get
all the lies in the world
8770.92 and all the problems and difficulties.
8773.74 So, these practices,
they are related to it
8777.58 to prove this, that, this way,
8780.94 why we need muscles for X, Y, Z.
8783.97 And a lot of the reported outcomes
8789.49 are often from my place is like funny.
8792.43 I hear about something
like I heard you say
8794.98 about gratitude practice
8797.56 that actually experiencing from outside
8801.76 as somebody else,
8802.6 or you are receiving gratitude
is actually more powerful.
8806.53 It's true, but I see why it's true,
8808.9 I'm not sure everybody sees.
8810.64 If somebody tries to feel gratitude,
8813.34 just sit with the eyes clothes
8815.56 or watch a movie and
sense the gratitude there,
8819.16 it will be clear to you,
8820.48 one is very difficult to do
and the other is very easy.
8823.84 Hence, if gratitude is
achieved easier this way,
8826.48 that's why it works like that.
8828.43 Although all the traditional
practices are about you
8832.36 and by challenging yourself
8833.92 to sense that gratitude yourself,
8836.44 they achieve much more powerful thing,
8837.85 but this is not the research people
8839.763 and the people in the research,
8841.54 we don't have a lot of those people.
8843.49 So, a lot of the things
that can arrive to us,
8847.33 weight training, the benefits,
8849.55 or the way that the hormonal effect,
8854.05 the effect of cognition, et cetera.
8857.26 When you open a bit and you go far out,
8859.72 you see certain things, not the truth,
8862.42 but maybe less delusion.
8865.75 There is nothing definite,
8868.0 but there is something
8871.39 maybe more wholesome that appears.
8878.5 Yeah, I think this is so this is a state,
8882.833 a state of exploration.
8885.67 I don't want to have the same
thought if I already had it,
8892.6 why would I want to have the same thought?
8894.37 I already had it.
8896.02 I don't want to have the same practice,
8898.636 I don't want to.
8900.13 I curled already in this way,
8902.29 I want to experience
something else, I want to.
8905.08 There is a benefit to gain,
8906.67 No, but that was better.
8909.61 The better is better,
8913.72 is not more, is not faster.
8916.39 It's like better is better,
8918.58 and better isn't, we don't
know what better is, right?
8921.343 So, it's like it's open.
8923.44 Oh, this is better, I don't know.
8925.72 It's just more weight, it's one more kilo,
8928.24 but maybe if I remove one kilo,
8931.81 I discover something like,
for example, power development
8937.03 that has been shown to
gain certain benefits
8940.09 when you lighten the load
and you accelerated more
8942.97 in certain conditions,
but who discovered it?
8945.01 A practitioner, a math person,
8948.7 not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky,
8951.43 they reported something,
8955.0 but it was already within the
grasp of the practitioners.
8959.177 And I think, and as a
researcher, this is very powerful
8964.63 to remind yourself this
and to work with that.
8967.357 And as a practitioner,
8968.41 as a living human being, for everyone,
8970.48 I think something very useful.
8972.64 And then, those plays that you're doing,
8977.29 people give you the weird looks,
8979.33 and it's like yeah, I tell people,
8981.767 "You don't want to be normal.
8985.03 If you don't get the weird looks,
8986.47 you're not moving in the right direction."
8989.23 You're moving in a very fixed
8992.98 and you already know the
result of that direction,
8995.65 let's say at least that.
8997.48 So, continue to play with
that, continue to play.
9000.99 Look elsewhere, look at
places you didn't look at
9003.57 because this is still like
within the same layer,
9005.52 one foot in front, one foot behind,
9007.89 what happens when you do it with a smile,
9010.95 the same workout, and when
you do it with a frown?
9016.26 Or what happens, breath
holding or blood restrictions,
9020.37 all this is great play,
9022.68 and I think very beneficial
to do, to go through.
9028.069 - Love it, I think that's
a wonderful message.
9031.11 And what I keep hearing
from you over and over again
9033.33 is that people should
explore, explore, explore.
9039.12 And listen, I want to thank
you for your time today,
9044.13 first of all, for the incredible teachings
9047.13 here at this table,
9048.24 but also the introduction
to a movement practice.
9052.14 Although, now I'm tempted to say
9053.22 that I've been moving my whole life,
9054.57 I just didn't know I was-
- It's true.
9056.19 - that it was such a vast landscape.
9059.61 Also, that your willingness to tread out
9062.16 in this journey that is truly unique.
9065.82 You know, that the greatest compliment
9067.26 that one can give in science
9068.58 is the one that I'm going to tell you now
9070.53 because it's entirely appropriate,
9071.79 which is we say you're an n-of-1, right?
9074.458 That and you truly are,
9076.08 I don't think there's anyone
9078.12 that has been as willing to
embrace existing practices,
9081.72 evolve them, create new practices,
9084.306 and to share so broadly

9168.18 Not on today's episode,
9169.29 but on many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
9171.84 we discuss supplements.
9173.34 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
9175.47 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them,
9177.54 or could derive tremendous
benefit from them.
9180.3 For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast
9182.19 has decided to partner with Momentous.
9184.68 We decided to partner with Momentous
9186.15 because, first of all,
9187.08 they are the absolute highest quality.
9189.0 Second of all, they ship
anywhere in the world.
9191.04 And third, we wanted to have one site
9193.08 that people could go to
9193.913 where they could find the supplements
9195.3 that are discussed on this podcast
9197.01 in the various dosages and
single ingredient forms
9199.71 that we often suggest or point
people to on the podcast.
9203.49 So, if you'd like to see
the supplements that I take,
9205.47 or that have been
mentioned on the podcast,
9207.42 please go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
9210.33 and they're listed there
as well as available there.
9212.88 If you're not already
following us on social media,
9215.25 we are @hubermanlab on
both Instagram and Twitter.
9218.73 Both places, I do short
posts about science
9221.1 and science-related tools,
9222.3 some of which overlap with the content
9223.89 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
9225.18 and other of which is distinct
9227.04 from the information on
the Huberman Lab Podcast.
9229.14 So, again, that's @hubermanlab on Twitter
9230.73 and @hubermanlab on Instagram.
9232.56 We also have a newsletter
that many people find useful.

9246.69 You can also get access
at the very same site
9249.27 to newsletters from the past
9251.25 to see if those newsletters
are indeed of interest to you.
9254.13 We have newsletters about a
toolkit for sleep, for instance,
9256.71 or a neuroplasticity super protocol
9259.05 that incorporates a lot of
different podcast episodes
