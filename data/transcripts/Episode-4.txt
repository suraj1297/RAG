0.179 welcome to the huberman lab guest Series
2.22 where I and an expert guest discuss
4.799 science and science-based tools for
6.66 everyday life
8.46 I'm Andrew huberman and I'm our
10.139 professor of neurobiology and
11.58 Ophthalmology at Stanford school of
13.38 medicine today marks the second episode
15.66 in the sixth episode series with Dr Andy
18.3 Galpin a professor of kinesiology at Cal
20.88 State University Fullerton and one of
22.92 the foremost world's experts on the
24.6 science and applications of methods to
26.699 increase strength hypertrophy and
28.439 endurance today's episode is all about
31.199 how to increase strength speed and
34.5 hypertrophy of muscles Professor Dr Andy
37.38 Galpin great to be back
39.239 last episode you told us about the nine
42.3 specific adaptations that exercise can
44.46 induce everything from strength and
46.14 hypertrophy to endurance muscular
47.64 endurance so on and so forth and you
49.68 gave us this incredible toolkit of fit
53.1 tests for each of those adaptations so
55.379 that people can assess them for
56.76 themselves and then of course improve on
58.98 each and every one of them if they
60.3 choose
61.079 by the way people can access that
62.579 information simply by going to the first
64.619 episode in this series with you and it's
67.08 all there and time stamped and I highly
69.36 recommend people do that today we're
71.34 talking about strength and hypertrophy
73.14 and so right out the gate I just want to
75.479 ask you why should people think about
78.299 and train for strengthen hypertrophy and
81.06 that question is of course directed
82.979 towards those that are trying to get
84.36 stronger and grow bigger muscles
86.4 but I know that many people out there
88.259 perhaps have not thought about the
90.36 benefits of strength and hypertrophy
91.74 training and how beneficial it can be
94.14 not just for people that want to get
96.18 bigger biceps Etc but that have other
99.84 goals longevity goals and health goals
102.6 unrelated to what most people associate
104.82 with hypertrophy so what are the
107.1 benefits of training for strength and
108.479 hypertrophy for the everyday person for
111.06 the athlete for the recreational
113.0 exerciser and so on there's a wonderful
116.1 saying I think it was Bill Bowerman the
118.68 founder one of the founders of Nike and
120.06 he always said if you have a body or an
121.5 athlete and and I think that's very
123.659 important for people to understand
124.56 because one of the major disservices
127.32 we've done in this field is convince
129.66 people that things like strength
131.58 training are for athletes or for growing
134.22 bigger muscles and cardiovascular
136.5 training are for things like fat loss
138.18 and heart health
139.86 and that is a tremendous disservice
142.02 because it puts a lot of unnecessary
144.12 barriers and leads to a lot of false
146.7 assumptions and then therefore poor
148.86 actions classic examples of this are
151.2 people who are resistant to strength
154.08 training because they don't want to put
155.16 on too much muscle people who only
157.86 perform one type of exercise because
159.78 they want say fat loss or they're in it
161.64 for longevity and health and they don't
163.62 work they're not worried about you know
164.879 being an athlete and so right out the
167.34 gates we can actually draw back a little
169.5 bit to what we were our previous
171.0 conversation when I walked you through
172.5 the history of exercise science and the
174.42 reason I did that is to help you
176.16 understand these are the railroads that
179.22 you're running down and you don't even
180.48 realize it in terms of everyone thinks
182.879 of strength training and they
184.08 immediately default to our principles to
187.2 optimize muscle growth and that's not
189.3 the only adaptation one should be after
191.22 with strength training when we think of
193.019 endurance training we immediately
194.22 default to things like again
195.9 cardiovascular health or fat loss or
197.94 things like that what I really want to
199.739 do across this entire series and
202.739 conversations is to to just break that
204.959 immediately talk about all the other
207.36 things that you can do with your with
209.7 your training and so that people can be
211.92 comfortable and confident in doing an
214.62 optimal training program for whatever
216.18 goal they have whether that be specific
217.98 like growing muscle or non-specific like
221.04 just feeling better having more energy
223.159 being more prepared for life and
225.379 Longevity and so to directly answer your
228.599 question I could really we could do a
230.58 hundred episodes on the benefits of
232.319 exercise and we could run all the way
233.879 from mood and focus cognitive tasks to a
238.92 better immune function you'll get less
240.72 colds you'll be you'll fight them off
242.58 more effectively to mortality right so
246.12 some of the strongest predictors of how
247.739 long and how well you will live are
249.06 exercise however
250.98 there are independent benefits that come
253.26 from just endurance training and there
255.0 are independent benefits that come from
256.56 strength training and so to just give
258.66 you one categorically the way that you
261.359 want to think about this is resistance
262.919 exercise and strength training is the
264.78 number one tool to combat neuromuscular
267.419 aging
268.62 you cannot get that through any other
271.02 form of exercise besides heavy overload
273.66 strength training and we and we can walk
275.94 through in detail what that is but that
277.56 is reason number one in general human
280.199 movement is is a function of number one
282.419 some sort of neuromuscular Activation so
284.759 nerves have to turn on the second part
287.16 is muscles have to contract and the
288.96 third part is those muscles have to move
290.82 a bone all right
292.38 if you want to be alive and you want to
294.66 live by yourself you have to be able to
296.94 engage in human movement
298.56 if you have
299.94 any dysfunction in the neuromuscular
301.62 system there then you're not going to be
303.24 able to do that and again as I mentioned
304.979 the only way to preserve that or fight
306.9 that loss of Aging is to strength train
309.66 so people will tend to hear numbers like
311.52 you lose about one percent of muscle
313.919 size per year after age about 40. and
317.639 that's true however what they don't
319.32 realize is you lose about two to four
321.24 percent of your strength
322.979 per year so the loss of strength is
325.979 almost double that
327.539 the loss of muscle mass with aging
329.34 muscle power is more like eight to ten
332.46 percent per year
333.72 and so we can very clearly see the
336.06 problem you're going to have with aging
337.5 is not going to be preservation of
339.18 muscle although that is incredibly
340.919 important it's going to be very
342.6 specifically preservation of muscle
344.22 power and strength and why that really
346.62 matters is your ability to again stand
349.199 up and move your ability to catch
351.12 yourself from a fall your ability to
352.74 feel confident doing a movement that is
356.039 a function of muscle power more than it
357.96 is muscle size and so functionality is
360.78 really what we want to be right you want
362.28 to be able to do whatever you want to be
363.96 do physically and feel confident in
366.36 doing that as you age that's going to
368.82 only be obtained through strength
370.68 training so is it appropriate to say
372.479 that training for strength and
373.86 hypertrophy is also a way to keep your
376.919 nervous system healthy and young
378.62 absolutely it is the only exercise route
381.78 we have for that if you look at just
385.199 basic numbers like motor units you're
386.699 going to see that older individuals have
388.5 like a 30 to 40 reduction in total motor
390.6 units So when you say older
393.419 approximately what ages are you
395.16 referring to because I know many people
396.66 out there such as myself are
399.479 40 and older but I know many of our
401.88 listeners are in their 20s maybe even in
403.86 their teens and I can imagine that
406.56 people that start doing strength and
408.12 hypertrophy training younger will afford
410.4 themselves an advantage over time but
412.86 that everybody should be doing strength
414.539 and hypertrophy training for as much of
416.88 their lifespan as possible that's really
418.319 the message that I'm getting so if
421.02 somebody is for instance 45 would that
424.38 fall into the bin of older you're going
426.479 to start seeing decrements passed again
428.46 around that age of 40 or so now there's
430.259 a lot of genetic variation there and a
432.3 lot of other things go into that
433.44 equation like your sleep and your
435.12 nutrition but that's a fair number to
436.86 sort of think about one actually
438.66 responses it's actually sort of
440.34 counterintuitive the wonderful thing
442.02 about strength training is you don't
444.78 actually have to start at a young age
447.479 uh you can actually in fact I was
449.22 reading a paper this morning because of
450.479 our previous conversation it was an over
452.46 age 90. so these are folks 90 plus and
456.36 they saw improvements like 30 to 170
459.18 percent in things like muscle size and
461.34 hypertrophy over a very short period of
463.139 time I think it was 12 weeks so you
465.78 don't actually have to start there are
467.819 some adaptations that you're going to
469.139 need for health that you God you really
471.12 need to start in your 20s the reason I
473.22 like to mention that is because if you
474.599 are listening and you are 50 and you're
476.22 like oh [ __ ] I I haven't been strength
478.139 training you're not toast like you
480.599 should absolutely start now
482.819 um but you're going to be able to get to
484.199 a fantastic spot
486.479 very quickly
488.22 similarly though if you are 20 or 25 and
491.16 30 and you aren't lifting there are
492.84 still many reasons why you should do
494.28 that now and I I'd like to point that
496.38 out because a lot of folks will be like
497.819 oh my gosh they said I have to do it
500.099 when I'm 20 or 25 or you know I'll be
502.919 sort of screwed and that's not the case
504.0 at all there's really no age limit on
506.28 this in fact there's actually
507.06 interesting data that just came out
508.979 showing this reduction in muscle
512.039 strength and I perjury that I sort of
513.839 talked about is basically ameliorated
515.58 with a preservation of activity in other
518.339 words you don't lose these
520.02 functionalities because of Aging you
521.7 lose these because of a loss of training
523.62 to state that again you don't lose these
526.02 because of some innate physiological
528.18 thing that happens with genes become
530.64 less sensitive or you lose functionality
532.56 you pretty much can describe the loss of
535.44 function of strength and muscle and
537.3 aging as exclusively because of a loss
539.519 of training and nutrition and anabolic
541.44 resistance and some other things so
543.54 you can do a lot more than you think
545.54 when it comes to maintaining high
547.74 quality muscle and that's really
549.42 important to point out I'm reminded of
551.94 the words of the great sharington he won
555.24 the Nobel Prize he's a physiologist I
557.58 guess the neuroscientists try and claim
558.959 him as a neuroscientist because he
560.22 worked on the nervous system the
561.24 physiologists claim as a as a
562.56 physiologist he is 100 a physiologist I
565.26 would call him a neuroscientist maybe we
566.94 can argue about this later
568.92 um we will but I think one of the key
572.459 things that sharington pointed out was
575.279 that I believe the quote was that
577.38 movement is the final common path and
579.66 what he was referring to was the fact
581.64 that a significant fraction of the brain
584.279 itself is devoted to our ability to move
586.98 and our ability to engage in resistance
590.399 type movements and that resistance type
593.399 movements and the continuation of
595.62 movement throughout the lifespan
597.6 is what keeps the brain young and
599.82 healthy and vital and there are so much
602.519 data now to support that but I'm so
605.519 grateful that you brought up early this
607.14 fact that there's a neuromuscular link
609.959 because I think a lot of people think
611.22 about musculoskeletal they forget that
614.1 the nervous system is really in charge
615.66 of the um strength of the muscle
617.58 contractions and the types of muscle
619.8 contractions that occur I'm certain
621.779 we're going to get into that in a lot of
623.04 depth today you're close there we're not
624.839 totally right but we're close Okay well
626.519 I look forward to being corrected
628.56 um and to achieving the Precision that
630.42 you're known for uh around that
632.1 discussion so if we are to step back and
635.82 say strength training and hypertrophy
637.56 training is critical for people of all
639.06 ages yeah
640.32 for developing and maintaining the
643.62 neuromuscular system and for
646.26 our ability to function in the world
647.88 yeah
648.959 not just offset injury but the ability
650.7 to pick things up and move Etc
652.86 what are some of the other things that
654.42 strengthen hypertrophy training can
656.459 provide I know a lot of people use
659.88 strength and hypertrophy training for
661.68 changing their Aesthetics what is your
664.14 sense about its potency for changing
666.48 Aesthetics as compared to say
668.22 cardiovascular exercise yeah the the
670.56 Mantra I always like is the reason you
672.959 want to exercise is threefold right you
674.64 want to look good feel good play good
675.839 that that's really that comes from sport
678.2 comes from football specifically we
681.12 always say that and what that means
682.26 really is you want to look good people
683.82 want to look the way they want to look
685.5 whatever that means to them and there
687.48 are any versions of what you feel to be
689.22 aesthetically pleasing and that's
691.079 totally irrelevant but people want to
693.0 look the way they want to look number
694.92 two you want to be able to feel good
696.24 what's that mean you want to be injury
697.68 free you want to have energy throughout
699.06 the day you want to be able to execute
700.32 anything you want to so whether you want
702.24 to go surf in the morning you want to
703.62 play racquetball you want to hike or you
705.18 want to do all three of those in one day
706.68 you should have the ability to do that
708.36 and then you want to play good which
710.1 means you should be able to execute any
712.38 again activities that you want to
714.6 execute whatever that means all right so
716.04 backing all up what's that got to do
717.779 with your question
719.7 um one of the major benefits of strength
721.86 training is the responses tend to happen
724.019 extremely fast so you can see noticeable
726.42 changes in muscle size certainly within
728.22 a month absolutely within six weeks and
730.98 so we have this wonderful feedback loop
733.38 that sort of tells you am I doing the
735.36 same correctly
736.62 oh my gosh yes I am also it's very
739.079 addicting the feedback the response the
741.36 physical changes whether this is
743.279 actually point two or three look good or
745.26 feel good play good or it's even just
746.88 part one you're starting to see that
748.74 when you compare that to things like fat
750.6 loss that Journey tends to be longer
752.82 it's more difficult it's more Reliant
754.92 upon other factors like nutrition
757.68 Etc strength training is really about
759.06 like there's some very minimal nutrition
761.579 requirements outside of that it comes
763.5 down to the training and the feedback is
765.54 immediate that's powerful because if you
768.12 look across the literature on exercise
769.98 adherence you'll see that that is in
772.68 fact the number one predictor of
774.899 effectiveness of any training program
777.36 so what that means is if you were to put
779.82 any variable possible and figure out
781.8 what is going to determine
783.66 whether or not this program works this
786.42 is what we typically call the methods or
788.459 many in the concepts are few so the
790.139 methods of exercise the methods of
791.7 strength training the mess of the
793.38 methods of hypertrophy training which
794.7 we'll talk about are are infinite
796.86 however there are only a handful of key
799.5 Concepts that you have to achieve in
801.12 order for that program to work adherence
803.1 is one of them and again is often the
805.38 top one so you need to do something you
807.6 need to do something consistently
809.519 when you are getting that feedback and
811.2 you're seeing results in your appearance
812.7 immediately and you see that every
814.32 single day every time you take off your
816.42 shirt or every time you look in the
818.639 mirror you see that result that tends to
820.44 drive adherence
821.7 um really powerfully so it's important
823.74 to give people wins especially people
825.36 who are not maybe like you and I who are
827.339 like I'm gonna lift weights and I'm
829.38 gonna exercise like no matter what the
831.24 rest of my life because I just love it
832.92 not everyone's like that and so giving
835.32 them a little bit of carrot of success
836.7 and if you can achieve that in you know
838.74 say three to four to five weeks already
840.26 it's very powerful tool before we begin
842.94 I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
844.5 is separate from my teaching and
845.94 research roles at Stanford it is also
847.92 separate from Dr galpin's teaching and
849.48 research roles at Cal State Fullerton it
851.82 is however part of our desire and effort
853.56 to bring zero cost to Consumer
854.82 information about science and science
856.5 related tools to the general public in
858.72 keeping with that theme we'd like to
860.22 thank the sponsors of today's podcast
861.839 our first sponsor is momentous momentous
865.079 makes supplements of the absolute
866.579 highest quality the huberman Lab podcast
868.86 is proud to be partnering with momentous
870.959 for several important reasons first of
872.94 all as I mentioned their supplements are
874.38 of extremely high quality second of all
876.3 their supplements are generally in
878.519 single ingredient formulations if you're
880.62 going to develop a supplementation
881.88 protocol you're going to want to focus
883.68 mainly on using single ingredient
885.18 formulations with single ingredient
886.92 formulations you can devise the most
889.26 logical and effective and cost-effective
891.48 supplementation regimen for your goals
893.699 in addition momentous supplement ship
895.44 internationally and this is of course
897.0 important because we realize that many
898.44 of the huberman Lab podcast listeners
900.0 reside outside the United States if
902.279 you'd like to try the various
903.24 supplements mentioned on the huberman
904.56 Lab podcast in particular supplements
906.72 for Hormone Health for Sleep
908.339 optimization for Focus as well as a
910.62 number of other things including
911.639 exercise recovery you can go to live
913.62 momentous spelled ous so that's
915.36 livemomentis.com huberman today's
917.94 episode is also brought To Us by eight
919.74 sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress
921.899 covers with cooling Heating and sleep
923.639 tracking capacity I've been using an
925.56 eight-sleep mattress cover for about the
927.24 last eight months and it has completely
929.1 trans formed my sleep I'm sleeping about
931.5 the same amount but I'm sleeping far
933.42 deeper and I'm now getting the proper
935.16 ratios of so-called rapid eye movement
937.139 or REM sleep and slow wave sleep and
938.94 waking up feeling far more recovered
940.86 mentally and physically the underlying
942.899 mechanism for all that is very
944.76 straightforward I've talked many times
946.199 before on this podcast and elsewhere
947.82 about the critical relationship between
949.56 sleep and body temperature that is in
952.38 order to fall asleep at night your body
953.94 needs to drop by about one to three
955.5 degrees in terms of core body
956.82 temperature and waking up involves a one
959.399 to three degree increase in core body
961.079 temperature with eight Sleep mattress
962.76 covers you can adjust the temperature of

998.82 levels is a program that lets you see
1000.62 how different foods and activities
1002.18 affect your health by giving you
1003.68 real-time feedback on your blood glucose
1005.66 using a continuous glucose monitor many
1008.18 people are aware that their blood sugar
1009.98 that is their blood glucose level is
1012.139 critical for everything from Fat Loss to
1015.38 muscle gain to healthy cognition and
1017.899 indeed aging of the brain and body most
1020.779 people do not know however how different
1022.639 foods and different activities including
1024.86 exercise or different temperature
1027.079 environments impact their blood glucose
1029.12 levels and yet blood glucose is
1030.74 exquisitely sensitive to all of those
1032.66 things I first started using levels
1034.819 about a year ago as a way to understand
1036.919 how different foods exercise and timing
1039.74 of food relative to exercise and quality
1041.839 of sleep at night impact my blood
1043.459 glucose levels and I've learned a
1045.14 tremendous amount from using levels it's
1047.959 taught me when best to eat what best to
1050.6 eat when best to exercise how best to
1053.059 exercise and how to modulate my entire
1055.76 schedule from work to exercise and even
1058.52 my sleep so if you're interested in
1060.2 learning more about levels and trying a
1061.88 continuous glucose monitor yourself go
1063.919 to levels.link huberman that's
1066.34 levels.link huberman let's talk about
1069.08 strength and hypertrophy
1071.0 if you would please remind us what
1074.0 strength and hypertrophy are in terms of
1076.88 the specific adaptation they represent
1079.58 what I mean by that is when somebody is
1081.44 training for strength what are they
1083.6 really training for obviously it means
1085.82 the ability to move more weight but I
1088.7 know that it includes a number of other
1090.32 things as well and when one is training
1092.48 for hypertrophy for the growth of muscle
1095.539 fibers
1096.799 what does that represent because I think
1099.679 if people understand that they will far
1102.02 better understand the methods and
1103.64 protocols that are going to be best for
1105.44 strength and hypertrophy at its core
1107.12 you've basically described it when we
1108.799 talk about strength we're talking about
1110.179 an actual function so can you create
1112.76 more Force across a muscle or muscle
1115.16 groups or our total movement and when we
1117.74 talk about hypertrophy now we're
1119.179 specifically referring to just an
1120.38 increase in size there's no actual
1121.88 mention of function so a muscle can grow
1125.78 larger without actually technically
1127.58 being stronger for a number of reasons
1129.94 however there is a strong relationship
1132.919 between strength and hypertrophy so a
1134.72 lot of the times in the general public
1136.28 in the lay conversations we sort of lump
1139.039 those two things in it's the same thing
1140.84 and so we have to recognize people who
1143.299 are new to training or people even are
1146.2 intermediately trained there is a huge
1148.76 overlap between strength and our perjury
1151.28 once you get past that though they
1153.799 become disentangled and a good example
1155.84 of it is this if you look at the
1158.179 strongest people in the world this would
1159.559 be people who compete in the sport of
1161.24 power lifting
1162.38 right that's a true test of maximal
1164.299 strength so it is a deadlift a bench
1166.52 press and a back squat and you're going
1168.32 to do a one repetition Max in all three
1169.94 of those and so whoever wins is the
1171.559 person who lifted the most amount of
1172.82 weight one time that's it it's not like
1175.28 World's Strongest Man where it is how
1176.96 many reps can you do in a row or your
1178.52 time right is a true maximal strength
1180.74 test and you compare those to say
1183.02 bodybuilders now both of those
1185.84 individuals are strong and both of those
1189.26 individuals have a lot of muscle however
1191.419 it is extremely clear the power lifters
1193.88 will be significantly stronger
1196.34 than the bodybuilders on average right
1198.98 there are individual exceptions but
1200.72 we're just talking Collective averages
1202.22 and the bodybuilders will have more
1204.5 muscle than the other ones in addition
1207.2 whether you look at Olympic
1208.82 weightlifting or power lifting or
1211.1 world's strongest man for that matter
1212.299 there are weight classes and the reason
1214.4 is as you go up in weight classes you
1216.799 will always see the world records go
1219.08 higher and higher and higher right so
1220.76 you can clearly get stronger without
1224.0 adding any muscle however there's a
1227.299 point right where you simply have to add
1229.94 more mass to get a higher number and
1231.86 that's why we have weight classes in
1233.78 those Sports and in Combat Sports and
1235.4 lots of other things so
1236.84 we have there's a lot of confusion right
1238.76 because people think man either these
1241.1 are the same thing or if I want to get
1244.1 stronger I have to get bigger which is
1245.96 not the case at all another misnomer
1248.179 here is I can't get stronger
1250.88 unless I add muscle that's not true
1252.74 either right it's a similar idea
1255.26 so what I'm saying is you have the
1256.88 ability to do whatever you'd like if
1258.5 you'd like to get stronger and add
1260.179 muscle
1261.38 great if you add muscle you're probably
1264.44 going to bring some strength along for
1266.419 the ride
1267.26 however if you want to get stronger and
1270.38 you don't want to add muscle for any
1272.059 reason personal preference on Aesthetics
1274.76 whether you're in a weight class and you
1276.62 simply can't afford it it is quite easy
1278.539 to get stronger and not add much muscle
1280.28 mass either and so differentiating these
1282.86 two things is one of them is simply a
1284.66 measure of size and the other one is a
1286.82 measure of force and when we talk about
1289.64 strength what we're really talking about
1291.14 are two unique components component one
1293.539 is what I call the physiology so what it
1295.88 what is the ability of the neuromuscular
1297.62 system what is the ability of the muscle
1300.08 fibers to contract and produce Force the
1303.02 other one is what we call mechanics and
1304.88 mechanics is simply things like it's
1307.22 minutia down to how long your femurs are
1310.4 relative to your tibia or or other
1313.039 things like this is biomechanics this is
1315.02 also technique this is skill this is how
1318.14 smooth you feel this is are you firing
1320.78 the right muscle group in the right
1322.94 sequence and Order and all of these
1325.039 things play into strength so somebody
1326.539 who maybe has more Force capability in
1330.2 their muscle fibers but their technique
1332.299 in the movement is worse may lose in a
1334.7 competition or somebody again who's
1337.64 um like if you go into the world of
1339.44 speed and power especially you'll hear a
1341.72 lot of people talk about like the Rhythm
1343.1 and there's just a certain Rhythm that
1344.78 has to happen if you want to jump as
1346.28 high as possible or run as fast as fast
1347.96 as possible but that's all mechanics at
1350.36 this fundamental level so when we look
1352.22 at hypertrophy
1354.02 it's just still simply about how big the
1356.36 muscle is
1357.62 so those are the really the the
1359.059 similarities and distinctions between
1360.98 strength and hypertrophy when strength
1363.98 improves
1365.539 and when hypertrophy increases
1369.38 is there also involvement in the
1373.46 ligaments and tendons that is of course
1376.46 the ligaments and tendons are involved
1378.26 in the movements and yeah but do
1380.72 ligaments and tendons themselves grow
1383.299 and or get stronger
1385.4 this field is really difficult because
1388.179 connective tissue is not vascular and so
1391.7 their plasticity is significantly lower
1393.919 than skeletal muscle in fact if you look
1395.6 across all the organs a skeletal muscle
1397.64 is one of if not the most plastic
1399.26 meaning it's the most pliable the most
1401.48 responsive the one that's going to
1403.34 adjust it's basically it's paying
1404.9 attention to everything that's being
1406.52 said in the body you cannot change blood
1409.22 pressure or pH or
1411.94 macronutrients floating around without
1413.78 muscle knowing about it it is in fact
1416.179 this is why we call muscle an organ
1418.039 people don't tend to think about this if
1419.6 you were ever on like Jeopardy and they
1421.7 ask you that question like what's the
1422.96 biggest organ system in the body people
1424.58 tend to say the skin muscle is actually
1427.7 the correct answer all right well I'm
1429.14 going to cite you when I get it yeah
1431.919 Jeopardy I don't have any immediate
1433.94 plans to go on Jeopardy but who knows oh
1435.74 there you go Celebrity Jeopardy Angie
1437.48 huberman wait I don't know about the
1439.1 celebrity part but uh Jeopardy would be
1440.96 fun yeah um but I will say the muscle
1443.299 and I'll I'll if you get a phone call in
1445.46 Jeopardy I don't know I haven't seen
1446.419 that show in a very long time yeah uh
1448.039 maybe ever then I'll I'll call you but
1450.2 that makes sense
1451.52 um so that muscles would be the largest
1453.26 organ system in the body the reason I
1454.7 was saying that is so muscle is both
1456.08 listening and talking it is controlling
1458.6 uh the immune system a lot it's
1460.82 controlling blood glucose regulation it
1462.919 is it is the central Depot for uh amino
1466.64 acids which are needed to do things like
1469.039 regulate the immune system build any new
1472.1 red blood cells a lot of this stuff is
1473.48 coming from skeletal muscle so when we
1476.179 say organ by the way that's actually
1477.44 like a physiological definition so
1479.36 something that's communicating uh to
1481.34 either another organ itself or uh
1483.32 throughout the system so it's listening
1485.24 and it's talking connective tissue is
1487.28 not the same way and so we do see
1489.38 adaptations with strength training in
1492.14 connective tissue
1493.64 it's just much lower it's difficult to
1495.74 measure effectively what we know now is
1498.74 you're going to have a combination of
1500.6 adaptations throughout the connective
1502.1 tissue it is beneficial this is probably
1504.2 one of the major reasons that's that
1506.059 strength training reduces injury risk
1507.559 which is very very important because
1509.12 people who tend to want to pick up an
1511.28 exercise routine after say 10 years the
1515.0 classic cliche is like I played all
1516.98 these things in high school then I went
1518.78 to college got a job now I'm 25 or 35 or
1521.78 whatever and you sort of want to jump
1523.4 back into what you did when you were 20.
1525.62 well there's no tissue tolerance left
1527.24 and what we almost always mean by that
1529.279 is connective tissue the tolerance in
1531.62 there is not ready for the load you're
1533.36 about to handle and so you go through
1535.1 some movement and then boom sprains
1537.559 tears
1539.12 um you know even like the more
1540.5 significant ones are on Achilles tear
1542.24 which is going to really sideline you so
1543.98 those are some of the problems and we
1545.059 know strength training as a large role
1547.88 in injury reduction for stress and
1549.799 strain and overuse injuries and that's
1551.12 specifically coming from the connective
1552.5 tissue adaptations again the difficult
1554.419 part here is
1555.98 it's very hard to assess we actually
1558.679 um when I was a doctoral student we
1560.6 played around with patella tendon
1562.64 biopsies so I actually had one this is
1565.039 like a there's a little piece of your
1566.299 patella tendon missing yeah because your
1568.7 own yeah own lab so now I've probably
1570.919 had
1571.94 I don't know how many hundreds of
1573.32 biopsies I've performed on people
1575.299 um probably well over a thousand
1576.38 certainly well over a thousand I've
1578.12 probably had 35 or 40 done in myself
1581.08 there's no problem here I have no Scar
1583.159 Tissue I have no loss of function and
1584.84 I've stuck needles in every leg like all
1586.88 over myself right quads uh my Soleus
1590.48 gastroc like all up taking tissue out
1592.58 yeah you want the needle looks like a
1594.62 pen basically and you you know you're
1596.36 alive and you go in and grab a chunk and
1597.62 you pull it out and can I come to your
1599.539 lab and get biopsy absolutely yeah
1601.1 you're probably looking under the
1602.36 microscope it'll just look like the
1603.799 molecule caffeine there's a there's a
1606.919 mutual friend of ours who came down and
1609.08 did that he's a big big big gentleman
1611.36 big into lifting very into strength
1613.58 training uh and he he went through that
1616.82 experience and he was like oh my gosh it
1619.039 was not what he was hoping to get he
1620.72 actually had
1621.88 unbelievable muscle morphology his
1624.2 fibers were the diameter of muscle
1626.36 fibers is extremely large it's one of
1628.46 the biggest cells by volume in all the
1629.9 biology skeletal muscle and human and
1632.24 how large I can't help myself
1634.58 um millimeters
1636.02 well you so you have length right and
1638.0 then you have width right so lengthwise
1639.5 it can be extraordinarily long you can
1641.179 be the classic example is like your
1643.22 Sartorius which is like the front of
1644.9 your hip to the inside of your kneecap
1646.46 theoretically those cells can run the
1648.44 entire length which would be one muscle
1650.419 fiber running that thing if I were to do
1652.7 a biopsy on you and I and I pulled that
1654.74 tissue out I could actually pull an
1656.12 individual fiber out with tweezers and
1657.74 hold it up and you could see that whole
1659.659 muscle cell yeah I'm definitely not
1661.039 going to get biopsy um you'd be stunned
1663.5 how big they are anyways his was the
1665.059 size of a rhino so the diameter of his
1667.34 now he has a well-documented assistance
1670.34 in the area of muscle growth we'll say
1673.52 um but yeah those can be large so what
1676.34 were we even talking about there well I
1677.72 was asking about tendons and ligaments
1679.76 um because I'd like to understand the
1681.799 various tissues and organ systems that
1683.6 adapt when one gets stronger when muscle
1685.46 tissue grows and I I do want to ask
1687.32 about bone yeah um and here I'm not
1689.9 referring to Bone mineral density what I
1692.659 was going to ask is whether or not
1694.34 bone itself can grow and get stronger
1697.22 and the reason I'm asking is there's a
1698.659 favorite result of mine I have about
1700.7 3 800 favorite results 3 000 pet peeves
1703.7 and 3 800 plus favorite results
1706.7 um but one of my favorite results is
1708.5 from Eric kindel's Lab at Columbia Eric
1711.02 won the Nobel Prize for learning and
1712.46 memory and his laboratory got really
1713.84 into the effects of exercise on learning
1715.52 and memory yeah and they had this
1717.08 incredible result
1719.299 which is that
1721.34 load-bearing exercise yeah stimulates
1724.039 the bones to release something called
1726.52 osteocalcin excuse me and then
1728.539 osteocalcin acts as a more or less a
1730.7 hormone travels to the brain and
1732.08 enhances the memory systems in the brain
1733.7 by enhancing neuron Health that's the
1735.679 basic Crux of of the studies there were
1737.659 several of these and
1739.7 The Moment I Saw the first of those
1742.1 studies I thought well here's another
1743.36 reason to do resistance type exercise
1745.88 and not just aerobic exercise and then
1748.76 it brings to mind whether or not bones
1750.62 themselves get stronger when we do
1753.02 resistance training I don't know the
1754.64 answer to that yeah that's very clearly
1756.919 demonstrated and we've known that for
1758.659 for many decades
1760.22 um you have a
1762.2 a diminishing ability to do so with age
1764.98 particularly you need to do this in your
1767.899 teens and 20s this is where you're going
1769.46 to have the largest ability to enhance
1770.96 bone mineral density and it's
1773.059 particularly responsive to axial loading
1774.98 now I'm a muscle guy I'm not a bone
1777.02 specialist so we would have to consult
1779.24 somebody who can give you more position
1780.44 here but that's you explain axial
1782.0 loading it's up and down it's vertical
1783.679 okay so it's almost like a like a
1785.84 cylinder putting the weight of the on
1787.64 the small end of the cylinder on both
1789.74 small end of the cylinders yeah if
1791.179 someone doesn't do this in their 20s or
1793.399 teens however
1795.02 can we assume that some degree of
1797.84 positive change will occur if they do
1799.279 resistance training even if it's a small
1801.26 fraction the answer is yes it is small
1804.1 we have worked with a number of women in
1806.84 our
1808.039 um our rapid health program that come in
1810.74 and they are in their 20s and they're in
1812.72 their 30s and they have significant bone
1814.159 marrow density problems and eight months
1816.08 later we can see noticeable changes that
1818.24 are outside of the measurement error of
1821.179 a positive change positive changes
1823.279 correct and if you worked with the there
1825.38 are many Physicians that specialize in
1826.7 this area you you're going to need a
1829.039 Nutri nutrition here strengthening alone
1831.98 is probably not going to get you there
1833.419 particularly with women because you have
1835.039 to figure out why and and there's a lot
1838.1 going on with the physiology and
1839.48 biochemistry so you probably like almost
1842.12 surely needed to have some blood
1843.32 chemistry done with that you have to
1845.72 figure out what's going on menstrual
1846.98 cycle wise in fact like oftentimes what
1848.779 we'll do
1849.799 for our women very specifically is we
1852.62 use a thing called The Rhythm plus a
1854.299 30-day test so you can actually do a
1855.86 salivary test across the entire
1857.24 menstrual cycle and you can take uh
1859.58 samples it's about every other day so
1861.2 you get 15 or 16 samples and you get a
1863.899 really beautiful picture of what's
1865.039 Happening hormonally across the entire
1867.34 menstrual cycle and that's really really
1869.48 important because typically for women if
1872.779 you get a single sample or simple time
1874.76 Point whether it's salivary urine or
1876.98 blood you can have
1879.26 um well like a order of magnitude
1881.36 difference in any number of metrics
1883.159 because of what phase are in this is one
1885.44 of the many reasons why it's been such a
1887.0 challenge to do a lot of physiology
1888.559 research with females some metrics
1891.44 change throughout the menstrual cycle
1894.08 others don't like strength is a very
1895.94 good example I can strengthen and I can
1898.159 do a one rep max test on a woman at any
1900.32 point I don't have to do that at a
1902.179 certain phase of their menstrual cycle
1903.44 because it's the evidence I think is
1905.0 pretty clear at this point that number
1906.919 won't change so I have no qualms
1909.02 including female files in any of my
1910.82 studies where strength is an absolute is
1913.22 an important dependent variable because
1914.72 I don't have to adjust around menstrual
1916.1 cycle other factors like anything in in
1919.52 blood anything hormone related you're
1921.14 going to have to automatically account
1922.279 for it so what I would say is those
1925.58 folks should absolutely work with a
1926.96 qualified physician and you you're going
1929.6 to have to get some nutrition
1930.98 supplementation potentially and then
1933.5 maybe even some other stuff going on to
1935.24 make that even more complicated
1937.52 if you're on any form of birth control
1939.32 or not that's going to change the entire
1941.48 equation especially if it's a
1942.559 hormone-based birth control so it just
1944.48 gets really really complicated to answer
1947.12 it though you can see adaptations they
1950.24 are significantly diminished relative to
1952.64 if you would have started in your teens
1953.84 and 20s but there is hope you just need
1955.76 to work with somebody who specializes in
1957.14 that area
1958.52 so for both men and women boys and girls
1962.72 what are the major adaptations that
1965.96 occur to underlie improvements in
1968.36 strength and if you would if you could
1970.279 just provide a bullet point list of that
1972.919 and then we can dive into each of those
1974.72 in detail
1977.059 for instance
1978.98 are nerves getting more efficient at
1981.44 firing our bones enjoying adaptations in
1984.5 different yeah bone connective tissue
1987.08 relationships that that underlie
1989.12 strength I have to imagine all these
1990.62 things are happening but what are the
1991.76 the major changes that are occurring in
1993.799 those Origins and organ systems that
1995.179 reflect someone's ability to on one day
1997.88 lift you know 100 pounds and then a week
2001.299 later to lift uh 105 pounds now I'll try
2005.14 to keep this condensed again this could
2006.46 be an entire University course
2009.059 I will also try to give you a little bit
2011.62 of Bones here so normally as a muscle
2013.48 guy I only I take all the credit and
2015.46 muscle
2016.299 turns out the nervous system gets a
2018.519 little bit of credit too here thank you
2020.64 so as we walk through it just in as a
2023.98 big picture if we think about again what
2025.36 causes human movement basically
2027.22 everything along that chain will improve
2030.039 the strength training and I'm not really
2032.08 being using too much hyperbole there
2034.12 it's quite impressive so it's going from
2037.299 the nervous system side of the equation
2038.32 what has to happen for human movement is
2040.179 a nerve has to send a signal through a
2042.039 motor unit now a motor unit is comes
2045.039 down and interface multiple muscle
2046.419 fibers so if you think about your actual
2048.339 muscle it's not a thing it is a
2050.619 component of many individual muscle
2052.119 fibers so you've got millions if not
2053.619 more think of it like a ponytail so we
2056.44 collectively say ponytail and you think
2058.0 of it as like one thing but really a
2059.8 ponytail is a combination of tons of
2061.78 individual hairs okay muscles the same
2064.659 way so this motor unit comes in and
2066.879 innervates a lot of different muscle
2068.619 fibers now every one of the fibers in a
2070.72 motor unit is generally of the same
2072.339 fiber type so fast switch or slow twitch
2074.679 and they are not laid out next to each
2076.899 other in the muscle they are spread out
2078.159 across horizontally vertically as well
2081.099 as closer to the Bone and further to the
2083.679 surface so they're moved throughout the
2085.359 entire way and this is what allows you
2086.679 to have smoother contractions and you
2088.06 don't have spasticity and things like
2089.44 that so we see improvements from the
2091.599 neuromuscular side like firing rate we
2093.879 see synchronization improvements um that
2096.82 are coming in you also see improvements
2099.58 in things like acetylcholine release
2101.8 from the presynaptic neuron so you're
2104.38 getting it faster we see calcium
2105.76 recycling is improved back uh to there
2108.64 so in order for without walking into too
2111.339 much of the biochemistry in order for a
2112.78 signal to go from nerve to muscle
2114.16 there's a little bit of a gap there's a
2115.839 physical space that happens and what
2117.52 happens is you release this molecule
2118.9 called acetylcholine this goes into the
2120.88 postsynaptic left and then that actually
2122.26 binds to a receptor that receptor
2124.839 actually opens up a door that lets
2127.18 sodium in that's really what's happening
2129.099 so it's not the acetylcholine without
2130.359 acetylcholine then sits on that receptor
2132.22 site it's broken down put back in and
2135.339 recycled back up in the presynaptic
2137.079 nerve site the faster you can do that
2138.94 the faster you can recycle that signal
2142.119 and so almost everything that I describe
2145.0 in that entire system improves and has
2147.46 been shown to to increase with training
2149.859 so that alone is given to give you
2152.14 benefits we haven't even walked into to
2154.54 getting from an electrical signal now
2156.579 into an action potential which is going
2158.56 to cause a muscle contraction
2160.48 so getting from nerve into the muscle we
2163.66 see everything from improvements when we
2165.82 call contractility which means the
2167.8 muscle fiber themselves can produce more
2169.66 force or more velocity independent of
2172.359 muscle size changes this is another
2174.579 component when we ask like well how is
2176.26 it I got stronger
2177.7 without getting bigger well in the
2180.4 muscle fiber itself its ability to
2182.74 contract Force increases and this is
2184.96 because we have everything like the
2186.04 sarcoplasmic reticulum which is the
2187.78 place that stores and releases the
2189.04 calcium which is what's needed for this
2191.5 entire cross-bridge interaction from the
2193.96 myosin and actin to happen I know a lot
2196.42 I just lost a lot of people but you can
2198.579 go look at some of these images the
2199.8 sarcoplasmatricium gets gets activated
2202.78 more it gets more sensitive it is better
2204.28 at releasing calcium bringing it back in
2206.32 and doing it again the bond between the
2209.5 crossbridge the myosin actin gets
2211.48 stronger the calcium Affinity is the
2214.78 phrase that we use there increases so
2218.2 we're literally walking through almost
2219.7 the entire process of skeletal muscle
2221.44 contraction here and every step along
2223.18 the way we we see improvements so that
2225.16 net result is we see again more Force
2228.28 production independent of any change in
2230.44 size independent of any increase in
2232.42 contractile units we didn't add anything
2234.28 to the equation we didn't change size we
2236.74 did nothing but improve efficiency
2238.98 effectively independent of that now we
2242.02 can actually start talking about
2242.92 changing muscle fiber type so we can
2245.2 change our fibers from a slow twitch
2246.82 fiber to a fast twitch fiber that alone
2248.92 is going to give you more forced
2250.119 production again independent of size
2251.56 fast switch fibers 10 to be larger than
2254.44 Soul touch fibers but not always
2256.619 especially in the presence of endurance
2259.119 training so if you do a lot of
2260.56 consistent endurance training it's very
2262.359 common for us to find slow touch fibers
2264.099 that are as similar size if not larger
2266.619 often very often larger than those fast
2269.44 touch fibers if you take slow fibers big
2272.74 slow very metabolically effective
2274.68 vibrous so extremely fatigue resistant
2277.06 so it's not a bad thing to call them
2279.16 slow is like we tend to say fastest low
2281.14 and slow has this negative connotation
2282.94 but it's like quite healthy like fiber
2285.82 type to have outside of that now we
2288.52 haven't even gotten into things like
2289.72 penation angle so this is an angle at
2291.579 which your muscle fibers interact with
2293.14 your bone so we tend to think about this
2295.18 as like a muscle fiber is pulling on a
2296.98 muscle well some some of these are
2298.839 oriented are almost a 90 degree so a
2301.359 fiber runs perpendicular into the bone
2303.28 and some of them are closer to like a 45
2304.839 degree and some of them are closer to
2306.76 almost parallel and that confers a lot
2309.339 of unique mechanical benefits so in one
2311.859 area it's actually going to increase
2313.3 Force production you go the other
2315.22 direction increases velocity and so we
2317.98 have all kinds of changes in the angle
2319.54 at which the muscle inserts into the
2321.16 bone now we're already on the mechanic
2323.26 side of it right so we've we've
2324.579 influenced how effectively it pulls and
2327.52 with any of these things it's always a
2328.96 give and take so you're going to give up
2330.52 in the case of a Nation angle you're
2331.839 going to give up strength but you're
2333.04 going to increase of a lot shortening
2334.119 velocity or if you want to increase the
2336.099 velocity you're going to give up sort of
2337.839 the strength right we haven't gotten to
2340.18 any of the energetics at all so we
2342.16 haven't talked about increasing storage
2343.839 of phosphocreatine which is the energy
2346.2 system needed to power that muscle
2348.52 contraction at the fastest possible rate
2350.2 so we can continue to go as long as you
2352.24 want here but hopefully you're getting
2353.619 the point of a little bit of the
2355.06 adaptations that occur the reason I want
2358.119 to actually why I think that stuff is
2359.859 important to bring it back maybe for
2361.78 some Muslims I know I took you on a
2363.04 journey there and you're just like what
2363.94 the hell just happened
2365.5 that matters because again this is the
2367.42 specific explanation for how is it
2369.22 possible that I got stronger but I
2370.839 didn't get bigger and this is also why
2373.42 strength and hypertrophy are intertwined
2376.24 and heavily overlapped but are not
2378.22 necessarily the same thing so for
2380.2 example we can increase muscle size
2383.14 and actually reduce strength because of
2385.96 what's called lattice spacing so what
2388.06 happens is you have to kind of remember
2390.4 your muscle fibers are these long
2391.9 cylinders and the way that they contract
2394.2 requires an optimal space and so what
2396.94 happens is you have this molecule called
2398.44 actin and you have this molecule called
2400.599 myosin myosin sits in the middle and
2403.839 there are six actin that surround each
2406.119 individual myosin in a three-dimensional
2408.579 Circle here so you got a myosin in the
2410.98 middle that has all these globular heads
2412.48 and they can reach up and grab man
2413.74 acting and again there's six sort of
2415.48 around them right
2417.04 um well one of the things that can occur
2418.9 is if those those actin are too close
2421.48 together so I imagine my hands
2424.66 um I'm reaching out and doing a giant T
2426.88 right so I'm horizontal out there well
2428.74 if my fingertips are the tips of the
2430.54 myosin and I'm trying to reach up and
2432.04 grab an actin and I want to pull those
2433.9 actins closer to my face well those act
2436.42 and stack on top of each other and
2437.92 that's what actually makes your muscles
2439.3 grow up like if I flex my bicep it
2442.3 actually you know grows up three or four
2443.74 inches
2444.82 because you're stacking these these
2446.56 sarcomeres or what they're called on top
2448.119 of each other all right great well if
2450.579 I'm reaching out to grab them and the
2452.14 muscle is stretched too far I can't
2454.72 actually make that strong of a
2455.859 connection it would be like if I reached
2457.24 out and grabbed something but I can only
2458.5 reach my longest fingertip on it when I
2460.78 go to contract I can't make that strong
2462.28 of a contraction because my grip is weak
2464.02 my grip's gonna break before I reach my
2466.24 strength limit if I'm too close there's
2469.0 nowhere to go I'm already as close so if
2471.82 you actually disrupt that lattice
2473.68 spacing too much you can actually lose a
2475.96 little bit of strength so it's not that
2478.54 getting bigger will ever make you weaker
2480.46 it's simply that you're not optimizing
2482.92 for strength You're simply optimizing
2484.98 for size and so that can that can
2487.359 explain a little bit of the of the
2488.8 disconcurity between growing and
2491.68 performance
2492.94 I'd like to take a brief break and
2494.68 acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens
2496.54 athletic greens is a vitamin mineral
2498.82 probiotic and adaptogen drink designed
2501.46 to help you meet all of your
2502.599 foundational nutritional needs I've been
2504.82 taking athletic greens daily since 2012.
2507.52 so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor
2509.2 of this podcast the reason I started
2511.06 taking athletic greens and the reason I
2512.56 still take athletic greens once or twice
2514.599 a day is that it helps me meet all of my
2516.82 foundational nutritional needs that is
2518.74 it covers my vitamins my minerals and
2520.78 the probiotics are especially important
2522.46 to me athletic greens also contains
2524.26 adaptogens which are critical for
2526.06 recovering from stress from exercise
2527.68 from work or just general life if you'd
2530.14 like to try athletic greens you can go
2531.52 to athleticgreens.com huberman to claim
2534.28 a special offer they'll give you five
2535.66 free travel packs and they'll give you a
2537.28 year's supply of vitamin d3k2 again if
2540.46 you'd like to try athletic greens go to
2541.96 athleticgreens.com huberman to claim the
2544.72 special offer what are a few of the
2546.76 major changes that occur in muscle nerve
2551.14 Etc when
2552.46 we experience hypertrophy
2555.76 I've heard of protein synthesis changes
2559.359 I'm assuming that's true maybe you can
2561.099 tell us a bit more about that
2562.78 changes in blood flow yep
2565.78 perhaps changes in neural innervation
2568.44 who knows maybe even changes in fascia
2571.24 I'm not aware of any specifically but um
2574.3 I have to imagine that they're somehow
2576.22 involved sure so the when we talk about
2579.22 hypertrophy a lot of the adaptations are
2581.319 going to be similar because the the mode
2583.3 of training is close enough so your
2586.3 nerves probably aren't smart enough to
2588.46 differentiate between a set of five reps
2590.26 or a set of eight repetitions they're
2592.18 smart enough to differentiate anything
2593.38 like they know everything that's going
2594.88 on but it's going to be a huge overlap
2597.4 the primary difference with hypertrophy
2599.68 is a couple of things so if you think
2601.9 about the muscle microstructure
2604.359 um I have a whole series of videos on
2606.28 YouTube if you want to see the visuals
2607.48 behind this in fact in there I include
2609.22 the specific diameter size of muscle
2611.02 fibers that I've failed to give you a
2612.819 few minutes ago we will provide an
2614.619 active link to this right so
2617.079 um what happens is this when we talk
2619.3 about and you hear that this classic
2620.8 Buzz phrase of muscle protein synthesis
2623.02 generally what we're talking about there
2624.76 is is contractile units and so when we
2627.52 say contractile units we're talking
2628.72 about the myosin and actin and so what
2630.4 we're really trying to do
2632.14 is say okay there's some amount of
2634.18 protein turnover where we're coming in
2637.0 and we're trying to add more proteins to
2639.16 the equation and so what has to happen
2640.54 there is a series of steps so step
2642.4 number one is there has to be some sort
2643.9 of signal from the external World um
2646.3 this could actually oftentimes it's
2647.68 things like stretching of the cell wall
2650.02 which is what happens with exercise
2651.52 right so you're Contracting a short and
2653.02 you get this big stretch of the cell
2654.28 wall it can come from a simple things
2656.44 like an amino acid infusion this is just
2658.599 eating protein this is why protein
2660.04 ingestion alone is anabolic right it'll
2662.26 help you grow muscle independent of even
2663.76 moving so just eating
2666.22 protein will grow your muscles yeah
2668.68 certainly and those that those data are
2670.599 very clear
2671.98 um of course like anything there's a
2673.54 saturation point
2674.8 in terms of total amount you need to get
2676.599 to and and things like that but yeah if
2679.78 you were to walk into a laboratory
2681.04 fasted overnight and I gave you 30 grams
2683.98 of protein we would see a very
2685.48 measurable increase in protein synthesis
2687.04 quite clearly for several hours probably
2688.96 four to five plus hours um we could
2691.0 maybe bring us to people that would know
2692.38 those data better but many hours with no
2694.9 waitroon correct I am betting that most
2698.44 people are not aware of that fact you
2700.18 know what's actually interesting about
2701.02 it is if you do the exact same study
2703.42 again and you just did strength training
2705.64 you would also see an improvement in
2707.079 protein synthesis right but those
2708.64 factors are independent and the
2709.9 mechanisms are independent such that if
2711.46 you do them both together they stack on
2712.96 top of each other
2714.16 which is really wonderful and if you
2715.839 were to add carbohydrate into that mix
2717.339 now you're actually adding fuel for the
2719.14 entire muscle protein synthesis process
2721.24 and now you're going to see even
2722.68 additive benefits and this is why for so
2724.9 many years uh this is what bore the
2727.54 whole like post exercise anabolic window
2729.22 thing which is like you got to get carbs
2730.96 and protein in post exercise to maximize
2734.319 um mostly perjury now that turned out to
2735.819 be like not totally true in terms of the
2739.18 Windows window to not be as strict as
2741.339 people initially uh asserted as I recall
2744.099 but but still I think that's super
2745.66 interesting these are parallel Pathways
2747.4 for for protein synthesis simply eating
2749.98 protein
2751.3 um or training each independently
2754.26 increases protein synthesis uh I can't
2757.119 help but ask is the same true if one
2759.04 doesn't endurance type exercise if I go
2761.2 out for a 45 minute jog where I can
2764.619 nasal breathe the whole time but if I
2766.119 were to go any faster I would have to
2767.68 kick over into mouth breathing as well
2769.3 so-called Zone 2 ish cardio will I see
2773.02 an increase in protein in synthesis as
2775.72 simply as a consequence of that jog now
2777.94 this is one of the unique factors of
2780.099 strength training you're not going to
2781.3 say that in fact you would it's
2783.04 difficult to measure protein breakdown
2784.359 that's been as extraordinarily
2785.68 challenging to do in the laboratory but
2787.42 you're not going to see those benefits
2788.92 in fact you're going to see quite the
2790.3 opposite it's an entire molecular
2791.8 Cascade
2793.38 so this is kind of how it works so you
2795.819 have to have some sort of signal on the
2797.44 outside and this can be an energetic
2799.839 signal so this could be glucose uptake
2802.3 it could be protein intake it could be a
2804.88 physical stretch what happens is on the
2807.7 cell wall there is some sort of it could
2809.14 be testosterone right testosterone could
2810.76 bind to beta adrenergic receptors and
2813.04 this activates a whole series of
2814.42 Cascades of signaling proteins and these
2816.46 proteins basically play a game of
2817.96 telephone so one tells the next one this
2820.3 is the next one and I sort of walk this
2821.859 entire way well that molecular Cascade
2823.9 is fundamentally the same thing with
2825.94 regardless of the insult but they're
2827.74 different Pathways and so
2829.54 the pathway from strength training or
2831.46 protein ingestion is going to go to the
2833.619 same nucleus it's going to activate a
2835.66 whole set of Gene Cascades that are
2837.28 going to tell you to to go through this
2838.78 entire process of protein synthesis
2840.28 which I'll walk through what that is in
2841.48 a second if you do endurance training
2843.28 it's a different pathway and so instead
2845.079 of activating this entire thing of like
2846.46 mtor and akt and this is anabolic
2848.859 signaling Cascade it's going to do a
2850.9 different one which you can think of
2852.819 more of like as ampk an energy signaling
2856.0 thing so there's a crossover Point here
2858.28 in fact one of the things you'll notice
2859.96 is mtor and akt don't really influence
2862.78 ampk but there is some literature that
2865.9 years ago showed ampk will activate
2867.94 another protein called tsc2 and that
2870.64 will actually inhibit mtor and that was
2872.98 the first molecular explanation for the
2875.2 quote-unquote interference effect of
2877.48 endurance training on hypertrophy could
2879.099 you just take a highlight for people
2880.42 what this is because as you describe
2882.22 these signaling Pathways I just want to
2884.2 um maybe just put a top Contour
2886.48 explanation the mtor pathway is
2888.76 synonymous with cell growth yeah both
2890.619 during development as organisms humans
2893.92 included mature and cells get larger
2897.52 mtor's abundant in the system to put it
2901.24 quite simply and then the ampk pathway
2903.7 and some of the metabolic signaling that
2905.5 you're referring to is more synonymous
2907.24 with cardiovascular exercise in this at
2909.94 least in the context of this discussion
2911.319 and fuel utilization yep and what you
2914.92 described as a crossover point where
2917.5 certain forms of exercise can tap into
2919.42 both of these yep but
2922.06 at least for sake of this conversation
2923.56 we're largely separating them yeah
2926.14 because the the byproduct is the thing
2928.24 that uh that matters here so the result
2930.099 of uh mtor and akt getting into the
2934.3 nucleus is going to be increased in
2935.92 protein synthesis the result of ampk
2938.2 running down to the mind is going to be
2940.3 result in increasing mitochondrial
2941.92 biogenesis so the net outcome is
2944.2 different now
2946.48 I do want to flag it very quickly
2949.24 this is an extraordinarily complicated
2952.06 thing and um in fact in our laboratory
2955.06 we were able to to be one of the first
2956.74 that figured out how to measure all the
2958.839 different subunits of ampk and
2960.579 individual muscles by fiber type so
2962.98 because you're ripping people's muscles
2964.3 out of their knees and their patellar
2966.16 tendons uh so anxious teasing they're
2968.26 they're gently removing with under IRB
2970.96 protocol of course
2972.52 um so even when we say something like
2974.2 ampk it's not one thing Amy we say
2976.599 things like mtor it's not one thing
2977.98 either it is you have the total amount
2979.72 that matters you have the activation the
2981.22 activation sites or many of them so it's
2983.319 not a simple
2985.06 um as what I'm laying it on I just wanna
2987.94 a big concept of kind of what's
2990.52 Happening Here to actually kind of
2992.319 answer your question
2993.64 which is okay so how is the muscle
2996.339 actually growing what you have to
2998.319 understand is is a little bit of how
3000.66 um protein synthesis occurs so what I'm
3002.579 generally meaning is you have a whole
3003.9 bunch of amino acids and this actually
3005.22 goes back to maybe like middle school
3007.02 biology class right so if you take a
3009.119 bunch of amino acids and you combine
3011.099 them together we get these things called
3013.02 a peptide right and if anyone who's ever
3015.359 heard of like peptides that's all it
3017.339 really means you put a bunch of those
3018.78 together you have a poly peptide you put
3021.18 a bunch of those together and we now
3022.5 have a protein so any protein I want to
3025.14 make is going to go through the exact
3027.06 same system the exact same steps it
3030.24 doesn't matter if that protein is going
3031.68 to be a red blood cell it doesn't matter
3033.18 if that's going to be a hair follicle
3034.619 doesn't matter if it's going to be
3035.819 skeletal muscle that's basically protein
3038.339 synthesis so when we tend to think of
3039.839 protein synthesis we we just paint this
3042.18 picture of growing more muscle and
3044.339 that's not the only thing and so when we
3045.9 talk about the benefits of having high
3047.52 quality muscle as being this place
3049.5 that's going to regulate most of your
3051.059 protein synthesis we tend to lose some
3053.339 people because they're thinking oh I
3054.48 don't need to gain muscle
3055.92 and that's not what we're talking about
3057.48 we're talking about regulating the
3058.859 immune system or regular we're talking
3060.3 about regulating any protein turnover so
3062.76 any Protein that's degradated or needs
3064.68 to be broken down in your in your system
3066.54 at all autophagy this is the end like
3068.94 this is such an important buzzword
3071.22 um that's just protein breakdown of an
3073.02 unneeded or damaged protein right that
3076.38 whole thing is going to go through
3077.579 protein synthesis to be able to come
3079.14 back and replace the things the only
3080.88 reason you go through autophagy so you
3082.619 can clean that garbage out and then come
3084.059 back and build in a more properly
3085.8 functioning protein so it's not just
3088.079 about growing more muscle mass it's why
3089.76 you want these systems to be operating
3091.44 well
3092.339 so the protein ingestion is going to
3095.28 just activate that Cascade because it's
3096.72 basically saying oh hey look we have an
3099.48 abundance of Supply here why don't we
3102.059 make something out of it because we
3103.2 don't know the next time this thing is
3104.46 going to be around carbohydrates and fat
3106.68 are very easy to store protein is very
3110.099 challenging it's more transient and so
3112.38 you can store some of it and keep it
3113.819 around but most of it you're going to
3115.319 lose and so when it's available your
3117.359 body wants to act very quickly it
3119.819 doesn't necessarily care if you have
3121.2 extra fat floating around in your system
3122.819 it's all right let's package it up and
3124.38 store it we can easily bring this back
3125.579 out but if you've got protein around
3127.339 you're going to want to use it and so
3129.48 that's why it alone will activate and
3131.339 increase protein synthesis independent
3133.68 of exercise so those effects are
3135.359 additive like I said because that
3136.74 signaling process is independent and
3139.14 once you hit a rate limiting phase then
3141.839 it you are you're there but at its onset
3144.54 those things will work independently
3145.98 okay so that being said what is skeletal
3148.44 muscle hypertrophy in general we think
3151.079 about it as this increase in contractile
3152.819 proteins so those myosin and actin
3154.5 effectively get thicker okay now what
3156.839 happens is since they are thicker and as
3158.94 I talked about a second ago that
3160.68 influences and actually hurts the
3162.54 lattice spacing and so what your body
3164.46 does as a result is say hey let's
3166.5 increase the diameter of the entire cell
3168.78 so that we can maintain our spacing
3170.819 between these things right it's
3172.44 effectively like if you know the two of
3174.059 us were sitting in this room and you
3175.98 doubled in size and I was like well
3177.839 you're in my personal space like and I
3180.119 doubled in size now we're in each
3181.2 other's space the at some point we just
3182.819 have to make the room larger and that's
3184.68 exactly what's happening in the cell and
3186.72 so as you can continue to
3189.3 increased muscle size you're going to
3191.7 get a muscle myofibular accretion you're
3194.52 going to continue to increase muscle
3196.079 fiber size
3197.819 for years there was this other comment
3200.16 about
3201.26 non-functional hypertrophy
3203.64 and this is often called sarcoplasmic
3205.98 hypertrophy now this is not sarcoplasm
3207.9 particular this is a fancy way of saying
3209.64 my muscle is larger but it has no
3211.38 function and the question would be why
3213.42 the hell is that possible if I have more
3215.28 contractile units and I can make more of
3217.559 these cross Bridges perform more of
3219.059 these power strokes this is what these
3220.74 contractions are called how could I
3222.359 possibly be losing function
3224.16 well
3225.599 that was challenged for that was Bro
3227.16 Science for a very very long time in
3229.319 fact what it really came down to was are
3231.359 there different types of hypertory
3232.859 training some that induce contractile
3235.26 protein hypertrophy and some that induce
3237.059 the sarcoplasmic hypertree and that was
3240.24 the significantly challenged until
3241.619 recently
3242.819 Mike Roberts did at Auburn did a series
3245.339 of wonderful studies that showed quite
3246.96 clearly that sarcoposmic hypertrophy is
3249.119 probably happening and in fact there's
3251.64 probably a pretty easy explanation in
3254.22 general what happens is it is it is a
3256.44 increase in fluid
3257.88 in the muscle fiber
3260.099 and so this would allow for the diameter
3262.38 to be larger but since there's no
3263.76 addition of contractile units no more
3265.559 forced production happens and so he
3268.02 actually has a wonderful review paper I
3269.52 believe it's open access where you can
3271.2 go look and he created a wonderful graph
3273.54 um I think that's in my hypertrophy
3275.099 videos on YouTube as well and you can
3276.72 actually see that it's likely happening
3278.94 in phasic changes throughout your
3280.74 training experience so at the beginning
3282.54 of your training but as as the years and
3285.3 year or weeks rather than months and
3287.22 then eventually years go by in your
3288.54 training we have a change in the
3290.28 hypertrophy that's coming from
3291.599 contractile units versus sarcoplastic so
3295.14 I think that is an important note
3296.88 because
3298.26 again people are wondering like how the
3299.88 hell is it even possible for me to get
3301.2 larger muscle and somehow I'm not
3302.579 stronger well if it came from Simply
3304.8 fluid retention and this is not bloating
3306.839 this is not there's no negative really
3309.059 to this it is simply holding a more
3311.7 hydration in the cell diameter gets
3313.68 larger and then everything works that
3315.54 way
3316.38 what you just described calls to mind
3318.059 something similar in the nervous system
3319.619 which is neuroplasticity which of course
3321.54 is the nervous system's ability to
3322.859 change in response to learning and
3324.119 experience and damage for that matter
3325.74 yep and we think about it as one term
3329.46 but there are many different forms of
3331.079 neuroplasticity a discussion that we
3334.559 don't need to get into now but there's
3335.7 Spike timing dependent plasticity and
3337.14 ltp and long-term depression which has
3338.819 nothing to do with psychological
3339.9 depression and on and a pair pulse
3341.88 facilitation and on and on and on in
3343.559 short-term elasticity and so what I'm
3346.26 starting to understand is that there are
3347.94 many paths to what we call strength
3350.28 increase and there are many paths to
3352.38 what we think of as hypertrophy many of
3355.559 these are going to operate in parallel
3357.119 it's going to be rare that any one of
3359.819 them is going to be active alone in
3362.64 order to create hypertrophy or strength
3364.319 changes and that certain forms of
3366.24 exercise and certain ways of doing
3369.18 exercises in terms of sets and
3371.16 repetition schemes and rest intervals
3373.26 between sets and between training
3374.819 sessions are going to tap into different
3377.819 mechanisms but also overlapping sets of
3380.04 mechanisms which is why if I understand
3382.619 correctly you mentioned at the beginning
3384.3 that often not always but often strength
3387.9 increases are associated with some
3389.76 hypertrophy changes and hypertrophy
3393.119 increases are often not always
3394.98 associated with strength increases do I
3396.96 have that right correct and the beauty
3399.0 of this whole thing is while we don't
3401.16 yet know the mechanisms specifically and
3404.22 there's a lot of Confusion And there's a
3405.48 lot of changes that happen there's uh we
3407.76 actually just submitted a paper a few
3409.079 days ago
3410.819 um my stuff uh Jimmy Bagley at San
3412.92 Francisco and Kevin murick at uh one has
3415.14 a wonderful muscle physiology Lab at
3416.64 Arkansas and we we actually this is a
3420.18 very late article actually it's
3421.319 incredibly easy to read
3423.119 um we describe the the role of
3425.22 myonucleation
3426.599 in uh muscle my per tree
3429.42 and there's actually a lot of energy
3430.559 stuff we get into there but
3432.119 um we're learning more and more about it
3433.559 uh as a quick example so
3436.68 skeletal muscle is unique in the fact
3438.72 that it is so large in diameter it's
3440.88 also unique in the fact it's
3441.9 multinucleated what that means is
3444.079 typically in biology you see like a cell
3446.94 has one nucleus that's the place that
3448.559 houses and holds the DNA and it's the
3450.359 control center that was a degro shrink
3451.98 die repair that whole thing well
3453.78 skeletal muscle and human is awesome
3455.16 because it has thousands if not more
3457.38 there's nuclei which gives it that
3460.619 plasticity and so a normal cell has one
3463.559 place it has to go to for any time it
3465.3 wants to upregulate down regulate do
3467.22 whatever the thing is your muscle fibers
3469.44 have these little control centers all
3471.96 throughout them and for years we were
3474.0 like okay great
3475.44 the amount of hypertrophy that you can
3478.14 experience is probably limited by the
3480.72 amount of nuclei you have because you're
3482.579 not going to exceed a certain size of
3484.74 muscle fiber if that's going to mean you
3487.079 lose control and so we're like okay
3489.359 great we found and identified a limiting
3491.64 factor to what will determine how much a
3493.74 muscle can actually grow and then the
3495.599 next question was and then where are
3496.74 these things coming from and this is
3498.599 where satellite cells come in and so it
3500.28 was very clear a satellite cell that's
3501.48 lying dormant sort of on the outside the
3503.22 periphery of the fiber will then go in
3506.4 um into the into the fibroid will turn
3508.619 into a myonuclei and then it can
3510.599 actually you know increase your diameter
3512.52 like that and so then actually it was
3513.66 like hey you're actually limited by the
3516.119 amount of these satellite cells you can
3517.319 get in and turn into nuclear and then
3519.48 the evidence came out that showed hey
3521.22 what if you D train so what if I used to
3523.5 lift weights like a long time ago and I
3525.24 got big but now I've lost a lot of my
3526.68 muscle if I train again you actually get
3529.5 that muscle back faster than it took you
3532.2 the very first time to build it
3534.119 like that's what we call muscle memory
3535.619 like in our film now on your side
3537.78 equation muscle memory is something
3539.22 different rights and nervous when people
3540.9 talk about muscle memory
3542.46 um like the ability to ride a bicycle
3543.9 after so many years of not having tried
3546.18 to ride one that's actually
3548.4 largely independent of the muscle it has
3550.5 something to do with exclusively
3551.64 Independence it's basically a nervous
3553.859 system phenomenon 100 so muscle memory
3555.9 uh has been co-opted by different
3558.059 communities to mean different things
3559.559 yeah so on our side muscle memory is
3562.02 going to mean that ability to remember
3563.78 that muscle size right that hypertrophy
3566.52 because as you explained the motor
3569.099 control thing is that it's a totally a
3570.48 nerve thing that's the one I'll give you
3572.28 this one right you guys the nerve people
3573.599 can have this one well it seems to me
3575.22 that there are a tremendous number of
3576.839 parallels between strength and
3578.76 hypertrophy
3580.319 changes and neuroplasticity this is
3582.66 coming up again and again in this
3583.92 conversation
3585.059 um because we know for instance that if
3587.579 you are exposed to a couple of different
3589.44 languages early on in life you will
3591.359 learn any number of different languages
3593.52 far more easily later in life of course
3595.74 and that's because there's some
3596.52 crossover between different languages
3597.96 especially Latin based languages that
3599.94 allows for that there's a substrate for
3601.859 it it's similar to the the ability to
3603.66 hop on a bicycle again phenomenon or
3605.819 play an instrument phenomenon but it's
3607.98 broader than that and again I think this
3610.859 speaks to the huge number of different
3613.339 adaptive changes that are occurring in
3615.42 the cells and in the nerves that
3616.619 innervate these cells when one
3617.7 experiences increases in strength and
3619.98 hypertrophy so to round that out
3622.68 um and to go back to what I was saying
3624.54 there what we're actually learning now
3626.28 is that nucleation thing
3628.319 and by the way this entire trajectory
3630.18 story is probably over the last like
3631.98 eight years like this is how fast we've
3634.799 changed our understanding of how muscle
3636.78 grows uh the sarcoplasmic reticulum
3638.94 thing five years ago was was Bro Science
3640.98 now it's it's pretty well established
3642.299 the mononucleation thing was eight to
3643.559 ten years ago it's changing every week
3645.54 this paper we just submitted this week
3647.4 showed actually why we had generally
3650.52 thought a few years ago and in fact you
3652.14 can find me on podcasts and probably in
3653.88 some of my videos talking about this and
3655.5 I'm going to tell you right now those
3657.18 things are wrong like we've just had new
3658.74 things come out these last couple years
3660.0 where that D training effect we thought
3662.64 was a reason of well what happens is if
3665.099 you had the muscle before
3666.839 and you've brought in these nuclei and
3669.119 they differentiated and turned into into
3670.859 nuclei
3672.059 and then the muscle got small again you
3674.16 would preserve those nuclei and that's
3676.319 why when you go to train again they were
3678.059 already around so the muscle grows
3679.92 faster the second time they did the
3681.599 first time well now it looks like that's
3683.22 actually not the case in fact it's
3685.38 actually probably hap what's happening
3687.119 is it's a it's a epigenetic change
3690.059 in the nuclei's ability to access the
3693.119 DNA needed to grow muscle it's
3695.22 effectively
3696.48 the analogy we used it's the nuclei are
3700.02 remembering how to ride a bike so it's
3702.359 quite funny that you said that because
3703.559 it's not really necessarily that they're
3705.24 being preserved over time they have
3706.92 learned the sequence it takes to grow
3709.319 the protein there and it goes it happens
3711.42 faster the second time and we've also
3714.78 learned that there are specific nuclei
3716.339 we've known this for actually a while we
3718.02 found this in our lab and we didn't
3719.7 Discover it we just we saw this in our
3721.98 sum of our Harbors but there are
3723.42 different shapes the nuclei some are
3725.579 more oval some are more elongated and
3727.74 the shape determines a lot of the
3729.0 functions some of them are hanging out
3730.26 more towards the periphery and some of
3731.819 them are hanging out right around the
3733.38 nucleus well it looks like there's
3735.18 actually probably different types of
3736.92 nuclei a lot of them that are specific
3739.14 to the mitochondria in fact you can see
3741.18 like on some of the Imaging we have
3742.5 you're just like they're just packed
3743.88 around the the ma the mitochondria and
3747.0 there are some that are probably
3747.96 specific to injury repair
3749.76 and so this is probably explaining a lot
3751.799 of the the individual variation I mean I
3753.48 know you've you've said previously like
3755.46 you're just a very you're very slow at
3757.44 recovery
3758.52 there's a lot of things that go into
3759.839 that and I would I would love to walk
3761.339 through sort of all the buckets uh maybe
3764.099 later into recovery but one of the
3766.859 inherent genetic variations this could
3768.72 be simply that you maybe have more or
3770.52 less of the nuclei responsible for
3772.14 tissue repair
3773.16 um that's something that's been
3773.88 happening in the last like handful of
3775.2 months that's been coming out we'll see
3777.119 if that holds up as true or not
3779.64 um so as we're learning more and more
3781.26 almost every day about muscle physiology
3783.5 what's super fun and interesting and I
3785.819 think the most exciting
3787.74 what to do in order in terms of like how
3790.2 to train and how to eat and how to do
3792.299 everything else to get these adaptations
3793.859 has been pretty well established for a
3796.2 long long time we're just figuring out
3798.54 how like what's happening in the muscle
3800.819 now but we know what to do so from a
3803.76 practical standpoint putting together
3805.68 protocols for any outcome that you want
3809.04 or don't want
3810.839 for any modality you don't have a gym
3814.079 you have uh weights you have dumbbells
3816.96 only you only have kettlebells you don't
3818.94 want to you only use body weight we can
3820.74 you only have three days a week you have
3822.059 seven days a week you wanna maximize
3823.74 muscle growth you want to get a Little
3824.94 Bit Stronger any of these variables you
3827.099 want to throw at me we have a large
3829.319 evidence base for exactly how to get
3831.24 those adaptations and not others so
3832.92 while we have a lot to learn about the
3835.26 mechanisms and the physiology we have
3837.42 pretty good legs to stand on in terms of
3838.619 what to do to get whatever adaptations
3839.819 you want so what are the essential
3841.44 components of an effective strength and
3843.299 hypertrophy protocol okay so what I
3845.76 would like to actually do is is walk you
3847.5 through both of those because as we
3849.299 mentioned before they overlap but the
3852.359 training needs to be differentiated so
3854.579 that you can optimize either strength
3857.48 hypertrophy or if you actually want you
3859.619 can get a combination of both this
3861.0 allows you to then get the adaptation
3862.5 you want avoid ones you don't want and
3865.44 then get it even a combination if that's
3867.24 the preference so a lot of people will
3868.799 talk about I want to get a little
3869.76 stronger I want to add some muscle
3871.619 that's a different answer than someone
3873.119 who wants to truly maximize muscle which
3875.4 is a different answer from somebody who
3876.54 maximizes wants to maximize strength
3878.64 which is a different answer from
3879.78 somebody wants to Max my strength but
3881.819 not actually gain muscle so we have all
3883.38 these combinations what's important to
3885.18 understand before we get into the
3886.5 details
3887.52 there's a couple of things number one
3888.839 we've been teasing this concept so far
3891.48 of the concepts are few but the methods
3894.42 are many and so I want to hit those
3895.799 Concepts right now these are as you as
3898.68 you say these are the non-negotiables
3900.18 that have to happen in any training
3902.4 program and I'm referring to these in
3905.16 the strength and I particular
3906.119 conversation but these are true of power
3907.799 development speed development muscular
3909.66 endurance uh endurance any other thing
3912.119 these are things that just have to
3913.38 happen for any training program to work
3915.18 I mentioned one uh a little bit earlier
3918.48 which was adherence and so that my
3921.48 frequent collaborator Dan Garner will
3923.52 constantly say consistency beats
3925.92 intensity
3927.78 um again in fact the literature will
3929.4 show you very clearly inherence
3931.619 um is the number one predictor of
3933.0 physical fitness outcomes so we want to
3935.7 do something that you will engage in
3937.2 we'll uh you'll put effort into and
3939.0 you'll be able to repeat consistently
3940.319 over time so that's number one
3941.88 the second one is and this is a major
3944.579 reason that people don't hit their
3946.619 fitness goals in fact I would argue
3948.359 outside of not doing it the number one
3950.7 mistake they make is Progressive
3953.4 overload so I'm going to walk you
3955.559 through exactly how much you should be
3957.299 increasing
3958.799 um your sets and Reps and weight Etc per
3961.68 week per month later but that's the
3964.2 biggest thing you have got to have some
3965.76 sort of overload the body works as an
3969.24 adaptation mechanism right so in fact we
3972.059 talked previously about the Harvard
3973.859 fatigue lab and one of the things
3975.72 actually people don't realize is the
3977.28 concept of homeostasis is actually comes
3980.94 from research of the Harvard fatigue lab
3982.619 it was um work that they did on an
3984.24 endurance Runner I forget his name and
3986.88 they sort of realized that after a long
3988.44 period of time working out this is an
3990.78 acute exercise spell the body actually
3992.88 comes back to some stable place despite
3995.039 the fact he was continuing to work and
3996.66 that's exactly what bore the phrase
3998.099 steady state
3999.66 and that actually then they launched off
4001.579 and said wow there's this state that the
4003.14 body wants to be in and we'll call this
4004.72 homeostasis so those all Concepts came
4007.46 out of exercise physiology which is
4009.38 really really cool right um we don't get
4011.0 a lot of love a lot of times
4011.839 scientifically but that's a good one
4013.099 that we took so why that all matters is
4015.98 we have got to achieve some sort of
4017.72 overload without uh going excess so
4021.859 we'll cover that later uh exactly what
4024.619 to do and we'll potentially get into
4026.42 over training and monitoring and
4027.92 mattering things like that but you have
4029.839 to have some sort of consistent
4030.98 predictable overload that's what's going
4032.72 to cause adaptation to continue to cause
4034.22 stress if you don't do that you can
4036.799 still do things like burn calories you
4038.9 can still get some of the other benefits
4040.28 of exercise like improved mood cognitive
4043.039 function
4044.18 etc etc flexibility increases all those
4046.4 can happen without a progressive
4048.14 overload but if you want to see these
4049.819 gains in strength and hypertrophy you
4051.98 really need to progressively overload so
4054.319 that's concept number two
4055.819 the third one here is going to be
4058.7 individualization and this is where we
4060.74 can get into things like personal
4062.48 preference
4063.92 you know equipment availability you have
4065.96 kettlebells or dumbbells you only have
4067.579 bands we have none of that these are all
4070.4 smaller details but that's an important
4072.38 component to it
4074.539 the last one I really want to get into
4076.039 is picking the appropriate Target and we
4079.76 went through this when we talked about
4081.14 the fitness protocol and and if you run
4083.299 through something like that and you run
4084.859 some testing and figure out where your
4086.359 biggest limitations are that's going to
4088.039 help you identify where you need to go
4089.799 so if you can do all those things
4092.839 you're going to be in a good spot to
4095.359 balance specificity
4097.339 and variation
4098.96 all right so if you want to make sure
4100.88 you grow your biceps you better make
4103.52 sure your biceps are working having said
4105.319 that if you over rely on specificity
4108.279 you're going to increase the likelihood
4110.66 of overuse injuries which is going to
4112.219 come back and actually hamper
4113.66 consistency over time
4115.819 all right so this is when hedging
4117.319 towards specificity is important but too
4119.12 much can cause a problem if you go the
4121.1 other direction and you go with too much
4123.199 variation so imagine you're just sort of
4125.299 doing all kinds of different exercises
4126.98 every time you you work out that's
4128.96 actually not enough stimuli directly on
4131.179 the muscle or muscle groups or movement
4132.739 pattern if you're wanting to learn a new
4134.299 movement
4135.56 um to get you very far and so this is a
4137.42 classic problem of I'm doing a lot of
4139.339 work but I don't have a very clear
4140.779 Direction I lack specificity so I'm
4143.54 working but I'm not seeing a lot of
4145.52 improvements and this is like in the
4147.38 business World Etc this is like doing a
4149.179 whole bunch of different things means
4150.199 you get nothing really done so that's
4152.96 the game we're gonna play here right how
4154.52 do we overload this stuff how do we make
4155.96 sure we're balancing specificity and
4157.52 variation how do we make sure I want to
4159.199 do this and then how do I individualize
4160.88 it for my needs and circumstances and
4163.699 and movement restrictions and of time
4166.219 availability and my calendar and desires
4169.279 and all these things so those are the
4171.5 concepts we absolutely have to hit
4173.839 the methods that we choose
4176.359 run across a handful of variables and we
4179.06 call these things modifiable variables
4180.92 because as you modify them or you make
4183.02 different choices within these variables
4184.699 you get different outcomes or
4187.04 adaptations this is exactly what
4188.9 determines the nine adaptations that
4191.6 we've been talking about so the way that
4193.58 I like to say this is
4194.98 exercises do not determine adaptation
4199.1 so you can't simply go I want to get
4201.14 stronger therefore I'm going to choose
4203.6 these exercises
4205.1 that's not how it works what determines
4207.14 adaptation is the execution
4209.96 of the exercises so a deadlift is my
4212.9 favorite example a deadlift is a common
4215.38 example that people think of when they
4217.34 want to choose a lower body strength
4218.84 exercise but a deadlift will not
4220.46 increase your strength unless you're
4221.719 executing it in the proper fashion I'm
4224.3 not even talking about technique here
4225.62 I'm talking about these modifiable
4227.6 variables the same thing for power
4229.76 exercises we'll commonly see mistakes of
4231.86 doing uh activities like a box jump
4234.56 which is great people think oh I'm going
4236.3 to improve my power
4238.1 which we know is extremely highly
4240.08 correlated to activities of daily living
4242.48 and particularly living unassisted as
4245.06 you age right is reduction in power so
4247.699 they'll do an activity like a box jump
4249.02 what they're failing to realize is
4250.28 unless you do it powerfully
4252.38 you won't actually increase power
4254.48 if you don't move fast you won't get
4256.82 faster so the the way that we manipulate
4259.82 these variables is everything to
4262.82 determining the adaptation you get or
4264.92 again don't get so with that Foundation
4268.52 I think we can kind of run right into
4269.96 these things and we can start off with
4271.76 perhaps speed and power and what I would
4274.04 like to do is walk you through
4276.92 all those modifiable variables what to
4280.159 do with them and then hit you with as
4282.26 many different methodologies as we
4284.06 really have time for
4285.62 and then we'll move on to strength and
4287.12 hypertrophy and kind of round the entire
4289.1 thing out and then maybe at the end we
4290.54 can talk some other variables like
4292.88 what happens if I have a training
4294.98 protocol
4296.12 and I'm halfway through and I can't
4297.62 finish my workout what should I do
4299.3 reduce my weight or reduce my duration
4301.94 or things like that so there's lots of
4303.32 what-if scenarios that we can go through
4304.82 that potentially a lot of people
4306.679 listening have questions about so sound
4309.14 like a plan sounds like a plan
4311.36 I'd like to take a brief break to
4313.219 acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker
4315.08 inside tracker is a personalized
4317.0 nutrition platform that analyzes data
4318.86 from your blood and DNA to help you
4320.96 better understand your body and help you
4322.52 reach your health goals I've long been a
4324.8 believer in getting regular blood work
4326.239 done for the simple reason that many of
4328.4 the factors that impact your immediate
4329.96 and long-term health and well-being can
4331.82 only be analyzed from a quality blood
4333.679 test one issue with a lot of blood tests
4335.42 and DNA tests out there however is that
4337.1 you get information back about various
4338.719 levels of lipids and hormones and
4340.28 metabolic factors Etc but you don't know
4342.5 what to do with that information inside
4344.179 tracker makes knowing what to do with
4345.739 all that information exceedingly easy
4347.719 they have a personalized platform that
4350.179 lets you see what your specific numbers
4351.92 are of course but then also what sorts
4354.199 of Behavioral do's and don'ts what sorts
4356.659 of nutritional changes what sorts of
4358.159 supplementation would allow you to bring
4359.96 those levels into the ranges that are
4361.82 optimal for you if you'd like to try
4363.679 inside tracker you can visit
4364.84 insidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off
4368.06 any of inside tracker's plans again
4369.8 that's insidetracker.com huberman to get
4372.86 20 off so just interrupt briefly and
4375.14 make sure that I and everybody else have
4377.719 in mind the proper nine adaptations that
4379.94 we've been referring to and that were
4381.02 discussed in detail in episode one
4384.14 I have listed number one skill and
4386.54 technique number two speed number three
4390.26 power which is speed times Force number
4393.62 four strength number five hypertrophy
4397.52 number six muscular endurance number
4401.06 seven
4401.98 anaerobic capacity number eight maximal
4405.8 aerobic capacity and number nine long
4408.92 duration steady state exercise yep you
4411.62 nailed it thank you for for that it was
4413.239 probably important clarification for
4414.86 everybody
4415.94 um so that being said let's jump right
4417.5 into speed and power now I'll do these a
4420.56 little bit simultaneously they are
4423.44 different if you're a high performance
4425.54 athlete you really need to separate
4427.04 these two things
4428.659 for the most people that we can probably
4430.82 think about them is is the same thing
4432.32 there's not a lot of pure speed training
4434.78 that the general public is is interested
4437.239 in um if you want to actually further
4439.1 break down speed there are multiple
4440.36 components there's acceleration there's
4442.04 top end velocity there's change of
4443.6 direction or agility and things like
4445.64 that so we'll just kind of call All That
4447.739 speed and power for now now at the onset
4450.92 there's this three to five concept that
4452.96 we talked about many times
4455.96 where this is really fairly true for
4458.84 speed power or strength now I I didn't
4462.44 develop the three to five it's just an
4464.48 easy way to help you remember one
4467.0 concept that will run true across all
4469.04 these things so three to five it refers
4471.86 to
4473.0 three to five days per week
4475.219 uh pick three to five exercises and
4478.04 you're gonna do three to five
4479.179 repetitions per set
4480.98 you'll do three to five sets and you'll
4483.92 rest three to five minutes between each
4486.98 set
4488.12 if you do that and you execute any of
4491.659 the exercises that you choose at a high
4494.12 intent and that part is critical you
4497.36 don't get faster by moving kind of fast
4500.42 you can't improve Power by moving like
4503.0 and powerfully you have to be trying
4504.92 regardless of whether actually moving
4506.6 faster or not
4508.239 anytime you're talking about speed or
4510.32 power you're by definition using sub
4512.42 maximal weights so you're going to be
4514.64 able to lift it that's not the question
4515.96 the question is how fast can you lift
4518.96 that Implement and so intention is
4521.06 incredibly important so if you do that
4522.679 the same for strength by the way
4524.9 so if you land on that that allows you
4526.88 to run the gamut from as little as three
4529.219 days a week
4530.36 you're doing a three exercises you're
4532.4 gonna do three sets of three which is a
4534.86 very very low volume it's a a very low
4537.98 amount of days easy to handle all the
4541.159 way to five sets of five of five
4542.9 exercises five days a week so it it's
4545.239 again it's just one sample that's
4548.48 something easy to remember and is quite
4550.76 effective for a very long time and this
4552.62 has been tested quite extensively in in
4555.26 both the coaching Realms as well as the
4557.0 scientific Realms to be quite productive
4559.46 and easy to follow and grasp if you do
4561.86 that all you need to do is slightly
4564.199 increase the load
4565.699 or the volume but mostly the load over
4568.699 time and the number we want to look for
4570.5 there is something like a three to five
4572.48 percent increase
4573.8 per week so an example would be if
4576.679 you're going to do
4578.179 an exercise at 100 pounds you can't
4581.659 necessarily just add five pounds every
4583.219 week that's going to touch you pretty
4584.659 quickly and so you may have to run some
4586.34 a smaller increment if you're doing like
4588.86 a lower body exercise where you might
4590.48 have a couple of hundred pounds on the
4591.679 weight you can probably get away with
4593.3 adding five pounds because it's still a
4594.86 low percentage of the total load so
4596.78 that's roughly uh the guide that we want
4599.719 to get to for speed power and strength
4602.0 so that sounds incredibly simple and
4603.98 effective
4604.94 yet I have a number of questions
4607.64 first off
4609.5 if somebody is using the three to five
4611.719 approach does that mean they should not
4614.179 be doing any other weight training of
4617.06 any kind
4618.44 in those workouts or at all
4620.9 no you can certainly do that in
4623.48 combination with anything else you would
4624.92 like especially if you think about speed
4627.26 and power those are very non-fatiguing
4630.739 and so if you can imagine you're going
4633.26 to go to the beach and you're going to
4635.84 take a 10 pound to 20 pound medicine
4638.36 ball with you and you're going to do you
4640.64 know four different exercises or you're
4642.32 throwing the medicine ball as high as
4643.64 you can in the air four times in a row
4645.739 taking a break and you two or three hits
4647.84 that you do maybe three or four
4649.1 different types of throws that's very
4651.56 good for improving power extremely good
4654.44 but it's not very fatiguing so you could
4656.36 certainly finish that workout in 20
4658.04 minutes and then run on and then do any
4660.679 number of other things so you could do
4662.0 some high intensity and aerobic capacity
4664.4 work you could do steady state stuff you
4666.26 could you could even do hypertrophy on
4668.3 top of that so there's a there's two
4670.76 major categories of what we call
4672.199 periodization there's there's many many
4674.239 of them but the two that have the most
4676.28 scientific literature are what's called
4678.56 linear periodization
4680.06 and another is called undulating or
4682.52 often daily undulating periodization and
4685.04 I'm flagging these two
4686.9 again despite the fact there are many
4688.4 many more because they represent two
4690.5 different concepts which you actually
4691.58 just touched upon so linear
4692.78 periodization is a hallmarked by
4694.64 basically saying we're going to train
4695.84 one adaptation at a time so imagine
4698.36 going say six to eight weeks and you're
4700.76 only doing strength or you're only doing
4702.86 hypertrophy you're endurance for that
4704.36 matter so in that particular case
4707.0 you you would not do anything else in
4709.04 combination
4710.179 if you contrast that to undulating
4712.4 periodization you would actually be
4713.96 doing multiple different styles of
4715.76 training even with either within the
4717.5 same day
4718.699 or just different days so it could be
4720.8 Monday is power Wednesday is strength
4723.44 Friday's hypertrophy whatever or it
4725.9 could be a little bit of strength every
4727.4 single day a little bit I perch for
4728.6 every day a little bit of power every
4729.62 day and you would just change the amount
4731.659 of each that you do within the day to
4734.54 alter the emphasis all right now
4737.96 if you look at the studies and there
4739.34 have been many uh rcts on this
4742.82 the result of both of these training
4744.8 programs is generally basically the same
4746.9 thing they are equally effective
4749.719 here's the major difference though one
4752.239 if your goal is very specific to one
4755.239 outcome you want a hedge toward
4757.28 specificity so if you're like hey I'm
4758.9 trying to maximize the amount of muscle
4761.12 I can build in the next eight weeks then
4763.219 you don't really anything else besides
4765.38 that is just distraction and potential
4767.0 interference
4768.38 does it really matter or not it doesn't
4770.06 matter but it's not helping anything
4771.44 else
4772.34 so linear periodization is is
4774.679 fundamental at providing focus and
4776.42 therefore the the adaptations tend to be
4778.9 oftentimes larger in that specific area
4781.1 that downside is you now go six to eight
4784.28 to ten weeks of doing nothing else and
4786.98 so you were losing those other
4788.48 adaptations that are great at a faster
4790.219 rate and you can imagine doing something
4792.5 like speed work only again speed work by
4795.32 definition is non-fatiguing so when
4798.08 oftentimes we think of speed work it's
4799.46 like oh I did ladder drills and I did
4800.96 all these things and like I threw up at
4802.46 the end
4803.239 that's not speed work you just did a
4805.159 different type of endurance training
4806.3 okay which is great and important so
4807.92 true speed work is very high rest
4810.56 very low fatigue and actually truly
4812.54 trying to reach a new level of speed or
4814.28 velocity
4815.42 so non-fatiguing if you did that
4817.46 exclusively for 10 weeks you would be
4819.98 pretty unfit by the end of it because
4822.08 you did you would also lose a decent
4823.52 amount of muscle mass not because
4824.659 there's an interference effect but
4826.76 simply because the fact you have not
4827.96 stimulated muscle growth for eight to
4829.52 ten weeks and so neither one of these is
4831.86 better than the other we're going to see
4833.719 this classically across all program
4836.36 design or periodization strategies is
4838.88 it's just a it's a give and take there
4840.92 are tons of different systems and and
4842.36 perhaps at the end we can talk about
4843.62 some of the more advanced periodization
4845.12 Styles these ones are are both effective
4848.26 you could do these with beginners you
4850.52 could do these with Advanced athletes
4851.96 you can do them any Spectrum but they're
4853.76 they're some of the more well-documented
4855.679 ones it's just a pro and con game right
4857.96 it's what are you willing to give up
4859.88 the way that you solve that problem is
4862.219 going back to that fitness assessment
4864.14 and your analysis and really truly
4866.78 understanding what your goal is is your
4870.38 goal to do a little bit of strength and
4871.64 a little bit okay great maybe undulated
4873.8 periodization is an approach if your
4875.48 goal is really to maximize strength
4877.88 and maybe you can wait on putting some
4879.56 muscle mass on maybe a linear
4881.0 periodization is a better report or
4883.1 another style of periodization that's
4884.239 optimal for strength gain so it's just
4886.159 simply about addressing your things one
4888.62 of the major problems folks have in
4890.48 addition to lacking Progressive overload
4892.159 is they don't have any foresight past
4894.5 the next day of the training right and
4896.9 so it's really important that you set
4898.4 off blocks that are anywhere between six
4901.82 to 12 weeks long
4903.38 where you're going to have the specific
4904.76 plan ideally you have an idea for the
4907.52 whole year I actually have like a
4909.14 structure I could walk you through for
4910.94 that but even if you don't have that
4912.92 really think about what you want the
4914.42 next 12 weeks and then maybe the next 12
4916.4 weeks after that and that's going to
4917.78 give you a lot of guidance about what to
4919.52 do and what to focus on
4921.739 terrific what about warming up
4924.8 I was taught that one should do higher
4927.92 repetition movements with lighter
4929.6 weights in order to warm up and then one
4931.159 of the things that did make a big
4933.14 positive difference for me in terms of
4934.94 strength and hypertrophy training was to
4937.52 do a moderate repetition warm-up with a
4940.94 fairly lightweight but then to actually
4943.28 keep the number of warm-up repetitions
4945.739 fairly low
4947.0 and work progressively toward the first
4949.42 so-called work set when you say three to
4953.48 five
4954.5 that's three to five work sets correct
4956.54 yep
4957.38 are you also going to tell me three to
4958.76 five warm-ups no are you also going to
4960.86 tell me it has to be done between three
4962.0 and five pm
4964.159 so in terms of five friends in all
4967.219 seriousness uh what does a good warm-up
4969.62 look like yeah and I realize this will
4971.3 vary depending on how cool your training
4973.159 environment is time of day Etc but as a
4976.1 kind of umbrella for a good warm-up okay
4980.42 what should people do
4982.06 the you've already sort of jumped the
4984.26 gun with with my answer it it is
4986.42 honestly very dependent upon the person
4988.04 so some folks respond very well to a
4990.32 minimum work well others I've had lots
4992.179 of actually
4993.199 um professional fighters I've worked
4994.52 with where they'll actually have a major
4996.26 league baseball player right now he's
4997.94 one of the best pitchers in the game
4999.679 probably the best and the longer we warm
5002.86 up the better his numbers get we
5004.659 actually did a vertical jump test with
5005.86 him he's gonna kill me because he got so
5007.96 mad uh I wanted to see how long it sort
5010.36 of took him to reach a peak vertical
5011.679 jump
5012.699 and most times this takes people
5014.679 something like five to ten sort of reps
5017.56 and I said take it up all the way to a
5020.44 maximum vertical jump
5021.82 and then what I want you to do is
5022.84 continue to Jumping until you have three
5024.52 consecutive jumps or you're down lower
5026.38 than 90 percent
5027.82 and so what we're trying to look at is
5029.62 sort of when is he going to break
5030.76 because in baseball he's going to throw
5032.38 like 100 pitchers or so and we're trying
5033.88 to figure out when is his Peak velocity
5035.56 on his fastball gonna drop and sort of
5037.96 basis conditioning on that so it's a
5039.46 different style of conditioning it's
5040.48 power endurance is really what it is
5043.179 um he called me in the middle of it I'm
5044.739 like oh you're done whatever and he's
5045.82 just like no like how many of these am I
5047.199 supposed to do
5048.219 and I was like what are you talking
5049.42 about he's like I'm on rep 130 or
5051.64 something and I was like what
5053.44 and I'm like what rep did you peek on he
5055.0 peeked on rep 70. something like that 69
5057.699 I think technically because he's goofy
5060.52 um so he's a classic example I've worked
5062.679 in for many many years we have a ton of
5064.36 data on him a ton of biological data a
5066.82 ton of um neural muscular stuff like all
5069.04 kinds of stuff and it just the more he
5070.719 warms up an absurd amount of warm-up the
5073.6 better he gets and the better he gets in
5075.46 power production and the better he gets
5076.96 in speed and velocity so his warm-up
5079.179 prior to games is it's totally absurd
5081.46 and just the more volume we throw at him
5083.8 the better he does I have other folks
5086.679 you get past like two or three reps and
5088.54 fatigue starts to set in and now you're
5090.46 actually like reducing power production
5091.78 so there is a ton of variation that goes
5094.719 in that I can give you some guidelines
5096.4 though
5097.719 you need to differentiate if you're
5099.219 training for speed power strength or
5100.719 hypertrophy here's why
5102.94 if we understand a little bit about
5104.56 what's causing the adaptation that's
5106.48 going to tell you what you need to do or
5108.34 avoid for example
5110.38 volume is the primary driver in
5112.9 hypertrophy
5115.36 intensity is the primary driver in speed
5117.82 power and strength
5119.32 all right which what that means is you
5121.48 need to preserve intensity for the first
5123.1 three you need to preserve volume in the
5124.84 second one at most so if your warm-up is
5127.0 so extensive in the hypertrophy training
5129.76 that it compromises your training volume
5131.44 because of fatigue even if it
5133.0 compromises the last set of the last
5135.219 exercise then you're actually probably
5137.02 walking yourself backwards by doing that
5139.179 extensive you would have been better off
5140.62 starting your first working set slightly
5142.96 sub-optimal
5144.28 right because it's not really you're
5145.659 just trying to accrue volume at that
5148.06 point
5149.02 strength Empower is the opposite
5151.36 until you're moving very very fast or
5154.179 powerfully you're not really causing the
5156.34 adaptation so there's no point of
5158.08 starting your working set until you're
5159.46 really basically at a hundred percent so
5161.8 the warm-up should be as long as it
5163.42 takes you to get to where your Mobility
5165.4 is in the right spot like your joints
5167.32 feel good you feel fresh you feel
5169.179 activated and you really feel Peak power
5171.34 anything before that is a warm-up set in
5174.52 the sport of Olympic weightlifting a lot
5177.1 of times the coaches will measure
5178.78 barbell velocity Travis Mash has done a
5181.12 fantastic job with this he's got a lot
5182.86 of data on what's called velocity-based
5184.48 training I'm Brian Mann at Missouri and
5186.639 Miami tons of work here and generally
5189.34 those communities are not going to count
5191.8 any repetition as a working set until
5194.199 you exceed 70 of your one rep max
5197.62 where that's changed because of a lot of
5200.02 people doing the velocity-based stuff is
5201.46 now they're basing that simply on an
5202.96 achieved velocity
5204.52 and so really the warm-up is irrelevant
5206.679 they don't even it's sort of just like
5208.0 do whatever you want and we're going to
5209.08 measure the barbell until you actually
5210.28 hit an outcome and now you're at what a
5212.199 working set
5213.34 um so different ways to think about it
5215.98 um depending on what you're training for
5217.3 that'll give you a little bit of a
5218.62 guideline if you're training for
5220.78 anything past hypertrophy then really
5223.12 and especially even hypertrophy it just
5224.739 comes down to
5225.94 are you feeling
5228.159 um ready to work are you cold are you
5231.04 moving to the correct positions and if
5232.84 all those things are fine I don't care
5234.699 if you start a little bit early and save
5236.08 some gas then especially if you're a
5238.12 person like you who may be a bit more
5239.699 inclined to fatigue quickly relative to
5243.58 Trevor who's just has no response to
5246.04 fatigue whatsoever
5247.36 is it useful to do more warm-up at the
5250.6 beginning of a workout say before the
5252.88 first exercise and then once one has
5255.88 achieved both local and systemic warm-up
5259.0 in air quotes
5260.62 um then perhaps on the second or third
5263.5 exercise fourth exercise Etc
5267.46 one or maybe even zero warm-ups yeah
5270.58 fair point we generally think about
5272.44 warm-ups in a couple of ways this is a
5274.179 really actually this is a very clever
5275.92 question
5276.88 you want to have some sort of General
5278.38 Global warm-up scheme we tend to prefer
5282.46 Dynamic warm-ups so this is whole body
5285.159 movements rather than like sitting and
5286.84 stretching static stretching things like
5288.94 that so something that involves momentum
5290.98 yeah momentum or movement right so this
5293.44 is like
5294.34 uh
5295.659 think about this in like old gym class
5297.639 it's like your high knees and your butt
5299.92 kickers and just different things like
5301.12 that where you're moving in different
5302.199 planes you're moving joints through tons
5304.6 of range of motion you're getting a lot
5306.219 of movement there so you're getting the
5308.02 local warm-up you're also getting the
5310.0 the total systemic activation everything
5312.46 else is going on there so that is what
5314.32 we consider to be a general warm-up five
5316.42 minutes
5317.26 is a very sufficient number perhaps 10
5319.9 if you're a slow goer achy and some
5322.78 things like that and you really got to
5323.98 get the ankle warmed up if you're doing
5325.96 lower body stuff really make sure that
5327.52 that's moving correctly the hips and
5329.5 knees will follow
5330.82 um upper body stuff really get the
5332.679 shoulder blades and the neck like making
5334.78 sure you're going there and the elbows
5336.639 will follow after that
5338.26 um so five to seven minutes of a general
5340.3 warm-up a lot of times like classic
5342.28 exercise science it will even just put
5344.139 you on a bike cycling for five minutes I
5346.54 don't like that personally Dynamic
5348.699 movement is more preferred if you really
5349.96 just move for five to seven minutes
5351.04 you'll be fine there now specificity
5353.139 within each movement it's very important
5355.719 that your first exercise of the day is
5358.179 generally the thing you've prioritize
5359.86 that's oftentimes the most important
5362.44 you're going to do it often times is
5365.139 also the most complex and the most
5367.96 moving parts so it tends to be
5370.12 multi-joint it tends therefore you need
5372.82 to have movement precision and skill
5375.219 diode right you don't typically start
5376.9 your workouts off with the forearm curl
5379.36 all right like this you don't need a
5381.58 tremendous amount of warm-up to get
5382.719 going on that you're going to start off
5384.4 with medicine ball throws or a snatch or
5387.159 some agility work you you need to have
5388.78 the whole system going because multiple
5390.34 joints are moving position matters
5391.96 technique there's just a lot of skill
5393.34 requirement
5394.54 Etc
5395.5 so the individualized workout
5398.679 um or the specific workout for the
5400.3 specific movement for that very first
5402.159 one
5403.0 my general rule of thumb is like
5404.5 whatever it takes
5406.0 to move perfect in that first exercise
5408.699 past that you don't necessarily need to
5411.52 do individualized warm-ups for your next
5413.199 movements unless it is a movement you're
5415.48 trying to learn or just even get a
5417.4 little bit better at
5418.54 like drop the load a little bit work on
5420.88 some accruing some practice reps
5422.8 fantastic or it's another dissimilar
5426.46 complex movement so let's say your first
5428.32 exercise was
5430.0 a front squat and you got loaded for
5432.219 that and now you're going to move into a
5433.36 pull-up but your mechanics aren't the
5434.8 best there and so you really need to
5435.94 change and do some maybe more specific
5438.48 activation warm-ups for that or
5440.62 something else or it's running or
5442.06 something totally different so yeah you
5443.98 don't need to re-warm up for every
5445.54 single exercise as you go generally once
5447.88 you're good to go the same muscles that
5450.4 you're going to use in the next exercise
5451.54 are warm same joints
5453.699 then you're good to go
5455.56 you talked about intent
5457.659 within the movement
5459.34 what about specific cadences for
5462.9 repetitions yeah I was taught that one
5466.9 should lower the weight slowly the
5468.88 so-called eccentric portion of the
5470.44 movement and then to try and
5473.94 explode the weight through the
5476.5 concentric phase and then also make sure
5480.46 that one is using full range of motion
5482.5 and perfect form yeah as it were now of
5486.76 course that is one tiny slice of the
5489.88 possible
5491.139 rep cadences and ways to approach
5493.9 resistance training although I think
5496.36 it's a pretty good one yeah what are the
5499.659 general parameter sets that one needs to
5501.639 consider you could imagine lifting you
5503.98 know four seconds concentric pause for
5505.84 one pause for two
5507.52 eccentric I realize there's an infinite
5509.5 number of variations here yeah but is
5512.08 there a way to use rep Cadence
5513.82 repetition Cadence that is as a way to
5517.0 work through weak points
5519.04 um and to be strong in every position of
5521.32 the movement yeah a lovely question I
5523.84 think the
5524.98 the way I would like to answer this
5527.139 is
5528.82 maybe going back just a touch to get
5531.219 directly to that so I think if we walk
5533.26 through Power strength and hypertrophy
5535.78 and I hit you with the concepts that are
5538.36 specific to each one
5539.98 that's going to lay out your answer
5541.6 because the most true answer there is it
5544.179 depends on the goal the answer for what
5547.42 is optimal for strength is diametrically
5549.82 opposed for potentially what's optimized
5551.46 hypertrophy the same exact thing can be
5554.08 said for momentum so we've classically
5556.0 heard things like this you know don't
5558.1 bounce at the bottom you're cheating
5560.739 right so if you're doing a lap pull down
5562.84 or something you know you don't you
5564.699 don't bounce and rebound you don't you
5567.52 stop at the bottom slow down all these
5569.739 things are thought to be truisms of
5572.44 strength conditioning but guess what
5573.76 those are all truisms assuming
5576.4 or trying to grow muscle
5578.44 and that's that actually goes back to
5580.12 our conversation and and episode one
5582.159 about a lot of the things we think are
5584.32 just fundamental truths about strength
5586.12 training are just fundamental truths
5587.679 that came from the bodybuilding world
5589.42 and they're not wrong they're good ideas
5590.86 but they're all their adaptations one
5593.5 needs to get from strength training that
5595.9 are not just maximizing muscle growth so
5598.239 what I will lay out to you is a case for
5599.98 which you should bounce
5602.26 a case for when you should go fast a
5604.48 case for when you should be under
5605.62 control all these things are are
5608.38 different variables we can modify and
5611.02 get different adaptations for it is
5612.639 there a way that you could lay out for
5613.84 us
5614.92 optimal repetition cadences for
5619.719 strength specifically versus hypertrophy
5622.659 specifically just to sort of bookend the
5624.94 conversation and then migrate toward the
5626.679 middle in terms of rep cadences that
5629.199 would satisfy the desire to have a bit
5631.42 of both we can get pretty close
5633.219 yeah so when you're talking about
5635.8 strength versus hypertrophy remember
5637.96 strength is a movement
5640.12 hypertrophy is muscle size
5642.4 that's that's the the key to your answer
5644.56 here so when you're trying to get
5646.36 stronger what you're effectively trying
5647.92 to do is get better at producing a
5650.26 certain amount of Force 3 movement okay
5651.94 now Force
5653.8 is mass times acceleration
5656.199 so what's the mass in the bar multiplied
5658.3 by how well I can accelerate it
5660.88 intentionally going slower
5663.88 is only reducing acceleration
5667.12 right so it's hard to argue that going
5671.08 slower
5672.4 is going to improve strength because
5674.86 you're simply reducing acceleration
5677.02 so you need to practice
5679.78 lifting heavier at a faster rate now
5683.219 does that mean if you're trying to get
5685.36 stronger there are no phases of your
5687.58 training in which you'll slow down or
5689.08 plus no of course not there are certain
5691.3 rules in different organizations where
5693.34 you have to pause the bottom like
5695.56 there's all kinds of little things like
5697.179 there but in general we want to think
5698.98 about what are we trying to do here
5700.42 we're trying to get better at moving a
5702.94 heavier Mass
5704.32 at a faster rate of acceleration that is
5706.659 more force that is more strength
5709.139 hypertrophy is not that
5711.4 the goal here is not a functional
5713.5 outcome it is what is needed to cause
5715.54 the most amount of hypertrophy
5717.94 and when you get to ipertory then your
5719.92 optimal Cadence
5721.42 is up to you
5722.98 you can do any combination in fact you
5725.08 could do it the same exact Cadence that
5727.78 you did your strength training with and
5729.219 get the same adaptations as a poetry if
5732.219 you modify the other variables
5733.659 appropriately or you could go slower or
5737.44 you could do pauses or you could do a
5740.199 thing that is called triphasic training
5742.6 where you spend the first phase several
5744.34 weeks of your training where you do
5745.659 eccentrics only so you're just lowering
5748.06 the bar and you're basically stopping
5749.679 you can then do the next phase of your
5751.6 training which is isometrics you're just
5753.4 holding at that bottom position and then
5755.199 the next phase you're training you're
5756.28 focusing on the concentric portion of it
5758.44 right triphasic one two three eccentric
5760.06 isometric concentric so that's a
5762.58 fantastic way of developing actually
5764.199 strength a little bit of hypertrophy but
5766.78 you're manipulating the variables in
5768.639 terms of how you execute the repetition
5770.26 range you can actually induce a lot of
5772.84 hypertrophy moving the weight fast as
5775.719 you mentioned even down slow under
5776.98 control now
5778.239 one thing one will never Advocate is
5780.94 moving any sort of weight or load
5782.739 uncontrolled the Assumption here when
5784.9 I'm saying go fast is you're always in
5786.4 control I never want you bouncing and
5788.38 crushing your sternum with the barbell
5790.42 Off Your Dust but you you can move at a
5792.76 lot of rates you can um the isometric I
5794.98 mentioned because this is when things
5796.179 like body weight training come into play
5798.219 absolutely you can gain strength and
5800.38 even a little bit of hypertrophy
5801.78 especially in the upper body doing
5803.98 isometrics is much harder to do this but
5806.86 the lower body
5808.06 um you just you just you outrun that
5809.32 coverage really quickly you need load
5811.3 but there's a lot of ways this is also
5813.219 probably why people have done things
5814.54 like
5815.56 gone to yoga only or Pilates or some of
5818.56 these things that are body weight based
5819.88 and there's no external load and they've
5821.139 actually increased muscle size so I'm
5823.6 getting the picture there are a ton of
5825.46 options in terms of rep cadences
5827.679 however
5829.6 can we say that one should pick a given
5832.42 rep Cadence within an exercise rather
5835.36 than changing it from set to set within
5836.92 an exercise or that one should perhaps
5839.139 even pick a certain rep Cadence for an
5840.88 entire workout I'm suspecting that your
5843.52 answer is going to be it depends yeah it
5845.679 is but if you know I'm not going to use
5847.6 the if you had a gun to your head kind
5849.219 of situation but if you had a gun to
5851.199 your head what would be the rep Cadence
5853.96 that you would prescribe yeah
5856.56 for strictly strength or as much
5859.239 strength with as little hypertrophy as
5860.92 possible and in picking that rep Cadence
5863.159 then it therefore has to thread
5865.84 throughout the entire exercise bout so
5868.659 you're actually right you can because of
5870.34 that undulating periodization stuff I
5871.719 talked about you can actually do this in
5873.46 a lot of ways so you could do one
5875.32 exercise at the beginning where you have
5877.6 a set Cadence say a three one one it is
5880.96 like a very one so that's con so that's
5882.88 Lifting for three pause for one lower
5885.52 for one uh be generally the opposite
5887.86 okay so the first number is always The
5889.3 Eccentric generally okay so depending on
5891.58 exercise lowering the the weight for a
5894.46 count of three yeah pause for one yeah
5896.679 it totally depends on the exercise like
5898.12 a deadlift starts concentric and
5899.679 finishes eccentric but a bench press
5901.06 starts yeah okay so it's start to finish
5902.62 start to finish is the better way to
5904.06 think about it yeah so in
5906.159 I'll clarify actually
5908.08 when we say 3-1-1 we're generally
5909.82 talking about almost always The
5911.62 Eccentric is the slower portion
5913.6 regardless if it's the first or the last
5915.219 right so whether you're doing a bench
5917.139 press or The Eccentric is lowering the
5919.659 bar to your chest that's the first part
5921.52 of the movement one two three pause one
5924.719 one up which means accelerate as hard as
5928.06 you can the way up that's what you
5929.56 describe right as opposed to say a row a
5931.96 row which is actually going to be
5933.159 starting off concentric
5935.199 so you're going to be pulling that thing
5936.46 to your chest as fast as you can under
5937.96 control not slamming off your chest
5939.34 holding for one second and then taking
5940.78 three seconds to lower it back on the
5942.94 rack or on the ground or whatever so the
5945.88 reason we do that is somewhat intuitive
5947.56 but it is again to make sure you're not
5949.36 advancing a bar or an Implement onto
5951.88 your physical body at an extremely fast
5953.62 rate that that's very difficult to deal
5956.08 with so a three one one is a very
5958.179 standard
5959.92 um strength protocol that is something
5961.719 you can just run with if that's all you
5963.699 ever wanted to do it'd be absolutely
5965.139 fine lower the bar for a count of three
5967.36 it actually ends up being approximately
5969.159 three hardly anybody is counting off
5971.5 seconds precisely I mean it's I suppose
5973.78 it's doable but then pausing briefly yep
5977.02 and that brief is almost uh that pause
5979.48 is almost
5981.46 um unmeasurable it is simply are you
5984.219 under control before you transition from
5986.32 the center to concentricular
5987.82 concentration it's just a safety thing
5989.739 so once you feel down you've reached
5991.12 complete range of motion you're ready to
5992.38 transition then just go you don't really
5993.699 need to go like 1000 Watts and then go
5995.92 up it's just making sure again we don't
5997.42 slam weights off of body parts and that
6000.06 final one in the three one one the
6003.659 execution of the usually concentric
6005.76 portion of of the exercise yep as fast
6008.219 as you possibly can okay so that would
6009.719 be for
6012.06 the majority of the outcome being
6014.52 strength yep okay and of course we
6017.4 should acknowledge again there are a ton
6020.04 of variations that one could Implement
6021.78 there but that that would be a good
6023.639 starting place on the opposite side for
6025.679 somebody who's mainly interested in
6027.0 hypertrophy yeah what would be the rep
6029.28 Cadence that
6031.02 um if you had a gun to your head that
6033.179 you would prescribe I would probably do
6034.8 the exact same thing but I would like I
6036.48 would make the last number two
6038.88 so three one two
6042.6 you could also just keep three one on it
6045.06 is still very fine even exploding on the
6048.0 contrast is still highly effective for
6050.46 training hypertrophy so if you want to
6051.96 keep it super simple and just make rep
6053.52 Cadence not a variable that you play
6055.679 with because you have other ones to move
6057.12 that's great if you want to add a little
6058.98 bit of time to the concentric phase fine
6062.1 it's not going to do it's not going to
6064.739 make enough of a difference for most
6066.96 people for you to really worry about
6069.239 I guess that's sort of the point I
6071.58 really want to make this is we're
6073.199 classically this is a classic example of
6074.639 we're deep into a method
6076.199 right if as long as you get the concepts
6078.48 I talked about earlier whether you want
6079.86 to do three one one three two three
6081.3 three three three try phase this is just
6084.239 a method choice that doesn't mean
6085.62 they're irrelevant they are there are
6087.659 subtle changes within them it's just 80
6089.699 20 rule right so 80 of the benefit is
6092.28 going to be from the concept 20 is this
6094.139 small thing if you're super into this
6096.06 field or you actually want to work with
6098.1 a qualified uh certified coach or
6100.56 something they there's lots of reasons
6102.42 to play with this if you're just on your
6103.86 own here and running this thing
6105.659 311 is fine 312 totally fine anything
6108.96 like that you really just want to make
6111.78 sure that in the strength side of the
6114.3 equation
6115.26 you're under control and you can add
6117.36 enough load to stimulate strength and
6120.719 not get hurt with an acute trauma right
6122.88 on the hypertrophy side you're just
6125.04 wanting to load enough to where you can
6126.36 hit volume
6127.38 because you got to put a lot on there so
6129.0 if you want to go lighter if you want to
6130.679 go slower fine you if you go slower in
6133.56 your repetition so maybe even like a
6135.36 five SEC second eccentric a two second
6138.239 pause a three second Rise that's great
6141.36 you can actually then stimulate the same
6143.219 amount of hypertrophy and either do it
6145.32 with less weight
6146.699 or do it with less repetitions so it's a
6149.28 variable you can play with if you're
6150.54 like hey
6151.98 I don't have
6153.78 enough weights at my house or I only
6155.58 have a kettlebell or a dumbbell
6157.619 how am I going to stimulate hypertrophy
6159.36 your only option is really doing more
6161.28 reps well eventually that that train
6163.08 runs pretty shallow okay here's the
6165.84 thing you can play with maybe just add
6167.52 time under tension that's what we're
6169.139 calling right just you know do slower
6171.48 repetitions go longer ones and hold it
6173.28 so it's a variable that we use to
6175.26 individualize programs rather than
6176.76 something that you should really be
6177.84 focused on as like a core aspect that's
6179.94 going to be driving whether or not your
6181.26 program works it's just a tool we can
6183.239 play with in the what-if scenarios
6185.639 um I will use this stuff a lot when I'm
6187.86 traveling you can do a tremendous
6189.78 workout in your hotel room just doing
6191.88 like a 10 second eccentric a 10 second
6194.1 hold a 10 Centric concentric yeah I've
6197.1 had some decent hotel room workouts
6199.199 they're not my preference but
6201.3 um by simply doing things like
6203.699 um 10 second lowering uh handstand push
6207.96 up against the door totally
6209.88 um obviously assisted for me I don't I
6212.28 can't do a free handstand push-up yeah
6214.32 um I just don't have the skill or the
6216.36 strength or both
6217.56 um you can do some sort of configured
6219.36 dips between the beds or chairs and this
6222.119 kind of thing
6223.199 um squats are great to do in hotels put
6225.84 your back foot up on a on a bed and get
6228.06 a an amazing split squat workout done
6229.98 yeah a lot glute Bridges lots of stuff
6231.48 you can do that yeah with a jump rope if
6233.04 you've ever heard someone jumping in the
6234.78 in the morning yeah
6237.239 um it may or may not have been me it
6238.5 could be any number of things but I am
6239.88 known to skip rope in uh in hotel rooms
6243.119 um not to get overly detailed but I
6245.58 think there are going to be a number of
6246.96 people wondering about
6249.119 how to breathe during repetitions
6252.9 and how to breathe in between sets so
6255.48 I'd like to just briefly touch on this
6256.86 and this is something that I know we're
6258.119 going to return to again when we have
6259.739 our discussion about recovery but is
6262.8 there a general rule of thumb for how to
6266.04 breathe during repetitions during work
6268.44 yep for strength maybe even strength
6271.5 versus hypertrophy in in a way that
6274.26 maximizes oxygen input to the system you
6277.08 know keeps you uh alert and conscious
6280.08 but that also protects the body by
6283.02 creating some rigidity in the system
6284.58 right because certainly being def with
6287.159 all your exhale the body is a very
6289.619 different beast in terms of stability
6291.54 than with the body full of air versus
6293.58 you know breathing during the repetition
6295.32 movement there's a maneuver that is long
6298.38 been uh labeled the valsalva techniques
6302.219 so what that really means is you're
6304.08 trying to use air to create
6305.28 intra-abdominal pressure and what you're
6307.5 really trying to do is create a cylinder
6309.719 around your spine the real issue you
6312.48 have to to play here is regulation of
6314.76 blood pressure and spinal stability now
6317.639 you should be able to breathe and Brace
6319.739 what I mean by that is you should be
6321.36 able to create total intra-abdominal
6323.1 pressure regulate uh spine control while
6325.92 breathing it's just very hard for a lot
6328.08 of people to do it's a skill you should
6329.46 absolutely work on you can actually you
6332.04 can do this and you can go around like I
6333.36 do this trick in class and students can
6335.159 come and they can push any part
6337.5 um of my entire abdomen it's super tight
6339.719 and I can talk now it's going to be a
6341.159 little bit labored you can hear a little
6342.36 bit of a difference but you should be
6343.38 able to do that if you have to like
6345.239 hunch down and you can't even muster
6347.34 your breath and it takes that to create
6349.679 pressure you're not actually you don't
6352.679 really understand the abdominal control
6354.06 necessary to create that stability so
6357.179 step number one is that's the goal now
6359.58 with the blood pressure thing we have to
6360.96 be careful because a standard blood
6362.76 pressure ideally if we sat around right
6365.1 now
6365.88 it was probably something like 120 over
6367.92 80. systolic versus diastolic that's a
6370.44 normal number right high blood pressure
6372.06 is something over that well
6374.28 with an acute bout of exercise you can
6376.199 see that number reach as high as like
6377.58 450 over 350. which effectively means
6380.219 you have total blood occlusion right
6381.9 your blood pressure is so high blood is
6383.219 not moving anywhere and it's in the
6384.48 middle of a very heavy set especially
6386.04 complex movements especially when
6387.9 they're loaded on your body this could
6390.06 be an overhead press or squat variations
6392.94 anything like that blood pressure is
6394.86 going to be a problem and the reason why
6396.0 that matters is that's what's going to
6397.02 make you pass out it's not the fact that
6398.94 you ran out of oxygen in three seconds
6400.5 it's the fact that blood pressure got so
6402.36 high you blocked out and so we want to
6404.58 have we're gonna have to play this game
6405.659 of releasing a little bit of the
6406.86 pressure so we can actually get blood to
6408.659 move a little bit making sure that
6411.179 we don't lose spinal stability so we can
6414.239 finish our workout that's really the
6415.44 question you asked right how do I play
6417.0 this game of oh I have several hundred
6419.219 pounds on my back or my chest and I
6421.32 don't want to Exhale
6423.179 right so I don't lose spinal stability
6424.86 but at the same time I don't want to
6426.239 pass out right which is which is a
6428.1 problem so a kind of a couple of rules
6429.9 of thumb if you're going to be doing
6431.58 something in which you can complete the
6433.32 entire exercise without a breath
6435.96 and it is of a maximal or close to load
6438.119 that's probably your best strategy so in
6440.04 that particular case you'll see a lot of
6441.36 breathing techniques where you're going
6443.34 to take a very large inhale
6445.02 ideally this is done through the abdomen
6447.36 not the shoulders so we shouldn't seeing
6449.219 clavicles Rising during this thing
6451.32 you'll see a common mistake of of the
6453.119 bars on their back and you see people do
6454.44 this like big inhale thing and all they
6456.42 do is Elevate their collabos that's not
6458.639 necessarily going to increase pressure
6460.139 through the abdomens which is what
6461.46 you're looking for so you want to be
6462.48 thinking about belly moving out in all
6464.76 four areas in front of you to your left
6466.739 and right and to your back that's that
6468.96 quadrant sort of idea of stabilizing
6471.239 your spine you can do that independent
6473.4 of your clavicles moving like your
6475.38 shoulders don't need to rise for that
6476.88 you don't really need the oxygen for
6479.0 metabolic purposes you're just using the
6481.86 air for a brace that's really all you're
6484.56 after so you're trying to visualize your
6487.08 torso is more or less a cylinder yep and
6489.78 you're trying to fill it with air
6491.88 the logic being that if I were to push
6493.619 down onto a say a full unopened can of
6496.739 soda yep water
6499.02 for all your sugar phobes out there soda
6501.36 water
6502.26 uh and then
6504.6 push as hard as I could it's going to be
6506.219 hard for me to crush that can but if the
6508.38 can were empty or if it were a little
6510.06 bit kinked in the middle correct then I
6512.28 could likely Crush that can yeah what
6514.199 you're really doing is you have your
6515.58 spinal Erectors in the back right and
6517.38 then a whole series of abdominal
6518.699 exercises and you actually have some
6520.26 neural control systematic control of
6522.619 Contracting those but the you don't have
6525.6 muscles on the inside
6527.28 that you can do so you're basically
6528.78 bringing in air and saying I'll use air
6530.28 to push from the inside out and I'll use
6532.26 muscles to push from the outside in to
6534.3 create this brace and I don't want over
6535.98 compression with the muscles this is a
6538.38 like if you if you see people that have
6539.88 just enormous spinal Erectors
6542.28 sometimes that's an indicator of
6544.32 actually a poor breathing or bracing
6546.179 strategy because they're using spinal
6548.88 rectors to create all their compression
6550.199 and not actually using the inside enough
6552.06 that's not always the case but sort of
6554.1 like a thing to think about so over
6555.54 compression through the spinal rectus is
6557.94 not necessarily ideal if you wanted the
6561.0 best scenario is a little bit of a brace
6562.679 of both so we use some air to push this
6564.48 side we use some musculature depressed
6566.4 that way and then that that spine is
6568.139 just nicely
6569.639 held in position again not in a position
6572.58 where I've locked down my diaphragm and
6574.26 I can't get any air out I should be able
6576.239 to get that brace pattern and then be
6578.82 able to speak in fact like I'm doing it
6579.96 right now and you'll see like a little
6581.219 bit of if you're really paying attention
6582.719 to my voice you can hear a little bit of
6584.34 a subtle difference but I should be able
6586.08 to do this for quite a long time
6587.58 right like I I could take a maximum rep
6589.44 right here in this position whether I'm
6591.42 overhead pressing doing some sort of row
6593.639 like anything and feel very braced in in
6596.699 the entire quadrant
6598.5 this is very helpful I I'm going to work
6601.56 on it but can we say that a an effective
6604.44 way to start off in terms of breathing
6607.38 during repetitions would be to take a
6609.78 gulp of air during the lowering phase
6612.48 The Eccentric phase and then to Exhale
6614.699 during the yeah concentric exertion
6617.1 phase I asked that because that's what
6619.02 I've been doing for a while and it makes
6621.0 me feel safe I don't know if I am and it
6623.76 allows me to Exhale as I exert the the
6627.199 hardest portion of the exercise yeah and
6630.719 perhaps I also borrowed that from
6632.52 martial arts where one tends most often
6635.1 is trained to Exhale on the on the
6637.5 strike yeah if you're going to be doing
6639.36 again the number of repetitions can be
6641.34 completed without a breath
6642.96 a lot of times you're better off saving
6645.119 that exhalation until you complete
6647.219 wow but you don't have to but for a
6649.139 reasonably heavy set of hack squats or
6651.239 even leg extensions and given that I
6652.98 already can't leg extension my body
6655.619 weight maybe it's established oh maybe
6657.659 this is why
6658.92 um the idea of holding my breath for an
6661.38 entire compound set so again I'm kind of
6665.04 listening to mine
6666.3 um you know like where is my insurance
6668.159 card who's going to drive me to the
6670.02 hospital this kind of thing
6672.42 um in all seriousness what if I want to
6674.88 breathe during the set yeah so
6677.159 I I'll clarify I'm generally meaning if
6680.219 you're doing like a one rep max
6681.96 or something like that okay well they
6683.76 certainly could hold my breath for a one
6685.02 repetition maximum that you know maybe
6687.0 like a double or something like that
6688.56 depending on what you're doing like
6690.0 maybe a triple a bench press you can
6692.159 probably do three
6693.42 and get away with it a squat it gets
6694.86 harder deadlift so it kind of depends on
6696.54 the exercise
6697.44 um you want to take that breath though
6699.179 prior to The Eccentric portion
6701.58 not during so lower breathe in lock or
6705.6 set and now start our movement pattern
6707.82 wherever it's going to be exhaling on
6710.159 the concentrate portion during it is
6711.78 fine it's no problem
6713.76 um especially if you're not extremely
6715.619 heavy and what's your what are your
6717.78 thoughts on grunting and screaming yeah
6719.46 fine I don't care I don't tend to do
6721.32 that I'm occasionally known to squeal or
6723.119 whimper
6724.94 I think of you and I think squeal
6728.28 whimper absolutely thanks
6730.32 um if you're going to be doing multiple
6731.699 repetitions
6732.84 uh what we actually do for the NFL
6734.4 combine
6735.42 is we teach them a very specific Excel
6737.159 strategy so there's one test that they
6738.48 do uh which is they bench press 225
6740.46 pounds for as many reps as possible a
6742.199 lot of these people will get 25 to 40
6744.0 repetitions so we have a very specific
6746.04 breathing pattern it would be something
6747.239 like if we think that they're going to
6748.44 do around 25 reps say that's like our
6750.9 goal we might say okay do the first 10
6753.44 without a breath and then exhale reset
6756.6 and then do five breath and then you
6758.76 might do five breath three breath two
6761.639 breath and then one breath per rep until
6763.679 we can't get any more um so we'll have
6765.36 very specific strategies for them
6767.699 um so what I would say is think about
6769.26 how many you're going to complete and
6771.42 and then breathe according to that and
6773.94 it tends to increase in frequency as the
6776.219 number gets closer to failure because
6777.719 you're going to want that that error a
6779.219 little bit but you just want to make
6780.3 sure that
6781.5 when you re when you're breathing back
6783.659 in you're in a safe spot so you don't
6786.179 want to be catching that like re-breath
6788.699 when the weight's on you you want to be
6790.739 in a locked out position or away from
6792.36 you when you're standing so it tends to
6794.639 be like at the end of the exercise not
6796.739 in the middle of it which is is going to
6798.9 be a recipe for problems if you take
6800.34 your breath then
6802.199 one of the reasons I'm so happy to have
6804.179 you here
6805.139 and having this discussion is we can
6807.179 really get into the weeds but also hit a
6809.46 number of questions that I hear a lot
6811.4 how does one contend with the first
6814.86 attempt at a lift not working out is it
6817.32 too heavy something goes wrong hopefully
6819.9 not injury promoting wrong but something
6822.48 goes wrong do you count that do you
6824.58 reset the workout
6826.26 and then the counterpart to that
6828.36 question is
6830.159 what do you do if it's too easy it went
6832.5 wrong because you didn't put enough
6833.76 weight on the bar do you pick up a heavy
6835.26 enough set of dumbbells do you abandon
6836.88 the set and and replace it with another
6839.28 and I guess this is really a question of
6842.34 how much margin for error is there in
6844.98 volume yep when doing this three by five
6847.56 program sure uh two things
6850.679 that I'd like to start with number one
6852.0 is I talked about linear periodization
6853.98 and unrelated periodization there's
6855.119 actually a new model newish model called
6857.52 Auto regulation which basically says
6859.92 you're going to go in today and
6861.719 depending on any number of biomarkers
6863.94 performance markers or your performance
6866.159 you will adjust your training based on
6868.619 how you're feeling that day and so 70 is
6871.8 not maybe for example not necessarily 70
6873.78 of your one repetition Max highest ever
6877.02 is 70 of what you can actually do that
6879.48 day
6880.26 and so it actually allows you to Auto
6882.06 regulate your training based on actually
6883.739 what's happening and so you don't have
6885.54 to have as much long-term planning in
6887.46 your program design
6889.26 um because it'll sort of figure itself
6890.76 out as you're going you can use velocity
6892.86 to determine the sort of Regulation you
6894.659 can use actually it's like taking it up
6896.34 to close to a Max for the day and then
6898.739 basing all your percentages on that
6900.659 daily Max or a lot of different ways so
6902.76 that is actually one of very effective
6904.5 strategy and there's a lot of research
6906.6 coming out on auto regulation there's a
6907.98 lot of different ways to do it so that's
6911.219 one thing to say another thing to say is
6913.56 this
6914.639 three to five okay it depends on if
6917.699 we're going for speed power or strength
6919.139 because while all those other variables
6921.239 are the same for three to five
6922.86 the core difference between whether that
6924.6 is a power workout or a strength workout
6927.08 is the load
6929.34 right so if you are at a moderate load
6931.619 say thirty percent of your one
6932.76 repetition Max up to about 70 percent
6935.639 that's going to be a power based
6937.699 adaptation assuming you're going with
6940.139 high intent
6941.52 can you sorry I I have to interrupt
6944.159 maybe just clarify what intent is yeah
6946.98 you're attempting to move the implement
6948.78 or go through the movement pattern as
6951.06 fast as you can great thank you if
6953.4 you're trying to go for strength and
6955.139 you're below 70 percent
6957.42 you're not really going to be improving
6959.219 strength because the total mass
6961.32 is not heavy enough and so really when
6963.96 we say strength we're assuming you're at
6965.76 at least generally 70 percent or higher
6968.96 now if you're new to training totally
6972.239 different thing right but if you're
6973.38 moderately trained to highly trained
6975.0 you're going to be whale north of 70 so
6977.52 anything below that we don't really
6978.48 count anyways um that's those are
6980.34 warm-up sets basically
6982.139 all right so one thing to actually give
6984.48 you some very specific numbers here and
6986.159 I don't have all of these memorized who
6988.08 can perhaps
6989.28 um provide a chart later or send out
6991.56 something to them but there's a chart
6993.36 that you can look up called a prilippin
6995.04 chart how do you spell that uh p r i l i
6999.36 p i n
7000.94 and there's actually been a a few
7003.44 studies on it it's it's a it's been old
7006.02 it's been around for a very long time
7007.46 it's sort of in the coaching realm and
7009.02 then a handful of studies out of New
7010.4 Zealand came out
7011.56 verifying and validating a lot of it but
7013.82 what it effectively does is if strength
7015.56 is the goal and this comes from the
7017.3 power lifting weightlifting sort of
7018.679 communities or optimizing for strength
7020.659 then how much time do I need to spend
7023.719 at each intensity range so 70 80 90
7028.699 Etc because specificity
7031.34 is going to say this if you want to get
7033.86 better neuromuscular guy at shooting a
7036.739 basketball the most important thing you
7038.599 could ever do is shoot a basketball
7039.619 under the exact circumstances that
7042.199 you're going to do it right specificity
7043.94 always wins if you want to get better at
7046.4 strength the most important thing you
7048.199 need to do is that exact movement at
7050.119 that load and in this case if you wanted
7052.159 to get better at
7053.84 your bench press
7055.58 lifting at 100 of your max on a bench
7058.4 press is the most specific thing you
7060.02 could ever do the more you can do that
7061.94 the faster you will increase your bench
7064.04 press Max however that's very hard to do
7067.34 without getting hurt it's also not
7070.4 addressing what I call your Defender so
7072.679 if the reason you can't bench press
7074.239 higher than whatever you're benching now
7075.98 it may not be your pure strength it may
7078.5 be any number of things like you don't
7080.119 have enough muscle or technique or these
7082.4 things okay great so specificity over
7084.56 here
7086.06 um variation on the other side so we're
7088.46 playing this game we've talked about of
7089.96 how do I make sure that I can have
7091.82 enough specificity in my training
7093.44 without leading to uh overuse injury all
7098.3 how do I maximize or how do I reduce my
7100.88 chance of injury while getting enough
7102.02 specificity and so we have a classic
7103.699 Paradigm however here one actually
7105.86 training protocol you can look up is
7107.48 called a Bulgarian method and the
7109.4 bulgarians were an amazing at the sport
7112.52 of Olympic weightlifting probably in
7115.28 fact the
7117.92 um the the patriarch of this entire
7119.54 thing recently passed away Ivan IBA
7122.179 jayev uh niams glue pocket Hercules one
7125.48 of the greatest weightlifters of all
7126.5 time came out of the system and they do
7128.179 a lot of things but one example in the
7130.52 Bulgarian system is you're going to do a
7132.139 one repetition maximum snatch
7134.659 you're gonna take a little bit of a
7135.679 break you'll do a one repetition maximum
7137.54 cleaner jerk take a little bit of a
7138.86 break do a one repetition maximum front
7140.9 squat take a little bit of a break and
7142.58 you're gonna repeat that two to three
7143.659 times a day every day
7145.76 that's specificity right those people
7147.86 get extraordinarily strong now they
7150.199 don't do that all year round they don't
7151.46 do that with all their lifters but this
7153.32 is when we're trying to Peak for a major
7154.94 competition like the Olympics we are
7156.44 going so far
7158.06 into specificity and that was very
7160.52 counter to the Russian system at the
7162.199 time which is much more of our classic
7163.639 periodization sort of approach okay
7166.04 specificity is tremendous but in doing
7168.739 that the bulgarians just brutalized a
7170.96 lot of athletes right because it's very
7172.34 difficult to handle something like that
7173.659 and you can't really do that that long
7175.28 without getting wrecked and they're the
7177.02 goal is to win medals the goal is it's a
7179.0 totally different thing than longevity
7180.38 out of here right like we're trying to
7181.76 push the boundaries of or aesthetic
7183.739 changes unless someone has a naturally
7185.84 balanced Physique in general if people
7188.3 do one sort of movement I find that they
7190.82 tend to resemble the equipment that they
7192.56 did that movement with over time right
7194.659 that was a joke against kettlebells of
7196.58 course of course of course I got it
7198.8 so
7200.48 we know specificity is technically
7202.46 optimal but it's not realistic not for
7204.619 that kind of a you know extreme
7206.3 situation so how do we balance these
7208.639 things well it turns out this prilippin
7210.32 chart gives you guidelines for how much
7212.48 time and by time I mean how many
7213.92 repetitions
7215.3 to stand
7217.099 um in each of these rep ranges so that
7218.96 you get kind of the best of this world
7220.34 you're going to find the same thing by
7222.08 the way when we get into endurance
7223.159 training there's only so much training
7225.86 you can do at 95 of your heart rate
7227.54 before it starts becoming like quite
7228.92 detrimental you need to actually spend a
7230.9 lot of time at those lower intensities
7233.42 so the Philippine chart walks you
7235.099 through
7236.119 how many sets and it gives you a range
7238.219 like like the I think that the bottom of
7239.719 it is like
7240.92 um how much time do you spend at like 60
7242.719 to 70 every one or at Max and it says
7244.639 like you know minimum of this set to
7246.08 maximum of this set but the ideal number
7247.94 of reps per set per week is like 18. and
7250.34 then I'll walk you through and so
7251.239 there's there's four criteria on it
7253.58 um I think it's 55 to 65 again how many
7256.76 reps there's it's like three to six reps
7258.92 per set
7260.42 um 18 to 30 reps total and I think the
7264.619 ideal rep range is like 24. something
7266.9 like that so it takes you 55 to 65 70 to
7270.5 80 80 to 90 and the 90 plus percent what
7272.48 you'll see is the 90 plus percent number
7274.159 is more like one to two reps per set for
7277.82 a total of about seven total repetitions
7280.4 if you start cruising past that
7283.639 um
7284.42 other bad things start to creep up in
7286.52 there so that's a really effective chart
7288.199 what it really highlights though is even
7290.3 somebody who's trying to maximize
7291.56 strength
7292.699 you're going to spend something like 30
7295.699 five or so percent of your training time
7297.8 between this like 55 to 65 range
7301.58 so you're asking her like well do I even
7303.32 count that one the answer is yeah you
7305.599 know in that range if it's below 55 60
7308.3 percent you probably don't count it now
7310.76 again some coaches don't count unless
7312.139 it's even above 70. fine it's not a
7314.48 major distinction but you're going to
7315.86 spend the bulk of your time you know
7317.96 accumulating some some technique
7319.82 basically and skill and tissue tolerance
7321.92 very important The Next Step Up is like
7324.4 28 I think is is sort of the cutoff of
7327.56 how much time you spend between 70 and
7329.84 80 percent of your 100 Max and then it
7331.88 jumps down to like 23 and then all the
7334.219 way to 70 so you can walk yourself
7335.96 through that and that gives you an
7337.159 extremely good guideline and you'll
7339.38 notice all of these are still in three
7341.9 to five range it's just really you're
7343.88 manipulating it by total sets or total
7345.98 exercises so that can give you some
7347.48 instruction to play with
7349.04 we will provide a link to the prilippin
7352.28 Chart yeah in the show note captions
7355.58 training to failure when the goal is
7357.92 Strife yeah
7359.54 should one do it should one avoid it
7362.78 or does it depend well yeah it always
7364.88 depends um the way that I'll generally
7366.619 say it is because of what we just
7368.239 outlined it in the brilliant chart you
7369.98 don't have to go to failure to see
7371.239 strength gains especially early or even
7374.179 moderate and I'm talking maybe five plus
7376.159 years in your lifting career would you
7379.159 um call beginner zero to five years of
7381.619 training intermediate five to twenty
7384.38 years of training yeah something like
7386.78 that and then Advance would be people
7388.219 that really put the time and energy into
7389.719 fine-tuning their program the vast
7391.4 majority of people who think they're
7392.42 Advanced are really what we would call
7393.86 intermediate in all domains of life Fair
7397.36 even as a scientist
7399.86 um it's quite rare to reach that number
7401.36 of advance so
7402.98 um I actually don't have any problem
7404.119 going to failure quite often I'm also
7407.06 fine with people who don't want to go
7408.56 all the way there you can get most of
7410.36 what you need getting what we call
7411.98 technical failure so this is like okay
7415.4 that was really challenging uh boy you
7419.239 started to have some breakdowns of
7420.5 technique we're gonna call that good The
7422.48 Only Exception here I want to point out
7425.179 is people who are either novice or
7427.94 beginners they really have no concept of
7431.659 what 100 means and so I think it's
7434.48 actually very fruitful to take them to
7436.82 100 just to give them a guideline of
7439.52 where it's at now of course do this on
7442.159 exercises that they are comfortable with
7443.78 or close and then you maybe maybe this
7446.179 is on a machine maybe this is single
7448.76 joint movements or whatever it takes for
7450.32 them to have confidence but I actually I
7451.82 don't think you should be scared of
7453.44 these they're not really um that much
7455.78 more dangerous than anything else
7457.04 there's I mean think about it if you're
7459.08 going to do a front squat or any
7461.06 exercise and your one rep max is 200
7463.099 pounds is it really that much more
7465.199 dangerous to do one try at 205 pounds
7468.56 than it is to do five tries at 190
7471.56 pounds
7472.639 is it really that much more no like it's
7474.679 not so you can do like we talked about
7476.119 in the the first episode you can do a
7478.46 repetition Max estimate where you get to
7480.98 like 85 to 95 of where you think you are
7484.34 and then instead of adding load you just
7486.139 do as many reps as you can
7487.82 Google that number and it'll tell you
7489.44 the conversion estimate of what your own
7490.94 right Max is that's fine but also I have
7492.86 absolutely no issue in fact I generally
7495.26 encourage it to take people up to that
7497.599 level
7498.32 um certainly not day one or anywhere
7500.48 close to that but at some point let's
7502.159 see what you actually got
7503.78 I'm just I'm just going to cut it off
7505.52 early what I'm going to consider to be
7506.84 100 Max anything more than a minor
7509.54 technical breakdown is is for that crew
7511.639 we're going to stop and call that good
7513.08 and ideally with a spotter especially
7515.84 um you know bench pressing don't bench
7517.219 press alone in your basement kind of
7518.54 thing a few people die each year from
7520.219 bench pressing alone in their basement
7521.48 yep or use dumbbells if you're going to
7523.28 do that yeah it's hard harder to die
7525.5 using dumbbells I suppose you could
7528.5 um drop them on your head or something
7529.76 but not get stuck under them
7531.98 um
7532.94 exercise selection and frequency of
7535.94 exercise implementation across the week
7539.3 so I can imagine with this three by five
7542.36 routine done three to five times per
7544.88 week you can imagine changing up the
7547.099 exercises every workout
7548.86 although considering that most of these
7551.84 three by five routines are going to be
7554.179 done with compound movements generally
7556.58 the sooner or later one runs out of
7559.04 movements if the goal is to hit major
7562.58 all the major muscle groups yeah however
7564.44 let me give an example
7566.659 and ask if it's okay
7568.82 to for instance do the three by five
7570.739 routine where one of the exercises for
7573.38 back is say a bent over row
7576.08 uh you do that Monday Wednesday and
7577.88 Friday okay you know I can imagine one
7581.06 could do that and still recover and
7582.679 improve over time but five days a week
7584.9 bend over rows five days a week is that
7587.719 okay I mean can one still progress
7591.56 um and there I could imagine it's a
7594.26 strong answer of Depends because some
7596.36 people recover more slowly
7598.639 and others I'm very comfortable doing
7600.739 hitting muscle groups once directly per
7603.38 week and once indirectly that's worked
7605.06 for me far better than two or three
7607.04 times per week you know I get you know
7609.08 looks of sympathy when when I say this
7610.699 but it's actually it's just how my
7612.44 physiology Works
7614.179 um kind of yeah well and maybe I'm not
7616.219 optimizing a number of different
7617.239 features but the point being that some
7619.52 people really do seem to be able to
7621.38 train a muscle every day and still make
7624.5 progress other people seem to have
7627.38 trouble when they train a muscle every
7628.82 day so how does one establish exercise
7631.219 selection when the goal is to make
7633.38 progress
7634.94 um and this brings up something very
7636.8 important and we're going to have a
7637.88 whole episode about this but local
7639.98 versus systemic recovery yep that you
7642.619 know is the whole nervous system
7643.639 becoming fatigued
7645.32 and is the muscle group and the related
7649.34 musculoskeletal systems becoming
7651.44 fatigued we're going to go back to
7653.3 thinking about
7655.219 when you make these comments about it
7657.5 takes you three to five days and you've
7659.179 got better results in there the
7661.099 assumption that you're probably running
7662.9 under is your training Style
7665.96 is more reflecting that recovery time
7667.82 than it is your physiology
7670.159 it's not you it's how you're training so
7672.38 if you look at again all the Olympic
7674.719 weight lifters
7675.86 that are competing they're going to be
7677.36 squatting or some variation of squatting
7679.28 every day
7681.02 that that's going to happen like a lot
7682.94 of the times they're training multiple
7684.02 times a day and they will be doing some
7685.82 basically barbell full squat multiple
7688.28 times a day every day six days a week
7690.02 you know something like that
7692.42 they're the best in the world at getting
7693.619 powerful
7694.699 they're tremendously good at getting
7696.44 strong
7698.36 you can do it right it comes down to
7701.06 what does your volume look like what
7702.679 type of movements are you doing what rep
7705.08 range what overall volume are you
7707.179 hitting
7708.199 and how are you doing it if you look at
7709.82 athletes
7711.44 they train their legs every day
7713.78 when they're running around they're
7715.04 doing Speed and Agility training every
7717.139 single day they don't need you know
7719.239 three days to recover can you imagine a
7720.739 basketball player trying to ask for like
7722.0 three days to recover between practice
7723.199 right well to be fair as you as you
7725.0 chuckle at me I'm doing other things on
7727.699 the intervening days yeah so I'll train
7729.8 a muscle group like legs and then I'll
7731.9 give it four days before I do an
7733.52 indirect yeah um uh what I call an
7736.88 indirect exercise for legs which for me
7738.619 would be sprinting yep then I get two
7740.78 days and then I'm training them again
7742.159 but nonetheless an athlete has to do
7743.719 that every day right right so the
7746.179 absolute the answer is you absolutely
7747.619 can train any of these muscles every
7750.139 single day it really comes down to
7752.48 volume
7753.26 right and it comes down to movement type
7756.32 um and how are you getting it so with in
7758.239 the case of of weightlifters and
7759.619 athletes what we tend to see happen is
7761.42 there's not a there's two things there
7764.179 is a long period of conditioning and I
7766.82 don't mean endurance what I mean is is
7768.26 tissue tolerance and conditioning so
7769.699 they're not going to start off their
7771.199 career
7772.159 at that pace right their career might
7774.139 start off at five days a week but maybe
7777.02 every other of those days is a PVC pipe
7780.08 only and you're just training the
7781.76 movement patterns you're working on
7783.02 technique Etc and then eventually maybe
7785.0 after six months or a year those PVC
7787.82 pipe days turn into barbell only days so
7790.52 now you went from you know a pound to 45
7792.38 pounds and eventually as your years go
7794.48 on that that wrapses up so it depends on
7796.82 the style in general speed and power
7798.739 stuff is so light it almost requires
7801.98 because it's non-fatiguing it requires
7803.9 almost no amount of no recovery so if
7806.0 you were truly doing say like
7808.4 um you know when you say it's funny
7809.84 because when you say I do legs on
7811.28 Mondays
7812.42 you don't even realize it but an athlete
7815.96 does legs every day right but you're
7817.4 saying legs and what you're really
7818.54 saying is I do hypertrophy legs Mondays
7820.34 pretty much that I don't want to get
7821.9 into what I do specifically because it's
7823.82 less important than what other people
7824.96 choose to implement but the repetition
7826.639 ranges anywhere from 4 to 12. correct so
7830.659 you're covering up pretty yeah you're
7832.34 smack dead in the peak soreness
7834.92 longest recovery rate volume is
7836.9 relatively low intensity is very very
7838.46 high workouts are very very true so if
7840.44 you were to switch that and you were to
7842.3 stay under four repetitions higher
7844.699 quality uh higher rest in between them I
7846.679 would be willing to bet a large amount
7848.42 of money that you'd be fine the next day
7850.159 certainly 48 hours and if you were to
7852.86 actually go way lower and keep you know
7855.26 three to five and keep it very very
7857.06 light and train for Speed you would have
7858.32 absolutely no issue
7859.699 the next day so it really comes down to
7861.739 a function of training you're right in
7863.119 that hypertrophy Zone which is something
7864.8 that you probably need 48 hours at
7867.32 minimum to recover from because what you
7869.239 won't see
7870.52 are bodybuilders
7873.02 training the same muscle group on
7875.119 multiple days like very often at most it
7877.4 will be indirect but generally they're
7878.9 not going to do that every single day
7880.04 for the same reason so you're training
7882.26 in that style that's what it's going to
7884.239 take to recover if you trained in a
7885.619 different style then it wouldn't take
7887.3 that long to recover so for the person
7889.159 starting out
7891.02 would you recommend they pick three to
7892.58 five exercises and stick with those so
7894.739 that they can get their skill and
7896.659 movement and positioning and breathing
7898.4 all that really dialed in and then start
7900.8 to experiment by varying one or two of
7903.86 those exercises over time that's great
7905.78 if you look at the the conjugate model
7907.82 so these are the the strongest power
7909.38 lifters as a collective group that ever
7911.78 existed what they're very good at is
7913.219 they keep almost the exact same weekly
7914.659 structure but they make a very small
7917.06 change in exercise variation so for
7919.34 example say Wednesday is bench day right
7922.04 they're going to always binge on
7923.719 Wednesdays but maybe this week they're
7924.98 going to do close grip bench and then
7927.02 maybe next week it's going to be maybe a
7928.88 a special type of barbell and then maybe
7931.099 the week after that it's
7932.719 um you know maybe they'll change the
7934.58 range of motion a little bit so it's
7936.38 actually the exact same exercise where
7937.76 they're making a very small variation
7939.08 and that change alone allows them to do
7941.36 enough specificity
7942.92 but also gives them enough variation
7944.42 where it's not the exact same stimuli in
7946.52 the exact same spot over and over and
7948.619 over and that's what allows that group
7950.54 plus lots of other assistance but it's
7954.26 what allows that group to train very
7956.179 very very heavy
7957.5 very consistently and not have to worry
7959.36 about too much planning for
7961.04 periodization and other stuff like that
7962.599 they get their back off by making small
7965.06 variations in exercise I will say
7967.46 a major mistake folks do make is they
7969.619 change their exercises entirely way too
7972.139 often if I were to have to pick one or
7975.38 the other I would say don't change
7976.88 anything on your exercises for six weeks
7978.98 probably realistic maybe even 10 to 12
7981.739 weeks and then you can make some changes
7983.48 you should not be changing every single
7985.579 week the general pump you're just you're
7987.8 not going to see progress it's going to
7989.06 be very difficult to do that so it's
7991.04 going to take you three weeks generally
7993.32 to figure out the groove of the exercise
7994.94 to figure out how well you can load it
7996.739 what's too much to where you woke up
7998.54 unbelievably sore that was a train wreck
8000.639 how much do I load it at what position
8003.04 how long is this going to take it's
8004.0 going to take you three or so weeks and
8005.679 then you can really start pushing there
8007.659 so changing it before that or in that
8009.82 time frame is is you're not going to be
8011.56 able to progressively overload because
8012.699 you're just not going to know exactly
8013.719 where you're at on all the exercises so
8015.34 it's very important to create
8016.719 standardization within them and then see
8020.02 some progress in a movement or a muscle
8021.52 Group whatever you're going for
8023.199 and then make some changes
8025.119 so before we dive into our discussion
8027.159 about hypertrophy
8029.32 can we just get a brief recap of the
8032.32 general parameters for an excellent
8034.36 power and strength training program okay
8036.94 let me hit you with these rapid fire and
8038.92 you can maybe come ask questions along
8040.48 that remember those modifiable variables
8043.0 okay so let's go through them in order
8044.679 and then what they mean specifically for
8046.42 power versus strength so modifiable
8048.34 variable number one is called choice so
8050.98 which exercises do I select for strength
8053.139 in general for power or speed or
8055.719 strength we want to select compound
8057.639 movements you don't often see people
8059.56 doing maximum strength work for like a
8062.079 tricep Kickback right it's typically
8064.06 multiple joint movements and typically
8066.28 complex
8068.32 um movements
8069.88 in selecting these compound movements we
8072.46 generally want to actually think about
8073.36 exercise selection of movements rather
8075.76 than muscle groups so this is an
8077.679 important distinction because we'll see
8078.82 this is a different answer when we get
8079.9 hypertrophy what I mean by that is when
8082.0 we think about again strength training
8084.04 we tend to think about bodybuilding
8085.36 Concepts we go to the gym and we do
8086.86 things like I got to make sure I get my
8088.9 chest today and I got to make sure I get
8090.579 my hamstrings and now you're selecting
8092.8 exercises based on a muscle you want to
8094.54 work for strength development and power
8096.699 we want to think about movements rather
8099.04 than individual muscle groups so there
8100.78 should be like things like I need to
8102.639 train explosive hip extension which is
8105.4 like a a vertical jump or something like
8108.04 that I I want to train pushing or
8110.619 pulling movements or I want to attain
8112.36 road trip I want to train rotation which
8114.099 is a whole area we haven't gotten into
8115.42 which is very important for overall
8117.639 health and wellness and Longevity so we
8119.92 want to select big movements by the
8122.02 muscle the movement patterns that we
8123.88 want to introduce and we just want to
8125.199 select a reasonable balance between
8128.56 these I don't care what the exact ratio
8130.78 is you just don't want to go an entire
8133.0 six months without doing anything in
8135.4 this rotational area or an entire you
8137.98 know eight to ten weeks without doing
8140.38 something
8142.079 without the lower body hinge right so
8145.119 any number of examples there so just
8147.04 think about the rough movement patterns
8148.48 upper and lower push and pull and then
8151.48 some sort of rotation that puts you in a
8153.34 pretty good spot if you're using three
8154.54 by five method and you're going to pick
8157.0 as little as three exercises just pick
8158.92 one from each one of those group pick a
8160.54 rotation
8161.619 pick a push and pick a pull I can easily
8164.8 think of a pushing a pull so for example
8167.619 bench press or shoulder press sure row
8170.92 or chin for pull and then squat or
8173.32 deadlift for hinge yep what would be a
8176.02 good example of a quality rotational
8178.48 movement yep so anytime um you can use a
8181.78 cable machine like at the gym and you
8184.0 can do it's kind of hard to describe
8185.56 this exercise but basically you're going
8186.88 to stand facing the cable and you're
8189.699 going to pull it towards yourself and
8190.9 then rotate like you're pivoting like
8192.219 your either swing angle golf club or
8195.04 hitting a baseball bat so you're facing
8196.78 One Direction I'm facing you right now
8198.639 I'm pulling the cable towards myself and
8200.439 then I'm going to spin do a 180 degree
8202.42 pivot and face exactly away from you
8204.58 when I finish and then return it back to
8207.099 that same spot so that's a rotation
8208.599 great we will provide a link to an
8210.46 example of that that you consider a
8212.26 quality example a medicine ball throw
8214.059 any number of things like this are a
8217.059 great rotational exercise all right so
8219.939 we select our exercises based on that we
8222.46 generally then okay because that is the
8224.439 case we don't worry about things like
8226.26 eccentric versus concentric because
8228.34 you're deadly doing a whole body
8230.16 athletic movement right which The
8232.54 Eccentric concentric portion is going to
8234.399 be folded into that you really can't
8236.32 separate them out all right so that's
8238.54 exercise Choice our first variable the
8240.639 next one is exercise order so because
8243.16 that everything driving power and
8245.5 strength is quality based
8248.08 you want to do these at the beginning of
8250.059 your workout you would not want to do
8251.859 anything fatiguing before this so no
8254.92 cardiovascular training no other
8257.32 repetition to failure stuff if you do
8259.599 those before and now you're slower all
8262.54 you've done is practice getting slower
8264.28 and and so these need to be done when
8266.26 you're fresh you also need to do them
8267.639 when you're very fresh because they are
8269.2 the most neurologically demanding
8270.46 they're complicated they tend to have
8272.08 multiple steps and they're often in
8273.58 multiple planes and coordination is a
8275.5 difficult thing and if you're trying to
8276.939 do all that at maximum speed your
8279.099 nervous system needs to be tremendously
8280.359 fresh and so any amount of fatigue here
8282.04 is only going to compromise the results
8284.679 um to kind of recap that one of the
8287.139 major mistakes when training for
8288.28 strength and especially power is people
8290.32 worry way too much about fatigue those
8292.359 things should not be part of the
8293.38 equation in fact if they are that's a
8296.019 very good sign you're not doing this
8297.16 correctly right these are non-fatiguing
8299.5 movements especially speed and Power
8302.08 so Choice order is next
8304.74 the next one after that is volume and we
8307.3 sort of hit volume and intensity which
8309.82 is the other one we talked about that
8312.639 the volume is basically identical
8315.46 between power and strength the the
8318.58 general number we're going to look at
8319.78 here is something like 3 to 20 sets
8322.059 total per workout per workout
8325.12 um but that would be like 20 would be
8327.34 a little bit of a special case now three
8329.32 to five is what I told you earlier right
8331.12 I'm just saying like sometimes you can
8332.62 actually go quite higher in this cases
8334.719 but that's the general range and once
8337.78 somebody finishes the three by five
8339.399 workout for power or strength if they
8343.359 decide they want to throw in some calf
8345.46 raises and curls and totally a forearm
8347.74 work or a little bit of jogging on the
8350.2 treadmill or something that's okay
8351.88 absolutely there is you have very little
8354.76 risk of interference
8356.859 for things like speed and Power
8358.96 strength you have a little bit of a risk
8361.54 only because now you're introducing
8363.58 fatigue which if you're really pushing
8365.5 strength that might compromise your
8367.479 recovery I could imagine doing the three
8369.639 to five routine for strength or for
8371.559 power and then somebody finishing up
8373.66 with
8374.679 um 10 or 15 minutes of hypertrophy arm
8376.719 work and then being very seriously
8379.54 compromised if they try and come in the
8381.04 next day or even the next day correct
8382.66 and do those big compound movements for
8385.3 Speed and power that's right not just
8387.46 because they're sore but the muscles may
8389.14 actually still be damaged and I know
8391.479 later we're going to talk about the
8393.28 um somewhat tenuous relationship between
8394.96 soreness and Recovery yeah yep so that
8397.84 that's a that's a really nice uh
8399.399 heuristic to pay attention to is you can
8402.04 but just be careful
8403.66 Energy starts to matter at that point if
8406.54 you're really truly trying to maximize
8408.22 strength you would do nothing at all
8411.04 outside of that training if you're just
8413.38 like I kind of want to get stronger and
8414.64 some other things and you're willing to
8416.5 lose strength you know five percent of
8418.42 your strength gains then you're totally
8420.88 fine um the same can be said by the way
8422.56 for super setting so supersetting is an
8425.26 idea that says like wait a minute you're
8426.939 telling me dude I gotta take five
8429.1 minutes in between each set well that's
8432.16 not so much a problem nowadays with
8433.66 phone with um smartphones because people
8436.18 are filling their intercept intervals
8439.0 with social media and texting correct
8441.399 you you don't really have to go that
8443.38 long in fact there was actually a study
8444.939 that came out in the last month that
8446.439 showed you know like really two minutes
8447.819 is probably sufficient for most people
8449.8 having said that if you really are
8452.08 trying to push maximal strength
8453.76 adaptations like three to five is very
8455.38 very reasonable
8457.18 um your those training sessions are long
8459.399 because you have to take you're spending
8461.26 more time not doing anything
8462.88 then you are doing something but you're
8464.439 trying to maximize quality so that's
8466.24 just sort of like part and parcel if
8468.1 you're not super worried about it you
8469.72 can actually do super setting which is
8471.04 let's imagine again you're going to do
8472.72 some some lunges and while your legs are
8475.6 resting doing their three to five
8476.92 minutes you can go over and do an upper
8478.84 body row or pull
8481.0 and when your upper body is resting
8482.319 you're going back the legs so that
8483.7 really Cuts your time in half is it
8485.92 ideal no we actually ran a study uh
8488.2 maybe 10 years ago in our lab and we
8490.359 looked at that specifically and we did
8492.16 see a reduction in strength performance
8493.72 in the supersetting group relative to
8495.399 the group who did not superset
8497.319 the question then it becomes like is it
8499.06 enough for you to care so if you were to
8500.979 if I were to say hey I can cut an hour
8502.66 off of your workout time but you will
8505.06 lose five percent of your strength gain
8506.859 almost everyone would take that exchange
8508.899 with the exception of people who are
8510.52 getting close to competition or really
8512.56 trying to set a new lifetime PR or
8515.08 something then you might say no I don't
8516.819 want any interference there that last
8518.38 little margin is what I care about give
8520.24 me the extra rest great so it's not a
8523.3 does it work does it not work it's
8524.62 always a what are you willing to give up
8526.3 uh versus get the practicalities of
8529.18 supersetting are staggering push-pull
8531.1 push pull in my mind are real because
8533.859 you have to take over large segments of
8536.319 the gym which oftentimes leads to a
8538.66 situation where your rest times are too
8541.6 long or highly variable because people
8543.58 are working in or you can't finish your
8545.08 set because now someone jumped into the
8546.46 machine right it totally screws right
8547.96 you lose three to five of your friends
8549.58 because it's obnoxious when you're
8551.68 taking over all the equipment but in all
8553.24 seriousness I think
8554.8 um it's wonderful if you have the space
8556.78 and the format to do it but at least in
8559.24 my experience end observation these
8561.52 people know who they are it's not
8563.8 practical to do on a regular basis if
8566.319 you train in an open commercial gym yeah
8568.42 tough to pull up so
8570.88 um
8571.6 we've covered choice
8573.399 order volume and intensity to a
8576.34 sufficient level the last one is
8577.78 frequency and we've already sort of
8579.58 indirectly talked about that where
8580.84 frequency can be as high as you'd like
8582.46 in this area it really depends on your
8584.5 recovery if you're really truly pushing
8586.24 maximum strength you probably do need a
8589.18 few days to recover although that's
8591.1 dependent upon you but speed and power
8592.479 can be done multiple times a day almost
8594.04 every day basically the one exception
8596.439 would be maximum sprinting speed you
8599.2 need to be careful there for things like
8600.64 hamstring and injury especially if
8602.62 you're pretty fast so you want to be a
8604.06 little bit cautious of that but if
8605.56 you're doing easier movements like
8607.84 medicine ball throws or kettlebell
8609.34 swings or something you could do those
8610.479 quite often as long as the volume is is
8612.7 staying pretty low
8614.319 last little piece here is progression
8616.479 how do I progress over time
8618.399 so I mentioned this earlier but just
8619.72 want to fill this Gap right back in
8620.979 before we head over to hypertree which
8622.479 is three to five percent increase per
8625.0 week of intensity in general and you can
8628.3 do upwards of about five percent
8629.62 increase in volume per week over time
8631.479 and I generally recommend running that
8633.34 for at longest eight weeks
8636.46 but probably most realistically you want
8638.56 to go about five weeks or so and then
8641.02 have some sort of a deload or back off
8643.359 week if you do that you're generally
8645.58 going to be a pretty good spot so those
8647.979 are like the Core Concepts now
8650.14 there's a whole bunch of fun methods you
8653.02 can play with within all these
8654.76 categories and I I would like to
8656.5 actually cover just a couple of them
8658.359 um if we've got a little more space for
8659.68 that sure I'd love to hear about those
8662.26 I'd like to also just cue up one which
8665.56 is well I joked about people texting and
8668.5 doing social media between sets and I
8670.96 that's not a joke well I confess I
8673.06 stopped bringing my phone into the gym
8675.18 because of the urge to you know take my
8679.3 mind off of the workout and I just
8680.62 started enjoying my workouts a lot more
8682.18 yeah and the workouts go far better that
8685.12 way and they're just much more efficient
8686.859 it for me I realize that some people
8688.84 their careers take place in the gym and
8690.64 so for the I don't
8692.2 um look down upon anyone using their
8694.0 phone at the gym but that really tends
8695.74 to help me but I do wonder whether or
8698.68 not there's an optimal Behavior or
8702.1 mindset in between sets I've heard
8705.28 before that pacing around can actually
8707.319 help diffuse some of the lactate and
8710.02 other metabolic byproducts of of work
8713.2 and exertion yeah that can lead to
8715.12 better performance I've also heard that
8717.64 um you know shaking the muscles out I
8719.56 mean there's all sorts of gym lore
8721.84 um about this but maybe there's also
8723.819 some decent science I'm just curious uh
8725.979 if you have any specific recommendations
8728.74 that people could play with or try yep
8730.84 so for for Speed and Power
8733.6 you want to walk this balance of stiff
8737.439 but fresh
8738.88 and so if you were to literally finish a
8740.74 repetition sit on a bench for five
8742.42 minutes you would stand up after that
8743.8 fairly stiff and you wouldn't feel sort
8745.899 of smooth this is all
8747.46 so this is an all-known science this is
8749.26 all
8750.22 practical application right data
8752.62 anecdata there you go strength is a
8754.899 little bit different but it's the same
8756.04 concept you're walking that line in
8758.5 general a lot of the times if you see
8760.18 Power lifters and weightlifters in
8761.5 between sets they're going to sit down
8762.7 and not move for hypertrophy can be a
8764.74 little bit different because you're
8765.46 getting towards fatigue and so the
8767.14 factors you mentioned like clearing
8768.76 lactate well first of all lactate is not
8770.319 actually causing fatigue that's that's a
8772.96 giant myth that will which is why I teed
8774.88 it up no I'm just kidding
8776.92 um but in the case of again speed power
8778.359 you're not going to fatigue so fatigue
8779.62 Management's not really an issue you
8781.06 want to make sure that you're getting
8782.02 complete neurological recovery which is
8783.88 a little bit slower than muscle
8785.68 energetically you're not out of any gas
8787.6 whatsoever right um You are not a lack
8790.359 of fuel
8791.319 you know doing three repetitions of a
8793.12 vertical jump yep no plenty of glycogen
8795.52 totally what about stretching between
8797.92 sets yeah you probably don't want to do
8800.26 that either there are very clear
8802.06 examples of pre-exercise stretching
8805.0 static stretching being quite
8806.74 detrimental for maximum power production
8808.479 the same thing for speed and strength
8810.58 and that's been shown actually a number
8811.78 of times in a number of Laboratories
8813.28 which is like a a classic Hallmark any
8815.68 scientist looks for of like really
8818.26 jumping on board with an idea if it's
8820.12 shown not only multiple times but in
8821.74 multiple Laboratories for multiple
8823.06 scientists and they're all seeing the
8824.439 same thing you start to get a lot of
8826.3 confidence that that's a real finding
8827.56 and that's been shown we've done that in
8829.359 our Center for sport performance not
8831.22 myself but one of my colleagues has done
8832.84 a lot of stretching research and he's
8833.92 seen that a lot on everything from
8835.479 vertical jump to ISO kinetic
8837.64 dynamometers and enforce velocity curves
8840.1 and there's we've seen this as printing
8842.26 we've seen this in speed we've seen this
8843.58 in loaded stuff so you don't want to
8845.859 spend a ton of time stretching
8847.12 statically stretching a muscle
8848.979 priority if you do that and you have to
8850.96 do that say say for example you finish
8852.28 that you're just like feeling really
8853.359 tight yeah go ahead like you need to get
8855.52 in the right position especially for
8857.08 most people where are you willing to
8859.0 sacrifice 10 of power to make sure you
8861.34 don't get hurt yes that answer is almost
8863.68 always yes outside of some very specific
8865.96 athlete scenarios so if you're not in
8868.6 the right position I actually remember
8870.399 having this conversation with Kelly uh
8872.26 Kelly started a long time ago it was
8873.7 just like yeah fine I'll lose five
8875.319 percent if that means I'm not going to
8876.88 get in a bad position and
8878.38 hurt my back and I totally totally agree
8880.96 so if you got to open up a hip or an
8882.819 ankle or something to get there get in
8884.68 the right position number one we'll live
8886.54 with the five percent reduction in power
8888.04 and if you do just reactivate
8890.56 so before you go do your working set go
8892.24 do something fast again a vertical jump
8893.92 a short Sprint acceleration and sort of
8896.02 get that system cleared back up
8898.66 um if you didn't stretch it for long
8900.399 enough and you didn't hold it for long
8901.96 enough you should be able to be just
8904.06 fine so when it comes to hypertrophy now
8907.3 you can really stretch all you want
8908.26 because we're not it's not driven by
8910.24 intensity or outcome it's being driven
8911.979 by an insult into the tissue and so if
8914.2 you're pre-fatigue for hypertrophy it
8915.7 doesn't matter if you're pre-stretched
8917.38 that doesn't matter we're not going for
8919.54 quality of outcome we're going for
8920.859 quality of internal signal which is not
8923.319 going to be changed by your Force output
8925.66 so it doesn't really matter
8928.18 you mentioned a few other things that
8929.8 one might consider in light of uh the
8932.8 list that you provided of choice order
8935.02 volume frequency and progression right
8937.899 so starting off with power I just wanted
8940.18 to hand
8941.2 the The Listener issue with a whole
8942.88 bunch of different methods to go play
8944.14 with right so as long as you get those
8945.76 Concepts the repetition range for power
8948.34 30 to 70 percent of your one repetition
8950.8 Max depending on the exercise and your
8952.78 training status
8954.64 um you're going to get the power as long
8956.319 as you're attempting to go fast it's
8957.52 gonna be great a lot of things you can
8958.96 try applyometrics are a great example of
8963.52 things that are effective for
8965.92 um for power development we've mentioned
8967.54 medicine ball throws
8969.16 short Sprints you can even do Sprints uh
8971.8 unlike an air bike which is a great
8974.56 super safe activity you can do them from
8976.72 Like a Rolling start where you kind of
8978.1 like get going a little bit and then you
8979.78 explode for five seconds and see how
8981.58 fast you can get or a dead start like
8983.979 both of those are very very acceptable
8985.8 weight lifting movements so snatches and
8988.24 cleaning jerks are tremendously
8990.1 effective in fact they are pound for
8991.6 pound by far the most effective exercise
8994.66 choice for power development like
8996.16 without question so those are good ones
8998.319 clapping push-ups speed squats these are
9001.08 all a whole host of different things
9002.52 that you can do for Speed and power
9004.14 development I'm depending on your
9005.939 kettlebell swings another great one all
9009.0 these can be done depending on your
9010.319 preference exercise availability what's
9012.899 at your gym or not gym any of those
9015.12 things
9016.02 if somebody is more focused on strength
9018.42 as opposed to power
9020.04 what are the additional variables they
9021.96 should consider again within the context
9024.42 of this overarching theme of choice
9026.76 order volume frequency and progression
9029.819 absolutely it's almost identical with a
9032.16 couple of small exceptions number one
9033.84 you probably can't do as many working
9036.3 sets
9037.5 per week for strength because now you're
9039.479 introducing a heavier load and that's
9041.22 going to represent some sort of fatigue
9044.52 load on the tissue all those things so
9046.8 you could probably get away with doing
9048.479 20 sets of two
9050.399 of a vertical jump
9052.439 four or five times a week you probably
9054.42 couldn't do that at a 90 on squat right
9057.3 so the total amount of sets and the
9058.979 total amount of weekly load you can get
9060.3 to just needs to be lower and then the
9062.22 intensity right so we talked about that
9063.54 needs to be generally higher than 70
9065.359 yeah with you know some portion of that
9067.979 being working sets at some point so that
9069.479 really truly being at 90 plus everything
9072.3 else is pretty identical you still want
9075.12 to emphasize maximum speed despite the
9077.34 fact you may actually not be moving
9078.84 faster because you've introduced load
9080.52 you still need to be attempting that but
9082.26 you're going to be picking complex
9083.28 exercises you're generally going to be
9085.56 hedging more towards
9087.54 barbells and machines so this is a case
9090.12 where bodyweight training can be
9093.24 effective again particularly for the
9095.22 upper body but at some point you're
9097.5 really going to have to move past that
9098.819 because there's just a certain amount of
9100.439 load you can't put on the lower body
9102.479 with just your body weight you get
9104.399 limited by how much you weigh or I mean
9107.16 there's a couple of things you can do
9108.12 but you're going to run out past that
9109.979 pretty quickly and so in when it comes
9112.62 to strength they tend to be less
9113.939 athletic movements because you know we
9117.0 have to have a barbell on us we have to
9118.68 have a we have to be on a machine or
9120.18 something like that and so that's a
9122.1 subtle difference in exercise choice we
9124.439 need to also be careful about The
9125.76 Eccentric portion and things like that
9127.74 we don't have as much risk in like a
9130.14 speeder power one so um some of the
9132.3 different things you can play with there
9134.04 we've talked about doing things like
9135.6 pushes and pulls I also love carries so
9138.54 a farmer's carry pushing a sled dragging
9141.84 a sled all kinds of things a yoke walk
9143.819 all kinds of carry modalities that are
9146.7 very very effective for strength um
9149.22 there's eccentric overload
9151.439 training which we really haven't gone
9152.819 into but it's a really Advanced
9153.899 technique where you can actually load at
9155.88 greater than 100 percent
9157.8 of your one repetition Max but you're
9159.96 only going to do The Eccentric portion
9161.58 of it so physiologically you are much
9163.74 stronger eccentrically than you are
9165.12 concentrically for a variety of of
9167.52 muscle tissue reasons actually and so
9170.16 imagine if you can do a bench press at
9172.02 200 pounds and what you might actually
9173.7 do is load it to 220 and you would have
9176.28 a spotter and maybe even use it in a
9178.2 rack and you would lower it Down Under
9179.52 Control all the way to the bottom and
9181.859 then stop
9182.7 your friends would lift it back up the
9184.56 top and you just practice that eccentric
9186.72 portion you would actually be able to
9187.859 lower say 220 pounds effectively despite
9190.14 the fact that you wouldn't have been
9191.22 able to lift it back up you don't need
9193.38 to start there but that is a very
9194.88 effective method for increase in fact
9197.359 arguing one of my um one of my doctoral
9199.859 students right now is doing a project on
9201.54 this at USC
9203.28 and he uh like he's focusing directly on
9205.68 this and it's it's quite clear this
9207.72 oftentimes more effective at strength
9209.7 development than anything else because
9210.66 you can actually just like in the speed
9212.399 example where you want to actually
9213.78 practice moving faster so instead of
9215.88 practicing 100 of you on our Max for
9217.74 strength you actually practice that
9218.939 higher than that to get better at it so
9221.939 that's that's another much more advanced
9224.399 tool
9225.96 please don't let me get sued by saying
9227.88 all that like folks be careful make sure
9230.46 you're doing the proper exercise in your
9231.899 positioning and like caveat caveat
9233.76 caveat okay
9235.38 um but outside of that it can be it's
9237.18 totally fine and safe yeah with it when
9239.76 people get injured they can't train you
9241.319 can't train you don't progress you lose
9243.899 progress so uh certainly that's worth
9246.06 highlighting so two more
9247.8 um a little more advanced techniques
9249.12 that I want to throw out there and one
9250.439 of them is called cluster sets so
9252.479 cluster sets are there's a bunch of ways
9254.28 to do it but imagine taking a mini break
9256.02 in between every single repetition
9258.78 so say you're going to do five
9259.92 repetitions yeah in a row what you're
9262.5 actually going to do is do one
9263.28 repetition
9264.479 set it down pause for five to ten
9267.0 seconds
9268.2 and then do the next one
9270.24 pause do the next one pause pause pause
9272.46 pause pause so you can imagine doing
9274.38 like a squat and you're gonna go down
9276.42 explode up and you're standing you're
9277.979 going to Rack it out
9279.24 you're gonna kind of like shake back out
9280.62 catch your breath
9282.42 walk back in do another one
9285.42 rock it out and you can repeat that
9287.16 until you've executed your three or four
9289.02 or five repetitions and then you take
9290.64 your three to five minute break before
9292.62 your next step
9293.819 that is an incredibly effective way for
9295.92 both strength power and actually even
9298.08 hypertrophy because you can keep the
9300.3 quality the force output the power
9302.76 output very very very high because
9304.859 you're getting these little mini breaks
9306.3 and you're not getting fatigue setting
9308.04 in by the time you're say third or
9309.6 fourth or fifth repetition in that set
9312.56 after repetition one
9315.479 you start to see very small subtle
9317.34 reductions power up but because you
9319.14 start to see a little bit of fatigue you
9321.24 you take those five to ten seconds off
9322.92 even up to 20 seconds you can actually
9324.359 do it you don't see any drop and enforce
9327.3 output over the course of the five and
9328.62 so what you really have done is you've
9330.12 gotten five in this example
9332.46 first repetitions which is the way we
9335.22 will kind of say it right so all five of
9336.6 those have the same quality as rep
9338.64 number one which is again as we're
9340.8 talking that's the driver and strength
9342.899 and so that's the one we want to
9343.859 preserve so it takes a little bit longer
9346.859 for some exercises it's not very good
9349.74 it's great for like a deadlift because
9351.78 you set it back down check it back out
9353.399 re-grip hard to do with the bench you
9355.319 got to re-rack it back in then re-rack
9356.939 it back out that's like kind of a pain
9358.319 in the ass so there's some exercises
9360.479 that doesn't work well with and some
9361.92 that it does but cluster sets and a lot
9364.74 of research on those
9366.96 um very effective would you recommend if
9369.54 somebody's doing cluster sets that they
9370.979 do them for every session within that
9372.96 week or just this is an occasional thing
9374.939 you could do it this could be your
9376.74 training strategy yeah absolutely so you
9378.96 can really take it that seriously um in
9380.819 fact like if you look at again the
9381.84 weight lifters
9382.92 they will do cluster sets by default not
9385.26 even trying still say they'll do like a
9386.7 clean and then they'll drop the weight
9388.26 back out they're supposed to be doing
9389.399 say a set of three but almost always
9391.08 they're gonna like shake it out re-grip
9392.819 and then pull it again and sometimes
9393.899 they're set of three takes like a minute
9395.22 and then like you hear it's funny
9396.96 because it's like like a I set a triple
9399.18 PR you're like no you did three singles
9401.58 like what's the difference between doing
9403.14 three singles and a set of three when
9404.28 you took a minute between each rep
9406.68 um I love that community so
9408.54 yeah I mean it could be your strategy
9409.92 like it could be like hey for this
9411.24 five-week block this is all my training
9413.7 especially for your compound movements
9415.26 if you're gonna go to start doing some
9416.58 of the smaller movements Maybe
9418.14 you give up on that um it could also
9420.06 just be something you do for your one
9421.62 primary exercise for the day
9423.54 so do that thing that is the most
9424.979 important first and just do it for that
9426.479 one and then the rest of them you can
9427.56 kind of ditch it if you need to save a
9429.3 little bit of that time it can also be
9431.28 something you do by feel
9432.84 so you know you're two reps in and you
9434.76 go God like I'm not feeling like poppy
9436.439 here like re-rack it catch my breath for
9438.3 a quick second and do it so it doesn't
9439.5 have to be ultra planned I guess what
9441.78 I'm doing is is I'm giving you an excuse
9444.96 to make sure you're super fresh for
9446.819 every rep it matters the last one I want
9449.64 to talk about here
9450.96 is what's called Dynamic variable
9453.12 resistance so Dynamic variable
9455.399 resistance is uh fixing the problem we
9459.18 have with What's called the human
9460.2 strength curve so theory of constraints
9463.2 again you're only as strong as you are
9465.6 in your weakest point of the movement so
9468.3 depending on the the movement you do
9469.68 this happens at a different range of
9471.06 motion well the deadlift has used this
9473.939 example it's also because we've done
9475.92 like research in my lab using this stuff
9478.319 on the deadlift so I can speak to it
9480.12 very directly when you go to pull it off
9481.92 the ground some people are going to fail
9483.18 right at the bottom meaning they won't
9484.859 get the weight off the ground at all
9486.12 some people will feel just below the
9487.8 knees that's likely kind of like the
9489.6 hardest transition period and then some
9491.64 people will feel right at the top just
9493.979 before they can lock out okay great so
9496.62 what that means is at some point of that
9498.6 lift
9500.22 you're going to only be limited by your
9502.74 strength in the weakest area
9504.66 all right
9505.8 so if you have a constant load on the
9508.26 bar in those other two parts of the
9510.54 range of motion where you are not the
9512.76 weakest
9513.78 they are never truly being tested for
9515.939 their maximum strength because they're
9517.14 always being limited by the previous one
9518.52 and this is the same argument that we
9520.62 would get into if people ask about
9521.76 should I what do you think about using
9523.38 straps
9525.0 right strapping your hand to a bar for
9527.7 deadlift things like that there's pros
9529.319 and cons here there are times when you
9530.88 want to use a strap and there are times
9532.08 when it's a bad idea so what dynamic
9534.42 variable resistance is is either using
9536.22 things like a heavy band or or chains on
9539.34 the bar if you've ever seen people do
9540.479 that so in my lab we actually have a
9542.58 force plate on the ground and then we
9543.96 have built-in basically hooks in the
9547.859 front and back so we can actually set a
9549.359 barbell on top of the force plate where
9551.1 you stand on it and then run bands from
9553.14 the back to the front running over top
9554.64 of the weights and so when you stand up
9557.16 as you're going up vertically the bands
9559.62 are getting Tighter and Tighter and
9560.64 pulling the weight towards the ground so
9562.56 the weight is getting heavier and
9563.76 heavier as you stand up
9565.62 so as you start to gain mechanical
9567.899 advantage in your positioning you start
9570.479 to increase load because the bands are
9572.939 getting Tighter and Tighter and Tighter
9574.14 so this allows you to train that full
9576.66 part of the strength curve and to
9578.52 challenge your stronger areas with
9581.22 heavier weight and your weaker areas
9582.96 with lower weight you can do the same
9585.479 thing with a bench press you can do it
9587.04 with a squat and any other exercise
9588.96 variation and dynamic variable
9590.7 resistance is incredibly effective
9593.76 for a number of things you're going to
9596.939 give up a little bit
9598.76 because the total load you can put on
9601.319 the barbell is lower because you're
9603.06 going to be adding you know in large
9604.439 cases several hundred pounds of band
9606.0 tension and so it pros and cons
9610.02 so it's always a game it changes the
9612.0 curve but it's it's a very good
9613.62 technique
9615.42 um that that people is fairly easy to
9616.92 implement it's fun in fact if you try
9619.08 this on on a bench or a squat you're
9620.7 gonna be the first time you give it a go
9622.2 you're like oh my God because the bands
9623.88 are pulling you all over the place
9625.5 um so you have to get very stable very
9626.819 quick
9627.899 um been shown a number of times a
9629.28 handful of studies out of many
9630.3 Laboratories to be a very effective
9632.04 training technique a little bit more
9633.78 advanced but I want to throw that in
9635.16 there for the folks that are maybe just
9636.84 tired of sort of doing the same barbells
9639.06 and doubles and machines and you want to
9640.62 try something different a very effective
9642.24 technique sounds like fun yeah it's
9644.22 great with your permission I'm going to
9645.84 read back my summary list of training
9648.24 for power and training for strength
9649.859 according to your description and you
9651.78 can tell me where I'm right and where
9652.92 I'm wrong
9654.24 I'm going to pick three to five
9655.8 exercises and these should be compound
9658.38 exercises so multi-joint movements
9660.72 I'm going to perform those exercises for
9663.72 three to five repetitions each
9666.96 I'm going to do three to five movements
9669.42 total per workout
9671.34 and I'm going to rest three to five
9673.439 minutes between sets
9675.66 okay if I'm training for power
9678.06 the weight loads on the work set so not
9680.7 the warm-up sets but the work sets are
9684.12 going to fall somewhere in the range of
9685.859 30 to 70 percent of my one repetition
9688.319 maximum yep and the larger the movement
9691.319 the higher that number goes so on a
9694.319 squat you're okay getting 50 or 60 on a
9696.78 bench you would not want to go that high
9698.52 you would want to stay close enough 30
9700.319 to 40 range so the way you scale that up
9702.54 and down is dependent upon the
9704.34 difficulty of the movement great
9707.1 if training for strength I'm going to
9709.859 have my work sets be
9713.04 70 or more of my one repetition maximum
9716.64 yep and the only thing to add there is
9719.7 in the case of actually all of them
9722.28 um it's okay to go less than three reps
9724.74 per set so a single or a double one or
9728.04 two represent is also fantastic so uh we
9730.74 use three to five as the concept but
9732.24 less is okay going more than that is
9734.7 generally not a good idea so less is
9736.68 okay more is generally not okay and then
9739.14 you listed off a number of really
9741.479 valuable I don't even want to call them
9743.64 fine points but important points to keep
9746.04 in mind within each and both of these
9748.68 programs one that really stands out in
9750.72 my mind
9752.1 is this idea of
9753.96 if I perform this three by five program
9756.439 but I'm also including some hypertrophy
9759.6 work for arms or calves or muscle groups
9762.6 that might not be hit as directly
9765.54 as one might like during the three by
9767.7 five component that's okay but do that
9770.28 after the three by five Training and
9772.68 keep in mind that that additional work
9775.74 can potentially compromise recovery for
9777.96 the three by five power promoting or
9780.0 strength promoting program the example
9782.46 being for instance if one does arm work
9785.96 on the first workout of the week or even
9788.88 the you know the third workout of the
9790.56 week or the fifth workout of the week
9792.42 and that arm work is higher repetition
9794.28 hypertrophy directed work it's
9796.979 reasonable to assume that it might
9799.26 impede some of the three by five power
9801.42 promoting or strength promoting training
9803.1 in the subsequent workout so just to be
9805.08 mindful of that and perhaps throttle
9807.24 back on the intensity or the volume or
9809.28 if my goal is strictly power or strictly
9813.06 strength probably best to leave out
9815.399 other forms of training yep love it one
9819.54 last little thing I don't think we did
9820.8 Justice is intention
9823.26 and the reason I want to go back to this
9825.3 now is because
9826.8 we've talked a lot about specific loads
9829.02 you have to hit
9830.46 and that's generally the case but if
9833.16 intention is there you can fudge those
9835.38 numbers in terms of how much load goes
9837.24 on the bar in fact you can get as low as
9838.74 no load on the bar a great example here
9841.62 is like a plank exercise so you can do a
9844.02 plank in which you get in a position and
9845.52 you simply contract the least amount
9848.16 necessary to hold the position
9851.52 also you could contract as hard as
9854.28 possible pulling your scapula down and
9856.56 back squeezing your core squeezing your
9858.72 quads squeezing your glutes that is
9861.06 actually going to still help strength
9862.62 production because you're attempting to
9864.24 contract very very hard even though
9866.28 quote unquote the load is the same
9869.34 that thing extends to weight on the bar
9872.04 so you could theoretically see large
9874.859 improvements in strength at 50 of your
9878.22 100 max if you're Contracting as hard as
9881.22 possible and so there's a lot lots and
9884.28 lots of different ways you can train for
9886.5 strength that are outside of this weight
9888.42 lifting weight training spectrum and you
9891.84 know if people if you hear things like
9893.28 this and you're like wow I know I read
9895.2 this book or I saw this other coach who
9897.96 you know like I got so much stronger
9899.58 that way well if intention is there
9901.319 those are absolutely possible
9903.6 this could be anything from bodyweight
9906.3 style of training it could be very low
9908.7 load Implement stuff so a kettlebell a
9910.92 light kettlebell or a ball it could be
9913.26 single leg training it's like all kinds
9915.06 of different methods they will only work
9917.22 for strength though
9919.02 when you're past your first you know
9920.939 handful of months of training if
9922.859 intention is there and if it is then
9925.2 these specific numbers and protocols
9927.12 don't matter as much so don't get too
9928.859 caught up in them if you're not worrying
9931.26 about exercise quality and this is very
9934.02 very important because you mentioned
9935.939 earlier about how you stop taking your
9937.62 phone into the gym with you one of our
9940.62 former students Ramsay ninja is uh the
9943.38 head strength Edition coach at the
9944.7 University of Kansas and he made he made
9946.2 a great post a couple of days ago where
9948.12 he gave sort of a tip of how do I
9950.58 improve training quality and one of his
9952.8 tips is set your playlist before you go
9955.5 to the gym and the reason is people send
9957.6 spend so much time in between sets just
9959.76 finding the next song that they like it
9962.1 makes their workout so long and so
9964.68 unproductive so that is one strategy or
9967.26 do what you do which is Ditch the music
9969.24 entirely when you don't have music or a
9971.22 phone to look at
9972.479 you only have one job you only have one
9974.58 thing to pay attention to and what
9975.78 you'll find is the quality of the
9977.52 training will go up exponentially you
9980.399 will feel kind of quote unquote bored
9981.84 but that's just means you'll go back to
9983.34 training and you'll get a lot more done
9984.72 because you have one thing to focus on
9986.16 so you can get a lot more done when you
9988.56 avoid those distractions and when you're
9990.359 doing strength and especially power work
9993.0 since it's not fatiguing strength will
9995.939 be a little bit but Power won't be p get
9998.399 very bored they're used to either
10000.14 feeling a pump or a burn or a sweat or
10002.899 and that's their like perception of my
10005.06 quality of workout
10006.56 these exercises will not hit that for
10008.479 you so there has to be another metric
10010.34 you're looking at which is I'm going to
10012.62 try to move as well as I can as hard as
10015.439 I can that's going to produce your
10017.54 results if you can't do that then you
10019.58 might as well just not do these workouts
10020.84 go do something else you're just going
10022.58 to be wasting time you're going to be
10024.26 burning a very low amount of calories
10025.52 you'll have wasted an hour and you're
10028.1 going to go right back to the place you
10029.359 were so be very intentional
10031.66 there are actually some some studies
10034.1 showing that music can enhance
10035.3 performance we've done some of these in
10036.68 our lab so what's that mean it's not
10038.54 about the music per se it's about the
10039.979 focus and intent and do whatever it
10041.42 takes to be very focused and intent and
10043.399 you can actually get in and out very
10044.54 quickly and get a lot of work done and
10046.1 see a lot of results
10047.66 love it okay let's talk about
10049.64 hypertrophy
10051.62 a topic that occupies the minds of so
10054.8 many youth young men but also a lot of
10057.92 women I think one of the really
10059.72 interesting progressions that's taken
10061.22 place in the last decade or so is that
10064.16 far more men and women are using
10066.979 resistance training in order to evoke
10069.819 hypertrophy growth of muscles for
10072.38 aesthetic reasons and for all sorts of
10075.2 reasons
10076.52 what are the ways that people can induce
10079.1 hypertrophy so not to correct you or
10081.8 insult you but probably a better way to
10084.02 think about that question is really what
10086.479 stimuli do I need to give the muscle to
10089.359 induce hypertrophy now there are
10092.14 hormonal factors that are important
10094.16 there are nutritional factors but just
10095.84 to stick with the context of training
10097.66 this is really going to frame a lot of
10100.04 our answers and as you'll see it's one
10102.62 of the reasons why I call hypertrude
10104.78 training kind of idiot proof in terms of
10107.18 programming now the work is hard
10109.52 difficult and all that but the Precision
10112.28 needed is a lot less than what we saw in
10116.12 power and strength and so if you note
10118.399 there like it's very important that you
10119.66 do it in this style with this intent and
10122.0 with with these Within These parameters
10123.979 and if you're outside the parameters
10125.12 it's not going to be it hypertrophy has
10127.7 a very broad range in terms of your
10130.939 actual applications and this is why you
10133.7 have and will continue to see countless
10136.46 styles of training that all work I mean
10139.16 I know you were mentored earlier in life
10141.979 by one of my favorite people in this
10143.84 entire field Mike menser like just an
10145.819 absolute character his style was
10147.92 completely different than what you would
10149.66 see in a classic textbook
10151.96 or any number of different influencers
10156.68 or coaches or individuals and if you've
10159.26 ever thought thought to yourself like
10160.399 why is it all these programs work and
10162.439 people love to jump to things like well
10164.12 that's the steroids like just get that
10166.399 out of the equation for now
10167.78 independent of that right that's not
10169.399 even part of the equation you're still
10170.72 going to see results and the question is
10171.979 like why well that's because what's
10174.02 driving changes in strength and Power
10179.3 are the adaptations of specificity
10181.819 what's driving changes in hypertrophy is
10185.78 much more well-rounded and so you have
10187.22 options to get there remember you're
10189.62 training a movement and now you're
10191.6 training a response and a muscle that
10195.14 caused the growth that's very very
10196.28 different
10197.18 so if we look at like the classic Dogma
10200.0 we have to basically challenge the
10202.52 muscle to need to come back in this case
10205.16 specifically bigger and the nutrients
10207.02 need to be there to support that growth
10209.06 okay the nutrients aside perhaps we can
10211.16 come and a few more minutes and talk
10212.6 about that
10214.28 so all we really have to do is going
10216.38 back to our our dogma of activation of
10218.66 something on the cell wall we've talked
10220.46 about this earlier that's got to induce
10221.96 that signaling Cascade that's got to be
10224.06 strong enough to cause the nucleus to
10226.7 react to it to go to the ribosomes to
10229.1 initiate this entire Cascade of protein
10231.08 synthesis okay so that signal has to be
10233.06 one of a couple of things either has to
10235.16 be strong enough
10236.78 one time it has to be frequent enough
10240.439 or it has to be a combination of these
10243.02 things
10243.8 all right so I can get there with a lot
10246.38 of frequency and a moderate signal I can
10249.68 get there with very low frequency and a
10251.66 large signal like more akin to what you
10253.88 did with Mike back in the day I'm sure
10255.439 and still trained that way still
10257.12 training each muscle group mainly once a
10258.74 week directly and once a week indirectly
10262.46 so all you can all you have to do there
10264.319 to not fail is to make sure the training
10266.6 is hard enough
10267.5 and it's going to work if you choose the
10269.42 frequency path then you actually have to
10271.28 make sure you're not training too hard
10272.78 to where you can actually maintain the
10274.58 frequency the only wrong combination
10276.439 here is infrequent and low intensity and
10279.08 low volume that's it as long as one of
10281.479 those three variables is high you're
10283.58 going to get there because the
10284.96 mechanisms that are needed to activate
10287.0 that signaling Cascade are wide ranging
10289.16 and this is why when we even see things
10290.84 like Blood Flow Restriction Training
10293.479 right this is when you put like a cuff
10295.16 on your arm or your leg and you block
10296.6 blood flow and you use no load or as low
10299.42 as say 30 of your maximum and you take
10302.12 it to fatigue failure that actually is
10304.58 an equally effective way of inducing
10306.62 hypertrophy despite the fact that you
10308.78 know you're using three five ten maybe
10311.3 most 20 to 30 percent of your owner at
10313.7 Max why because you went through the
10315.56 route of metabolic disturbance okay
10317.779 other ways say a higher load maybe as
10321.26 heavy as you can for say eight
10322.58 repetitions is going to get through
10324.14 what's called mechanical tension and so
10326.96 there's there's these different paths
10328.16 that we can get to the same spot now
10329.24 eventually these things have a
10330.56 saturation point so you don't need all
10333.02 three of these mechanisms the third one
10334.88 of course being muscle damage or
10336.8 breakdown
10337.819 and I and I know we want to chat a
10339.74 little bit about that but none of these
10341.6 three are absolutely required you can
10343.7 have multiple of them in a session
10346.1 um you don't have to have breakdown at
10347.72 all that is a complete uh well really
10350.479 it's a flat out lie that you have to
10352.34 break a muscle down
10354.08 to cause it to grow that's just not
10355.819 needed at all you have to have one of
10357.74 these three things though and so again
10359.18 this allows you a lot of flexibility
10360.68 which is why crafting your program which
10363.319 is best for you
10364.7 is actually fairly simple when it comes
10367.1 to hypertrophy you just have to make
10368.3 sure you do the work and you want to
10370.399 make sure you have a few standards in
10372.08 place with the exercise choice and some
10374.24 other things that will
10375.74 um we'll hit in just a second but that's
10377.24 really the fundamental way of getting to
10378.92 it making sure either that signal is
10381.38 loud enough
10382.52 or frequent enough to give
10386.06 the nuclei a convincing enough reason to
10388.7 spend the resources because you have to
10390.2 remember two things in order to grow new
10392.6 skeletal muscle you need amino acids
10395.24 which are your supply and then you need
10397.58 primarily carbohydrates as the energy
10399.56 source to power that synthesis process
10401.54 so you remember basic chemistry that
10404.12 says if you're going to take two atoms
10405.8 and you're going to pull them apart or
10407.779 put them together right that's going to
10409.46 take energy typically and in most of
10411.8 actually metabolism
10413.779 uh when you split a bond you're going to
10415.7 get it's called exergonic you're going
10416.96 to get energy from that but when you put
10418.52 them together
10419.779 that's going to take energy this is why
10421.58 we call that protein synthesis right so
10424.1 you have to convince your nucleus that
10426.62 one invest those resources in energy
10428.66 primarily carbohydrate but number two
10430.64 and more importantly invest that Supply
10433.06 there's a ton of possible ways to get
10435.56 energy but there's a very low amount of
10437.24 amino acids available and you need them
10438.92 for many more things than just taking
10441.319 your biceps from 17 inches to 18 inches
10444.26 right it's not going to do that if
10446.899 you're in a position where again you
10448.34 can't sustain an immune function if red
10450.38 blood cell turnover needs to be higher
10452.0 or any of the other main like tons of
10453.92 things that you need proteins for so you
10456.62 have to be able to say like are you sure
10458.0 you really want to spend these resources
10459.979 and build it in a muscle because once we
10461.899 do that it's very difficult to go
10464.24 backwards break them back down and bring
10466.76 the amino acids back into the to that
10468.5 availability pool so we can use them for
10470.54 either another function entirely or even
10473.3 another muscle group that's called
10475.7 protein redistribution by the way when
10477.56 you say maybe you don't do
10480.859 um a lot of upper body work in your
10482.3 training and you're not eating enough
10484.04 protein or a minimal amount and you're
10485.899 doing a lot of lifting in your legs
10487.1 you'll you'll notice your legs will get
10488.96 larger but that's actually a lot of
10490.7 times you're pulling the protein from
10492.56 say your upper body in this case and
10494.3 redistributing it back down
10496.46 um to the quads so that's the way you
10498.859 that's what you have to get to and in
10500.779 terms of application what numbers to hit
10502.58 we can go through each one of our
10503.84 modifiable variables just like we did
10506.18 with speed and strength and power and
10509.18 walk through some of our best practices
10510.8 in each category yes so I'd love to talk
10513.439 about those modifiable variables as they
10516.14 relate to
10517.76 choice
10519.14 of movements order of movements
10522.8 volume so sets and repetitions and
10526.64 frequency of training and I'm
10528.38 particularly interested in frequency of
10529.76 training because that relates to the
10531.02 so-called split where
10533.72 typically one is not training their
10536.24 whole body every workout although there
10538.22 are I'm sure hypertrophy workouts that
10540.56 um our whole body workouts but where
10542.18 people are dividing on their body parts
10544.7 on onto different days
10546.979 so uh
10548.66 would love to go through this list one
10550.279 by one starting with exercise Choice
10552.8 cool great so in the previous section we
10555.439 pretty much said exclusively choose your
10557.42 exercises by the movement patterns and
10559.1 you want to balance between pushing and
10560.6 pulling and rotation and things like
10562.52 that in this particular case you have
10564.02 the option to do either here's my
10566.0 recommendation most people default
10567.92 almost exclusively to Choosing by body
10569.899 parts here right I'm going to do calves
10573.08 and shoulders today and chest and back
10576.08 whatever combinations of things they
10577.76 want that is clearly effective strategy
10579.979 however many Studies have actually been
10582.8 done where you choose by movement
10584.359 patterns and that is actually equally
10585.979 effective
10587.24 now one little caveat I actually should
10589.279 have said a few minutes ago when we talk
10591.08 about the research on muscle hypertrophy
10592.939 it is important to distinguish the fact
10595.399 that the vast majority of This research
10596.84 is coming from a novice to moderately
10599.54 trained individuals there's actually
10600.68 more and more research coming out on
10602.24 trained individuals but that's still
10604.939 moderately trained right even those ones
10607.34 so what happens in those people that are
10609.14 actually way past that point we don't
10611.6 know scientifically it's very difficult
10613.04 to do research there so that's an
10614.72 important caveat I will acknowledge when
10616.939 I say hey you don't need to do this or
10618.74 you have to do this you're assuming a
10621.14 training status of moderate to low may
10625.16 or may not be true past that we don't
10626.96 know scientifically I have certain
10628.16 thoughts personally but the science will
10630.439 only take us that far so
10632.12 that being said you can actually choose
10634.399 by muscle or by movement pattern here
10637.46 whichever is is your personal preference
10639.26 and this is actually where you can act
10640.88 just become a good coach whether you're
10642.5 coaching somebody else through this
10643.7 fitness journey or it's yourself and
10645.859 give them a little bit of autonomy so
10647.72 maybe you select the first three
10649.22 exercises and then let them select one
10651.02 every day and so if they especially want
10653.84 to make sure that one muscle group grows
10656.12 let them Target that muscle and maybe
10658.16 the rest of the day you've actually
10659.359 split it up as Push Pull or something
10661.88 else like that all those strategies are
10664.22 effective personal preference as long as
10666.02 the total amount of volume on the
10667.34 working muscle is equated throughout the
10669.56 week which we'll get to those numbers in
10671.18 a second then you're going to be in the
10672.62 exact same spot no problem I would
10674.96 actually generally encourage
10677.06 people to choose exercises in a variety
10680.12 of Fashions I actually think that it's
10681.74 important that you do some number of
10684.74 combination of what we call bilateral
10686.359 and unilateral exercises so bilateral
10689.479 being think about it like a squat where
10691.04 bi meaning two lateral you have two feet
10693.439 on the ground moving in sequence here
10696.14 unilateral is one so this could be
10698.3 something as simple as a rear foot a
10701.359 limited split squat it could be a single
10703.1 leg leg press or single leg curl it
10705.02 could be a pistol squat something where
10706.939 the the individual limb is moving one at
10709.88 a time you need to have a combination of
10711.5 bilateral and unilateral trading that's
10714.14 good to do for strength as well probably
10715.819 not super important for power but I'm
10718.52 also very important for making sure
10721.64 for hypertrophy's sake you're not
10723.08 getting any imbalances
10724.96 as you progress especially through
10727.04 months and years of training so make
10729.319 sure you're doing a little bit of a
10730.279 combination whether you want to pick
10732.14 specific implements that's really a
10734.06 methods question and a preference
10736.22 question then it is Concepts so dumbbell
10739.819 great kettlebell fine barbell awesome
10742.34 band doesn't matter body weight none of
10744.979 these things are as important because
10747.02 all you're trying to do is create a
10748.58 certain insult in the tissue and the
10750.2 Implement is just whichever one you feel
10752.06 best doing it and this is where actually
10754.779 machines come into play a lot machines
10757.399 are greatly underappreciated they are a
10760.1 fantastic resource especially somebody
10762.399 who's either early in their fitness
10764.84 journey
10765.859 or somebody who really is having a hard
10768.439 time targeting a muscle group with a
10770.96 bigger compound movement
10772.52 so when you're choosing exercises for
10774.02 hypertrophy you're going to want to
10775.819 start with those bigger compound
10777.38 movements that's going to be drive a lot
10779.6 of the adaptation you can get to these
10781.64 single joint movements like a little bit
10783.74 later but having said that
10785.72 because of of the way that people move
10788.779 differently their bomb or their
10790.279 anthropometrics and their biomechanics
10792.2 and even their technique the same exact
10794.54 exercise
10795.979 will not necessarily work the same exact
10799.04 muscle groups for multiple people so if
10801.02 you and I both went and did a back squat
10804.02 um if you did a little bit more of what
10805.76 we call a high bar squat so this is the
10807.979 bar is literally sitting up higher up on
10809.479 your neck you're keeping your back more
10811.939 vertical and because in order to do that
10814.7 you shift your knees much further past
10817.04 your toes keeping of course your whole
10818.84 foot on the ground in good position okay
10820.64 that's going to generally put more of an
10823.819 emphasis on the knee joint right and so
10826.279 that's not a bad thing you tend to see a
10828.8 little bit more work in the quads there
10830.359 a little bit less work in the spinal
10832.46 rectus and back because you're actually
10834.08 not supporting the weight horizontally
10837.14 which is a diff it's a much more
10838.7 difficult position it's vertically
10840.2 stacked okay
10842.12 if I were doing the classic low bar
10844.16 squat which is again lowering the bar
10845.779 down my further down my back towards uh
10847.76 one more like my shoulder blades I
10849.56 probably take a little bit of a wider
10850.819 stance and when I squat I drive my
10853.22 glutes back further away from the
10855.08 midline in as in fact as a general rule
10857.479 if you take the midline of your body the
10860.06 thing that moves is the farthest away
10861.439 from that midline is likely to be the
10863.3 thing that's activating the most
10865.16 so in the case of the of the front squat
10867.08 you're not generally going to be using
10869.06 your glutes as much if you're in that
10871.399 are not even front side just that high
10872.66 bar squat where you're very very
10873.68 vertical your knees are going to be
10875.0 moving very far over your toes which is
10876.56 fantastic therefore it's a little bit
10878.42 more knee dominant as can we say it the
10880.34 other version here you can keep your
10881.66 shins really close to Vertical you move
10883.34 your butt backwards
10885.26 you're going to have to then lean
10886.7 forward with your torso which means
10888.68 it'll be more low back more glutes and a
10890.66 little bit less knee now that's a
10892.399 general statement it's not necessarily
10893.84 always true but as a guideline there
10896.06 that is one exact exercise where you may
10898.04 be going man I'm trying to improve this
10901.1 clear weakness I have in my quads I
10903.319 can't even leg extension my body weight
10904.939 I have a significant problem there so
10907.22 maybe in your particular case if I'm
10909.5 hammering you or you're hammering
10910.819 yourself in a squad exercise and you're
10912.439 wondering why your quads aren't getting
10913.88 any stronger or growing in any size it
10917.12 may be because of the style of the
10918.8 movement so I may need to go Andrew all
10920.42 right look squats in general if you look
10923.3 at the research are an excellent
10924.56 exercise for Quad development but for
10926.3 you they're not because of the way you
10928.34 stand or just because of you know neural
10930.979 activation it doesn't matter so I need
10932.54 to take you to a machine and isolate
10934.64 that muscle group so we can make sure we
10936.2 see development in that so if you're
10938.3 trying to grow a specific body part area
10941.12 individual muscle it's very important
10943.399 that you're actually seeing progress
10944.72 there and don't worry about well in the
10947.3 textbook the bench press is supposed to
10948.979 be good for your PEC because if you're
10950.779 not actually moving the right position
10951.8 or depends on the angle in which your
10953.42 sternum actually sits in your body a
10955.939 bench press may actually be doing very
10957.56 little for your PEC and you may need to
10959.479 adjust to say an incline bench or a
10961.1 decline bench or a PEC fly so machines
10963.8 can be fantastic at letting you isolate
10966.02 without having to worry about things
10967.46 like stability your low back position
10970.16 getting hurt where's your neck at you
10972.08 can really concentrate on just the
10973.64 movement concentrate on the muscle and
10976.279 let everything else kind of go away and
10977.779 ensure you're getting training in that
10979.819 specific area those are excellent
10981.859 recommendations one thing I want to ask
10983.54 about is prioritizing specific body
10986.779 parts and therefore specific exercises
10990.2 and here I'm not necessarily referring
10992.24 to trying to bring up a so-called weak
10994.76 body part you know an area that tends to
10997.52 be either genetically deficient because
10999.439 in some cases I learned for instance
11002.38 having seen a lot of competitive track
11004.24 and field championships I love watching
11006.7 track and field as a spectator up to
11008.26 Hayward Field in Oregon whenever there's
11009.64 a meat oh sure I really love that the
11012.22 sprinters are amazing
11014.2 um they have some of the highest calves
11015.939 in the world that I've ever seen I mean
11017.62 like little like little micro Cavs but
11020.38 they're fast as hell they're right
11023.02 behind the knee and they have a very
11024.279 long distance between that calf and
11025.96 their foot which makes it propulsion
11027.7 excellent right they wouldn't stand a
11029.439 chance as a competitive bodybuilder but
11031.66 because something different is being
11033.58 selected for in bodybuilding but
11035.2 obviously they're they're magnificent
11037.6 for sprinting most people of course
11039.52 reside somewhere between the extreme of
11041.68 you know very long muscle bellies from
11043.96 you know origin to insertion or very
11046.72 very short muscles usually people have
11048.819 one or two body parts parts that they
11050.859 want to emphasize for whatever reason
11052.42 you know these days it seems to be
11053.979 people are really what are they saying
11056.14 now like glutes to the new biceps or
11057.819 biceps are the new glutes or I don't
11059.5 know anyway you see this stuff I love
11061.12 them by the way I am so Pro curls in the
11064.359 squat rack there you go love it right
11066.34 there you go so nobody kill me so
11068.38 everyone has their thing but the that
11070.479 they would like to emphasize but I have
11072.22 a question because we're specifically
11073.54 talking about hypertrophy which is
11077.02 should people give themselves permission
11079.0 to not train a body part if their goal
11082.42 is balanced hypertrophy I'll give a
11084.939 couple of examples one of the reasons
11086.68 why I for instance not done a lot of
11089.5 free weight squatting is because despite
11092.68 my quadriceps being rather weak
11094.54 according to you
11095.859 um they tend to grow rather easily
11098.14 relative to other muscle groups and the
11100.42 goal for me has always been balanced
11101.979 development yeah and so I emphasize
11104.14 hamstring work and I emphasize a you
11106.42 know calf work and hamstring work
11108.58 um it's not that I don't train my quads
11109.96 at all but I do far less for them and I
11112.6 avoid the big compound movements for
11114.7 them I I occasionally do them and what
11117.52 again this is not about what I do or
11118.96 don't do but I think that in the context
11121.899 of a conversation about hypertrophy is
11124.18 it appropriate to give people permission
11125.68 to say listen if you're just genetically
11127.72 you know strong large lats
11130.899 doing a lot of chin-ups and rows might
11133.06 actually be the worst thing for you if
11134.62 your goal is balanced development and I
11136.899 um I ask because I don't often hear
11138.42 anyone any you know credentialed people
11142.96 give people permission to completely
11145.96 avoid training a given body part if
11148.12 their goal is balanced development and
11150.399 yet I think most people who are
11152.2 resistance training are seeking balance
11154.6 development I don't know anybody that
11156.76 actively wants to have big upper body
11158.62 small legs I think that comes from
11160.0 neglect and laziness in most cases
11161.979 sometimes injury related or other things
11163.779 but
11165.7 um I think this is an important point to
11166.96 raise that any good program for
11168.88 hypertrophy I would think would have to
11171.1 take into account people's genetic and
11173.14 natural variation
11174.76 um sport based variation in which muscle
11177.04 groups just tend to grow easily for them
11178.84 and which ones require a lot more focus
11181.18 and work yeah absolutely you first of
11184.0 all you have permission to do or not do
11186.279 anything you'd like to do in terms of of
11188.56 hybrid tree I generally wouldn't not
11191.439 recommend disregarding a muscle group
11193.3 entirely I know that's not what you
11194.74 actually suggested but just to make sure
11196.12 that people didn't hear it that way
11198.46 um what I would do is in this example is
11200.38 I would continue to do those big
11201.58 movements I would just keep the volume
11202.72 low so I might do two sets or something
11206.08 uh twice a week there's a whole bunch of
11208.66 reasons you want to make sure that those
11209.8 motor patterns are there you want to
11212.38 make sure that the the especially the
11214.24 benefit of these compound movements is
11216.04 you get to work so many complementary
11218.979 muscle movements at the same time so in
11220.72 the case of like loaded squat you're not
11222.76 only working stability in the hip as
11225.46 well as the knee but you're also working
11226.96 upper body uh your your rhomboids are
11229.66 keeping you in position your neck has to
11231.1 stay in position your toes everything is
11233.02 working and so it's really difficult to
11234.64 get those things when you take that
11237.58 movement out and you replace it with say
11239.2 a a machine hamstring curl that whole
11242.859 element of balance and neurological
11244.42 control is very very important to
11246.399 maintain over time and that just gets
11249.04 removed with if you go to machines only
11251.08 so I would keep some of those things in
11253.779 maybe even not all year round but maybe
11255.46 one quarter of the year two quarters
11257.08 every other rotate it something like
11258.399 that as long as it's getting you're not
11260.8 if the reason you weren't doing say
11262.54 those squats was uh because you're like
11264.7 ah it hurts my backers okay great then
11266.2 leave it out but if it's just simple you
11267.52 don't want your quads to go too much I
11268.84 would just keep that volume low and do
11271.0 something just to kind of touch it keep
11272.38 it activated and to maintain all those
11274.899 other things like flexibility range of
11277.54 motion I would bet anything your
11279.399 adductors are probably underdeveloped
11281.56 right now you can get those by doing
11283.18 your squats because you're not really
11284.26 doing I'm sure in much adduction
11286.18 training and so this things like that
11288.279 that just get lost when you're only
11290.08 thinking all big muscle groups that that
11292.66 come inherent in doing the larger
11294.939 movements and so you don't have to worry
11296.2 about them or train them separately I
11298.12 appreciate that and in reality I do two
11301.359 to three really hard work sets of hack
11304.24 hack machine squats per week which is
11306.7 plenty for me to maintain and even get a
11308.56 Little Bit Stronger but per our earlier
11311.14 discussion about a year ago I shifted to
11313.96 doing very low repetition ranges to main
11316.42 strength in that movement there you go
11317.92 but I am actively avoiding hypertrophy
11320.26 in that muscle group yeah or another
11322.3 solution would actually be do something
11323.8 like one set to failure a week
11326.38 not even extremely long just you know do
11328.66 something in the 8 to 15 repetition
11330.34 range
11331.54 um at the end of all that strength set
11333.16 and just get a little bit of pump there
11334.66 and then and then just so just so that
11336.64 those muscles can touch that level of
11338.2 fatigue touch that level of strain and
11339.88 mechanical tension walk away
11342.16 great thank you for that
11343.96 what about exercise order amazing so
11347.939 implicit in this exercise Choice thing
11350.26 it's what you're going to notice is
11352.0 these modifiable variables interact with
11353.979 each other right and you can clearly see
11355.66 how when we talked about volume and to
11357.819 clarify volume is the repetitions
11359.56 multiplied by the sets that's typically
11361.12 how we express the volume well that's
11362.68 going to be directly influenced by
11363.76 intensity the heavier load you put on
11366.16 the barbell the less repetitions you can
11367.899 do and the inverse right rest intervals
11370.6 the shorter you keep your rest intervals
11372.279 then either the lower the weight has to
11373.779 go the intensity or the lower the rep
11375.279 range has to go order is the same thing
11377.439 choice is the same thing so all of these
11379.66 things modify each other they play a
11381.52 little bit of a hand and what everything
11382.899 else does so with the exercise Choice
11385.66 thing rolling into exercise order you
11387.7 get to play a couple of games here when
11389.439 we talked about strength and power I
11391.0 basically said stick to the big
11392.56 movements most complicated and compound
11394.72 movements first you don't have to do
11396.7 that with hypertrophy you can do this in
11399.16 a couple of ways you can do the thing
11400.96 you're just simply most interested in
11402.46 first you can do this thing called
11404.62 pre-fatigue so say you're you're going
11407.26 to do a back day you could go in and do
11408.939 nothing but isolated biceps as your very
11411.22 first exercise and then roll into your
11414.819 your pulling movements because what
11416.08 you'll see is during most pulling
11417.46 activities the biceps are a secondary or
11419.26 tertiary muscle group but you've
11421.06 pre-fatigued them you've guaranteed that
11422.5 muscle of most interest God it's it's
11424.42 most training in and everything else is
11426.52 secondary so you can start if you want
11428.5 with single joint movements you can
11430.12 start with isolation stuff or you can
11431.8 start with compound stuff either way it
11434.38 just really comes down to preference and
11435.7 what you're specifically trying to
11437.8 develop now this also goes back to the
11440.979 exercise Choice question right because
11442.479 it's sort of the same thing right like
11444.04 what which one am I choosing
11446.02 and where I wanted it the campus was the
11449.14 exercise splits and and so we just sort
11451.899 of talked about am I doing body part
11453.16 splits and I know a question I get a lot
11454.96 here is well which ones should I package
11456.52 together
11457.54 I'm not really concerned with it what
11459.399 you all you should worry about is how
11461.5 many times per week and in fact total
11463.54 volume you achieve on a muscle group
11465.939 per week and I don't doesn't really
11468.04 matter how those things are folded in
11470.2 it's really a personal preference issue
11472.439 one mistake that we see here commonly
11475.359 is grossly under appreciating that the
11478.84 legs are not a muscle group
11481.359 right so the legs have a whole bunch of
11484.3 muscle groups in them so we see a
11486.04 classic split like I'll Do shoulders and
11488.68 chest Monday and then I'll do you know
11492.0 biceps and forearms Tuesday and then
11495.58 legs Wednesday
11497.08 or whatever and then back to upper body
11499.12 and then I was like you're like wait a
11500.38 minute
11501.1 you have four days dedicated to the
11503.14 upper body and one for quote-unquote
11504.88 legs
11506.38 well like you hopefully you can see the
11508.54 imbalance what's that's going to happen
11509.859 there over time is you're going to do it
11511.779 do far more upper body than you are
11513.46 lower body and that's not appropriate so
11515.26 you just want to think about your lower
11516.46 body like you would do if you're going
11518.2 to do body part splits then include
11519.819 those things as well and they'll just
11521.2 chunk everything in as legs once a week
11523.359 if you want to do that that's actually
11525.04 okay but that day has to be very very
11527.38 challenging and you probably should do
11528.88 quite a bit of volume
11530.62 um there because you're almost surely
11532.0 not going to hit the total weekly volume
11533.439 needed to optimize muscle growth if
11536.14 you're literally only doing once a week
11537.819 of your quote-unquote legs so along
11541.0 those lines Let's Talk Volume yep how
11543.88 much volume does each muscle group need
11546.16 per week in order to generate and for
11550.3 that matter maintain hypertrophy right
11552.279 so the kind of a minimum number we're
11554.319 going to look for here is 10 working
11555.819 sets per week correct per muscle group
11558.7 correct and just to make sure that
11561.399 everyone's on the same page if I do a
11564.279 chin up or a pull-up
11566.68 I'm going to mainly be training my back
11569.8 muscles my lats if I'm doing it
11572.2 correctly lats and rhomboids and biceps
11573.939 right and a few so but they'll be
11575.62 indirect targeting of the biceps so
11578.68 would you include indirect
11581.02 targeting so for instance if I you said
11583.899 10 sets per week let's just use biceps
11585.76 because it seems that that's the go-to
11587.319 uh generic muscle for what why is that
11590.2 by the way that when people ask somebody
11591.46 to you know Flex their muscle they
11593.2 always Flex their bicep they don't flex
11594.399 their calf or their quad or their glutes
11596.38 or something I guess there's some um you
11598.0 know public decency issues I can tell
11599.8 you uh with my children that's the very
11602.26 first muscle I taught them to flex their
11603.7 glutes no they're biceps
11607.42 and and good
11609.939 um good uh healthy parenting advice from
11612.52 Dr Andy Galpin so if it's 10 sets per
11614.92 week
11616.12 for biceps in order to maintain or
11618.7 further grow the biceps
11620.68 but does that mean if somebody does 10
11623.439 sets of chin-ups or 10 sets of chin ups
11626.26 and rows that they are checking off any
11628.06 of the boxes for biceps assuming that
11630.52 they're doing the movement properly yeah
11632.26 and targeting the major muscle group
11634.96 that a given movement is supposed to
11636.819 Target which in my mind when you're
11638.979 doing a chin up you're supposed to
11640.779 mainly be using your back muscles and
11642.76 then there are secondary muscles or
11644.859 secondary activation of other muscles
11647.38 but of course some people their arms
11649.479 grow like crazy when they do chin ups
11651.399 and their back doesn't grow at all so
11652.479 this is where we're back to the kind of
11654.399 um genetic preloading of the system yep
11657.64 um if you will so how does one meet this
11660.64 10 sets per week minimum when dividing
11664.24 different body parts and thinking about
11665.62 this
11666.76 direct and indirect Activation so two
11668.859 things there's no specific exact rule
11671.02 here and this is why these set ranges
11672.88 are ranges right and this is why we
11675.52 don't say like 10 is so 10 would be sort
11677.26 of the minimum number you want to get to
11678.7 the more realistic number that most
11680.92 people especially if you're Advanced or
11683.08 even intermediate is more like 15 to 20
11685.779 working sets per week okay now if you're
11688.66 very well trained you probably want to
11690.16 even push more towards like 25 and in
11692.14 fact past that
11694.359 there's just not a lot of research so
11696.34 the optimal number may be 30. we don't
11697.96 we don't really know it's just hard to
11699.34 get that much work in um it may actually
11701.5 be detrimental and here we're referring
11703.3 to Natural athletes that is people who
11706.479 for whatever reason either because
11708.52 they're not taking any prescription
11710.08 drugs or maybe if they are whose levels
11713.5 of
11714.64 steroid hormones
11716.319 mainly the androgens like testosterone
11718.42 Etc
11719.74 do not exceed the normal reference range
11722.02 values either because that's what they
11723.939 are naturally or that's what they're
11725.14 replacing through pharmacology whereas
11727.24 when we think of
11729.34 technically someone could be taking
11730.96 exogenous hormones to replace a
11733.6 deficiency and then there's still a
11735.04 normal range okay but I just want to
11737.2 clarify because you work with athletes a
11740.02 number of different sports where drugs
11741.52 are and are not tolerated Etc and the
11743.62 general population that what we are
11745.54 talking about here is for the general
11746.92 population not for steroid using
11748.899 athletes correct okay yeah great so
11751.6 um so Ken was just sort of that like
11753.46 absolute minimum number to maintain
11754.96 which is actually pretty cool if you
11756.279 think about it this way uh if you went
11758.5 in and you did three sets of ten
11761.2 it's a very three sets of ten
11762.76 repetitions correct
11764.26 you're already at three you do that
11765.819 three days a week
11767.14 you're at your nine that's almost ten if
11769.18 you also just went to the gym one day a
11771.04 week you did three sets of ten and you
11773.14 did three exercises
11775.24 you're at nine is that working sets
11776.74 you're basically done so achieving 10
11778.899 sets per week per muscle group and now
11781.0 we're not even talking about indirect
11782.5 activation of a secondary so you're
11784.84 going to hit 10 fairly easy
11788.319 um extension to that hitting 20 is
11790.54 actually still not that hard because of
11792.7 what's actually going to happen there so
11794.14 in your example if you're doing your
11795.34 chin UPS well
11797.38 would the biceps count there's no exact
11800.26 rule there because uh there could be
11802.3 technique issues it could be hand
11803.859 positions so you mentioned chin up very
11805.42 specifically a chin up is actually going
11807.04 to put your hands in in this position
11808.72 where your palms are facing up right
11810.22 this is supination and pronation so
11811.66 you're gonna be there well that's
11813.04 actually quite different than a pull-up
11814.479 or your hands are in the opposite
11816.22 direction so a chin up actually is going
11818.92 to be pretty good activator in your
11820.3 biceps
11821.14 for most people
11822.52 um so you would expect actually to
11824.08 probably count that because it's going
11825.76 to be very difficult to not see some
11827.26 fatigue in your biceps depending on your
11829.96 mechanics depending on and by that I
11832.3 mean just the the segment lengths of
11835.479 your bones right that's where your
11837.399 muscles or originate and insert there's
11839.5 been something you can do about it's not
11840.58 even a technique or a focus issue it's
11842.14 just simple fact the matter that's how
11843.819 you pull best in that area the position
11846.399 in which your hands are on the wider
11849.16 grip more narrow grip it's going to
11850.6 change muscle use so we talked about
11853.2 earlier I think in the previous episode
11855.819 that exercises do not determine
11858.16 adaptations applications do but
11859.84 exercises do determine things like the
11862.06 movement plane The Joint you use and
11865.12 typically The Eccentric concentric sort
11867.58 of ratio as well as oftentimes the
11869.74 muscle groups involved so there's just
11873.22 not a lot of things you can do depending
11874.779 on how you are built of you know some
11877.18 exercises activating a secondary group
11879.46 and you don't want it so it's not always
11880.54 a technique you it may just be that's
11882.64 how you're built right and the same
11884.74 could be true for a squat the high bar
11887.92 versus low bar sort of example we talked
11889.72 about earlier it's you know you you
11891.64 could see plenty of evidence on muscle
11894.52 activation studies where people even
11896.859 doing the vertical back squat style have
11899.38 tremendous glute activation and folks
11901.3 doing the the low bar have tremendous
11903.88 quad Activation so a lot of it depends
11906.34 on personal mechanics so what I counted
11908.319 is the question really you just have to
11909.76 ask yourself number one
11911.74 do you really care that much you know
11914.02 you have a range to get to if you're
11915.7 anywhere between 10 to 25 working sets
11918.04 you know you're fine so if you count it
11920.56 or don't count it it's just going to
11921.64 change the difference between whether
11922.479 you did 17 working sets or 23 and either
11924.76 way you're fine so I don't really care
11926.74 number two are you actually feeling
11928.96 anything there so if you're doing your
11930.88 chin ups and your biceps are blowing up
11933.16 I'm counting that right if you're doing
11935.02 it you're like no I don't feel any
11936.04 fatigue there it's all my then I'd
11937.899 probably say okay we're not going to
11938.74 count that as towards it so um you can
11940.72 just let that guide you a little bit
11942.22 towards your account yeah I've always
11944.62 noticed that there are certain muscle
11946.54 groups that are very easy to isolate
11950.14 yeah when under load and those are
11952.84 almost always the same muscle groups
11955.359 that are easy to
11957.52 contract very hard without any load
11960.64 whatsoever Bingo you know that's
11962.62 actually really insightful so
11964.779 um you can kind of use this heuristic of
11966.46 like if you can contract your lats just
11968.68 standing here you're probably going to
11970.6 contract them very well when you lift if
11972.279 you can't you can probably assume about
11974.5 the same thing's going to happen so uh
11976.84 yeah you'll know
11978.52 um this is actually the lats are
11979.66 actually really interesting because they
11982.12 tend to be one of the more difficult
11983.319 muscle groups to learn how to activate
11985.24 so if you're in your journey you're just
11987.34 like I have no idea and um you can look
11989.68 up like a lat pose so how do you like
11992.26 how do you puff your last how do you
11993.52 show it and if you do that and you're
11994.899 like wow there's no movement here
11997.24 just recognize that's extremely common
11999.279 and that is probably going to take you
12001.319 many many many months of trying before
12003.66 you start to see some movements and
12005.04 probably even a few years before you
12006.479 really start to see Activation so you're
12008.399 not some sort of like specific like
12010.14 special genetic anomaly it's very very
12013.08 common it's uncommon to not be able to
12015.6 activate your biceps
12017.16 right that everyone can do that but if
12018.72 you're just like man
12020.22 I can't get this here I'm just going to
12021.84 stop doing it do not do that just keep
12023.819 at it and just keep concentrating and
12025.74 thinking about that muscle group it will
12027.24 take some time it's very common to have
12029.52 challenges activating Lots yeah I've
12032.399 noticed that many of the muscle groups
12034.979 that were responsible for a large
12037.26 fraction of the work in the various
12039.3 sports that I played as a young child
12041.84 are muscles that are very easy for me to
12045.899 selectively isolate and induce
12047.7 hypertrophy in um I suppose I'm one of
12050.1 those mutants where my lats happen to be
12051.899 one such of those muscle groups but I
12054.359 think that's because I swam a lot when I
12055.92 was a kid literally going to ask me a
12057.66 swimmer yeah that's like a Telltale yeah
12059.22 every every kid in my town swam and
12060.899 played soccer there you go and then
12062.58 later I you know I skateboarded and did
12065.819 something you generally hear that
12066.84 answers you either were a swimmer or
12069.24 you're a wrestler
12070.5 so it's like that pulling and pull
12071.819 toward you is
12073.16 thousands of repetitions allowed you to
12075.66 get very good at Contracting but because
12078.42 um I also played soccer and
12080.04 skateboarding but I didn't do any
12081.96 baseball basketball or football muscle
12084.24 groups like deltoids are very
12086.1 challenging to activate nicely yeah so I
12088.439 do think that early development is
12090.3 superimposed on a genetic template that
12093.359 sort of predicts which muscle groups are
12095.58 going to be easier or harder to isolate
12097.26 and train it's also a very good case for
12099.3 why it's important to do as many
12101.52 different athletic activities as you can
12103.859 in your youth yeah and if you do
12105.72 skateboard
12106.8 definitely learn to ride switch because
12108.979 every every skateboarder I know has one
12111.479 leg that's larger than the other one
12112.859 calf that's larger than the other and
12114.779 actually for that matter um people that
12116.34 do martial arts that don't learn to um
12118.2 if they're not Southpaw if they don't
12119.819 learn to switch up and do their uh their
12121.92 work Southpaw you see the same thing I
12123.66 mean you're building an asymmetry into
12125.16 the system and it's not just muscular
12127.38 it's neural oh strongly neural yeah um
12130.8 so yeah kids
12132.3 um parents get your kids doing a bunch
12134.819 of different things I suppose gymnastics
12136.5 would probably be the best sport all
12138.3 around in terms of movement in multiple
12140.52 planes and activating all the different
12141.96 muscle groups uh yes and no there's a
12145.5 lot of benefit no question about it
12147.84 there's a lot of other things though
12149.16 that it that has limited abilities so
12151.62 um almost everything in not like gyms is
12153.66 great but almost everything in that is
12155.1 pre-planned which is a major downfall
12157.56 right so the joy of skating is there's
12159.84 so much proprioceptive input that you
12161.58 have to make decisions very quickly
12163.92 um in in small Windows now you have a
12165.479 little bit of that when you're flipping
12166.319 in the air you have to land but you
12167.76 gymnastics gymnasts tend to have a very
12169.8 specific routine that they're working on
12171.06 and they work on that routine for years
12172.68 so
12174.359 um for me was Transportation it was
12176.819 freedom and it didn't require any
12178.319 coaches or parental oversight yeah yeah
12180.359 Ball Sports have the beauty of reaction
12182.16 and things like that so all of them are
12183.84 wonderful
12185.279 um yeah good to do a lot of them you've
12188.1 established that 10 really to 20 sets
12190.739 per week yeah is the kind of bounds for
12194.76 um maintaining and initiating hypertri
12197.52 yep if I were to like flag one of them I
12199.979 would say 15 to 20. is this that's right
12202.02 that you want to get um working now
12204.3 it gets complicated when you ask well
12206.52 how many reps per set
12208.56 do I have to get to okay well
12211.14 we also can complicate that by
12212.819 repetition type and tempo just sort of
12216.06 let all that go for now and just think
12217.56 if you're getting close to that range
12220.2 you're in the spot and all you have to
12222.779 do now is balance two things
12224.939 recovery and continued training okay so
12227.76 if you're somewhere in this 10 to 20
12229.2 working sets range and you're in a
12232.56 position where you can continue to do
12233.939 that you're not so sore and so damaged
12236.46 and beat up that you can't maintain that
12238.8 volume for you know eight weeks at a
12240.899 time or at least six weeks at a time
12242.46 then I'd probably say either the style
12244.859 of repetitions the amount of repetitions
12246.66 per set you're doing are too much the
12248.22 volume is getting to you however if
12250.08 you're not seeing adaptations then I'd
12252.18 say maybe the repetitions aren't enough
12253.62 and so that's like that's the kind of
12255.84 game you're running now there could be
12257.1 plenty of other factors intensity of
12259.62 course yeah intensity
12261.96 um intent and then of course the other
12264.18 things sleep nutrition
12266.58 Etc all these other things that go into
12268.56 our visible stressor category that we
12270.84 always analyze this sort of brings up
12273.06 this idea of responders and
12274.2 non-responders so we get this one a ton
12276.6 so why is it some people my gym buddy my
12280.56 roommate we go to sleep the same time
12282.06 we're on the same nutrition plan we work
12283.979 out together she triples in muscle size
12286.5 and I don't have like no again
12288.359 whatsoever well there's a lot of work
12290.88 that we're trying to do to identify the
12292.2 molecular mechanisms behind responders
12294.779 and non-responders because they clearly
12296.16 exist in fact this is one of the reasons
12297.72 why every paper I basically will ever
12300.42 publish again if I you know if I do
12302.279 always reports individual person data so
12305.939 rather than group averages you get to
12307.56 see you know if there's 10 subjects in
12308.88 it you get to see how each of the ten
12310.38 responded because the group average can
12312.84 get confusing what you really want to
12315.239 see is how many actually people got
12317.46 better how many got worse how many maybe
12320.04 change you know so so we'll always
12322.02 report those individual data because
12323.359 when you go to train you're you you're
12325.979 not the group average that's very
12327.479 important to know
12328.68 all right so if you do that you can see
12330.84 a beautiful line of these hyper
12332.819 responders the bell curve in the middle
12334.979 of the normal responders and those folks
12336.54 who like through any training study just
12338.64 won't get any better if you can tease
12341.279 out what you can't but let's say in
12342.6 science you could tease out all the
12343.92 extra factors total stress load
12345.72 hydration sleep
12347.34 Etc what you often see is non-responders
12350.22 a lot of the time it's not that they
12352.08 have a physiological inability it's just
12353.939 that they need a different protocol and
12356.1 a lot of times it's they just need more
12357.42 volume
12358.26 so if they can handle that and they're
12359.819 not successfully beat up just give them
12361.02 more volume and they tend to see a lot
12362.76 of breakthroughs you see the same thing
12364.859 with plateaus
12366.239 so typically it's sort of just like okay
12368.04 the routine you're on you've been on it
12369.42 for too long we need to either go to the
12371.52 other end of the hypertrophy Spectrum
12373.08 for intensity which means like if you've
12375.0 been in the like 60 to 70 percent of
12377.64 your one repetition max range maybe we
12379.979 actually need to go heavier
12382.14 take our repetitions down maybe even our
12383.819 total volume down and go heavier try
12385.56 that a great way to break through
12387.0 plateaus of grand if all the other boxes
12389.46 are checked
12391.08 um the other one is is due to the
12392.279 opposite which is like okay we're gonna
12394.08 go higher we're gonna go sets of 20. set
12396.239 to 25 High very high repetition range
12398.58 and really get after it not to do as
12401.04 much damage because you don't tend to
12402.3 get as sore from those really high
12404.16 repetition ranges you'll get more sore
12406.38 from the lower repetition higher
12408.3 intensity range than you will typically
12410.16 the other ones and and see if we can
12412.2 bust through some plateaus there so it
12414.42 just generally means you need to do
12415.5 something a little bit different than
12416.7 your your training partner
12418.439 so we've talked about exercise choice
12420.3 and we've talked about the number of
12422.279 sets that one needs in order to induce
12424.439 hypertrophy per week
12426.479 what about repetition ranges you've
12428.58 mentioned some pretty broad repetition
12430.38 ranges
12431.46 how many repetitions per set is required
12434.76 in order to induce hypertrophy yep so
12437.34 there are two caveats here before I give
12438.84 well the number is somewhere between
12440.34 like four
12441.66 to 30 reps 30 repetitions absolutely in
12445.02 fact I think you can go much higher the
12446.58 first 20 have to be feel exceedingly
12450.359 light correct and during those first 20
12453.479 or so repetitions is the goal still to
12455.46 contract the muscle as hard as possible
12457.439 on each repetition so this is the
12459.0 caveats here so
12461.16 caveat number one
12463.26 is
12464.58 there is an assumption that by the end
12467.76 of this set you're getting somewhat
12469.38 close to failure
12470.939 and so you don't have to go to Absolute
12473.279 failure
12474.42 to to induce most like perjury but you
12477.0 you also have to get kind of close so if
12480.0 you're going to do a set of 25 and you
12481.56 finish it and you're like oh yeah like
12483.899 that was kind of starting to get hard at
12484.979 the end that's not going to be enough
12487.5 if you're going to do a set of five or
12489.06 six and the same sort of expression
12490.8 comes out of your mouth it's not going
12491.819 to be up so in that case it doesn't
12493.2 matter your rep range if you're not
12495.66 getting somewhat close to failure again
12497.7 it doesn't need to be complete failure
12499.62 um a good number to think about is like
12501.359 minus two which is what we call reps and
12503.88 Reserve which is sort of like I got
12506.04 within two or so reps of failure and
12508.319 then I stopped and can we Define failure
12510.359 at least for sake of this portion of the
12511.979 conversation as the point at which you
12515.22 can no longer move the resistance
12519.12 could be your body could be yeah a
12520.92 weight machine Etc that you can no
12523.38 longer move the resistance
12525.84 anymore
12527.399 in the concentric phase
12529.5 of the exercise movement in good form
12532.26 correct that's a really nice momentary
12534.06 muscular failure is how we typically
12535.8 Define it there's a wonderful review I
12537.479 think it's open access that just came
12539.52 out in the last handful of months Eric
12541.92 helms's team out of New Zealand Eric's
12543.899 is a great scientist and a very
12546.479 experienced physique coach and a
12547.859 competitor himself so he knows a lot
12549.18 about this area and that paper rent
12552.06 through all the exact definitions in
12553.859 detail all the caveats that we're not
12556.26 gonna have time to get into today so I
12557.58 would recommend folks like check that
12558.84 out if they want more information but
12560.399 I'll try to get the highlights of it
12562.38 right here so what they basically showed
12564.359 is
12565.14 going all the way to failure in the
12567.72 defining failure like you just did right
12569.76 so momentary muscular failure you can't
12572.7 complete another repetition through
12574.8 complete range of motion through
12576.42 whatever range of motion you determine
12577.8 prior to
12578.939 as well as with good technique so other
12581.04 body parts aren't being compromised sort
12582.779 of Etc and doesn't need to be total
12584.88 failure that minus two
12586.92 failure is still needed
12589.26 in caveat two which is again very very
12592.859 highly trained individuals you won't see
12594.96 people who are like Eric or other folks
12597.3 who are six to eight to ten years in a
12599.34 very serious training
12601.8 um who don't have to go to failure
12603.18 probably a little bit more than what I
12605.22 just said so the the layout that they
12607.859 brought in their paper was very nice and
12609.479 they basically said okay here's a couple
12610.739 of scenarios in which going to failure
12613.08 is maybe the best way to do it number
12615.12 one you probably should do it
12617.46 on a little bit of the safer exercises
12619.859 so maybe taking your back squat on a
12623.22 barbell to complete failure
12625.08 and doing that as like a standard
12626.58 protocol multiple times a week it's
12628.14 maybe not the best choice so maybe if
12631.56 you're going to do barbell back squats
12633.0 you take that to your you know your your
12635.46 one or two reps in reserve stop there
12638.1 it's a lot of work it actually going
12640.2 back to our discussion on the prolapin
12641.819 chart it's a similar idea right where
12643.68 you're going to spend most of your time
12645.0 in these working sets 70 to 90 sort of
12647.76 percent and then you're going to take
12649.26 that failure to maybe the hack squat
12650.88 machine or maybe even the leg extension
12653.04 machine so a little bit of a safer
12654.6 exercise they also can tend to be single
12656.7 joint exercises don't have to be but
12658.92 they're just ones that are not as
12660.18 complicated and you're not likely to
12662.279 injure other body parts when you're
12664.38 doing it all right
12665.7 um so that's one one way to go about it
12668.16 another way to go about it is simply
12670.2 doing it on like the last movement of
12672.54 the day right and so again you're not
12674.58 going to do it on your first three or
12675.899 four exercises but whatever your last
12677.399 finisher is you'll hit total failure on
12680.279 that one and that kind of keeps you in a
12682.68 range of yeah you hit some failure you
12684.779 got a lot of overall work done so that's
12686.76 a lot of stimulus that's a lot of noise
12688.859 going to that nucleus that says grow
12690.359 grow grow but you didn't totally
12692.7 obliterate yourself
12694.399 especially if you don't have the
12696.3 assistance of anabolic steroids right
12698.279 that's very very important if you have
12700.02 those you can push this a lot harder
12701.399 because your recovery would be
12702.72 significantly enhanced if not you kind
12705.18 of want to walk away from that I have to
12706.8 assume that you know 99 of people are
12708.66 saying this do not and um and and yet
12711.359 among those who are not taking anything
12714.0 in terms of anabolics they're I think is
12717.42 a large range of recovery quotients out
12719.7 there some people just tend to recover
12721.26 better some people I think also are far
12723.18 more diligent about what I would call
12725.34 the um necessary but not sufficient
12727.8 variables of yeah adequate sleep yep uh
12730.859 proper nutrition
12732.2 limiting stress and and so on yeah I
12735.899 can't wait to break all that stuff down
12737.22 I got a whole got a very long discussion
12739.56 for all those things we will get into it
12741.54 in all its practical realities and
12744.359 actionables before long what about rest
12747.84 between sets great this is the interplay
12750.359 now so one actually thing we said for a
12752.64 long time is you want to stick between
12753.84 30 to 90 seconds of rest between sets
12757.439 for hypertrophy and that's because
12759.0 you're trying to
12760.979 um activate this metabolic disturbance
12763.8 or disruption you'd need a little bit of
12766.2 a burn a little bit of a pump to go
12767.64 there more recent research a lot of this
12769.68 out of Brad show on Phil's lab and
12771.72 others have shown that that's just
12772.92 doesn't seem to be the case again for
12775.14 moderate uh to newly trained individuals
12778.739 whether that's the case for the highly
12780.06 trained folks I don't necessarily know I
12783.42 don't think there's any difference here
12784.439 so you can take up to three to five
12786.12 minutes of rest in between sets and be
12788.46 fine the caveat here though is this
12792.06 if you're gonna rest longer that means
12794.58 the metabolic challenge is lower so you
12798.06 need to then increase the challenge in
12799.859 either mechanical tension which think
12801.66 about as weight load or muscle breakdown
12805.56 so you can't lower one of the variables
12807.96 keep everything else the same and expect
12809.34 the same result so if you're going to
12811.62 have more rest then you need to either
12813.18 preserve the load on your bar or the
12816.96 volume one of the two has to happen so
12819.239 this gives people a lot of opportunity I
12821.58 generally tell people
12823.859 if you're going to train for hypertrophy
12825.54 it's probably best to stay in a two
12827.279 minute range at most you can go longer
12831.06 but a lot of people have a hard time
12832.68 actually coming back and then executing
12834.479 that next set with enough intent
12836.58 to get there and or it's going to make
12838.859 your workouts tremendously long so you
12841.26 can stick to the shorter one you don't
12843.54 have as much mechanical tension but
12844.979 that's okay you can still get there but
12846.96 in reality of it is you can do whatever
12849.06 you would like
12850.5 tell me if this is a reasonable
12851.88 structure given what you've told us
12854.7 three exercises per muscle group
12857.46 first exercise
12858.92 slightly heavier loads so repetition
12861.72 range is somewhere between let's say
12863.34 five and eight with perhaps hitting
12866.16 failure close to it on the last set
12868.979 rest periods of somewhere between two or
12872.279 let's let's get wild and say five
12874.08 minutes okay so it's a little bit more
12875.88 of a strength type workout at that point
12878.04 but then moving to a second exercise of
12880.38 three or four sets where the repetition
12882.72 ranges and now 8 to 15.
12886.2 shortening the rest periods to 90
12888.479 seconds or so and then on the third
12890.58 exercise
12892.5 repetition ranges of 12 to 30. this
12896.7 number 30 kind of it makes me wide-eyed
12898.8 I know that can't remember the last time
12900.0 I did a set of 30 thinking it was for
12901.92 hypertrophy but what you're saying makes
12903.779 absolutely senses or is research back so
12907.439 very short rest intervals maybe 30
12910.56 seconds between between sets would that
12913.979 allow somebody to Target all three forms
12917.7 of major adaptation I mean my in my mind
12920.34 it works you know you're talking about
12922.02 mechanical loads you're talking about
12923.52 stress and damage and you're talking
12925.38 about metabolic stress
12927.42 is that better than to for instance do
12931.02 all the high repetition work in one
12932.819 workout per week
12935.16 um and then higher loads in the other
12936.779 workout it doesn't matter if you divide
12939.18 them up or combine them it would not
12941.1 matter I would say it matters in the
12943.92 sense of your personal practical
12945.84 situation well long rest for me I love
12948.479 training heavier with longer rest right
12951.06 but
12952.62 I'm hearing that there's real value to
12954.72 doing these higher repetition ranges
12956.279 yeah so the formula you set up there in
12959.58 a second is great if you want to do it
12961.26 the other way that's fine you really
12962.88 it's kind of idiot proof you can set
12965.22 this up however you'd like you could
12966.84 actually do the inverse theoretically
12969.0 you could do the sets of 30 first and
12971.7 then move to your sets of eight it
12973.5 doesn't really matter because we're
12975.6 trying to just get to a certain total
12977.7 stimuli and you're going to hit it
12978.84 eventually so you have a lot of room to
12980.939 play here you also have a lot of room to
12982.979 adapt based on your circumstances God
12985.439 I'm short on time today
12987.12 typically my workout takes me 60 Minutes
12989.1 for this plan I have I've only got 35
12990.899 today what do I do
12993.359 well if you're training for strength
12996.6 that's a different answer than if you're
12998.1 training for hypertrophy if you're
12999.18 training for a purge fee you need to
13001.16 make sure you hit that total volume so
13002.96 in this particular case lower the load
13004.76 lower the rest intervals and just get to
13007.76 the burn and get going as much as you
13009.38 can if you're training for strength I
13011.42 would rather you cut your volume in half
13014.06 get those few repetitions done at that
13016.22 high load and just don't do very many
13018.02 sets today that's a better result so the
13021.739 goal that you're going after is going to
13023.54 determine what we call chaos management
13025.279 which is that thing like that um running
13027.92 out of time today my time is short or I
13030.14 didn't even think my time was short
13031.279 something got cut off I'm not feeling it
13032.84 today I'm in a hotel
13034.64 etc etc etc which is life right that's
13036.62 going to be 10 to 50 of your workouts is
13039.56 going to be chaos management well how
13042.02 you make those decisions is going to go
13044.239 back to understanding number one what
13045.979 goal you're going after the number two
13047.42 what are the physiological consequences
13049.52 we call these physiological limiters
13051.62 for each one and that's going to tell
13053.42 you what to select and prioritize the
13055.819 volume the intensity or whatever else
13059.42 I'd like to ask about
13061.58 frequency but I'd like to frame it a
13064.16 little bit differently
13065.439 than that I'd like to ask about total
13068.779 workout duration which dovetails with
13071.6 frequency because
13073.46 if one is hitting the appropriate number
13075.5 of sets per week
13077.779 and one is combining different muscle
13079.7 groups on the same days well then
13081.92 workouts are going to be a very
13083.239 different duration than if one is doing
13085.16 a different body part each day for
13086.899 instance and so I feel like any
13089.06 discussion about frequency has to be
13091.279 within the context of workout duration
13092.96 and vice versa yeah if you are a
13096.5 a lifting junkie and you're very
13098.96 consistent in your schedule I'm actually
13100.64 okay with body parts but most people are
13103.64 not that and so the concern there is if
13106.04 you say are isolating and waiting to do
13108.26 your glutes on one day of the week and
13110.3 something happens on that day
13112.52 you might go another 13 days now before
13115.399 training it you know between workouts
13117.02 and that's really difficult to maintain
13118.399 the frequency won't be high enough
13119.899 unless the load and volume on that one
13123.08 day is astronomically high it's just not
13126.08 going to happen so while if you look at
13128.359 the research frequency in terms of how
13131.0 many days per week doesn't matter that
13133.22 much as long as the total load and
13135.2 failure are equivalent
13137.239 practically it's a challenge so it's
13140.96 hard because life gets in the way for
13142.939 most people
13144.319 especially if you have kids and a job
13145.939 and all these things over there so I
13147.68 actually prefer doing something more
13149.479 like three days a week of total body and
13152.06 if something happens you've just missed
13153.92 that body part for 48 hours 72 hours I
13157.399 like that a little better for most
13158.54 people not because it's more effective
13159.979 but just because
13161.779 it's a little bit more resilient to life
13164.3 and you can get there if you wanted to
13166.58 actually do a little bit of a
13167.42 combination so if you wanted to do like
13168.979 two days a week of whole body and then
13170.779 two days a week of a little bit of a
13172.04 body part split then you're actually
13173.54 sort of hedging against all risks there
13175.96 as long as you get to that total number
13178.22 there now there is actually some
13180.5 evidence in a couple of ways that maybe
13182.6 a little bit more frequently is a little
13184.34 bit better but the difficulties now
13186.14 we're going back to the practicality
13187.399 question of like how many people really
13189.38 can train just their strength training
13191.6 six days a week that doesn't count any
13194.12 of their long duration stuff it isn't
13195.859 other high heart rate their flexibility
13197.3 their okay it's just really really
13199.34 really hard to get all that stuff in so
13201.62 it is it tends to be easier on folks in
13204.14 terms of execution and long-term
13206.42 adherence in my opinion to get that
13210.26 volume accomplished in in a little bit
13213.02 more frequent patterns but not once a
13215.3 week so I like to kind of have it right
13217.279 there for most people not again not
13219.979 because it is technically more effective
13222.14 because you're less likely
13224.779 to fail to progress because of skipping
13227.6 a workout something popping up your
13229.819 power going out and your you know garage
13232.16 door being locked on your whatever
13234.02 imagine that that happened to me this
13235.7 morning folks couldn't get out of my
13237.02 driveway because the gate with the
13238.7 electronic gate was uh down because the
13241.46 power was down anyway solve that problem
13243.02 yeah the way you describe it my sense is
13245.54 that workouts will last somewhere
13247.16 between one and two hours of real work
13250.16 is that about right it doesn't have to
13251.96 be nearly that long I mean you could
13253.76 certainly get enough the work done in 30
13255.14 minutes if you're doing a whole body
13257.12 workout yeah yeah absolutely so if
13259.279 you're doing that three days a week
13261.02 so remember the numbers we're trying to
13262.7 hit here let's say we're trying to hit
13263.72 15 working sets per muscle group per
13265.52 week that's five working sets per day
13268.46 for muscle groups so if you did one
13270.26 exercise for that day let's say you did
13271.64 squats you did five sets you did that
13273.56 three days a week you're done there's
13274.7 your 15.
13275.899 but there are other muscle groups to hit
13277.7 on the same day you're doing squats if
13279.2 you're doing a whole whole body yeah so
13280.939 you've gotten them all ready and so like
13283.04 all the leg muscles in that example
13285.319 are taken care of uh so you would not do
13287.84 separate hamstring work you wouldn't
13289.52 need to now hamstrings is actually a
13291.739 little bit of a caveat like that's a
13292.819 good example of an exercise or a muscle
13294.739 group that's probably really good to
13296.359 make sure you isolate it's challenging
13298.22 to get with your standard uh dead lift
13300.859 and and the squat it's one of the
13303.439 probably ones that's most important to
13304.58 go Target outside of that but in theory
13306.8 theoretically though outside of that you
13308.42 would get most of your leg muscles done
13310.22 with even a single exercise and even if
13312.56 you wanted to change it up so you said
13314.06 all right Monday I'm going to do a squat
13316.1 variation uh Wednesday the next day I
13318.8 left I'm gonna do some sort of deadlift
13320.439 hinging variation and then maybe Friday
13323.359 my third day I'm going to do some sort
13325.04 of unilateral maybe rear foot elevated
13328.1 split squat or something like that all
13330.319 right maybe even a lateral lunge maybe a
13332.54 different plane okay you're in a pretty
13334.279 good spot you're going to hit most of
13336.14 those muscles
13337.7 um to your 15 working sets especially if
13340.16 you take sort of that last set each day
13342.02 so pretty close to failure that's going
13344.3 to get some more serious work done but
13345.92 you're not going to be so fatigued you
13347.06 can't come back and train it a couple of
13348.26 days later
13349.16 and you'll be fine so you could even
13351.2 split that up into two days a week and
13353.12 now all you really have to do is hit
13354.38 something like seven working sets so
13356.12 maybe that's two exercises per day maybe
13358.64 some sort of a leg press and a leg hinge
13361.88 you know three to four sets each you can
13364.76 hit six to eight sets that day you did
13367.1 that three days a week now all of a
13368.12 sudden you're at that 20 24 sets but
13370.399 same thing with the upper body I just
13372.26 gave lower body examples because you
13374.06 know I like the lower body more so it's
13376.46 not that challenging to get to those
13378.26 numbers and split and those workouts can
13380.42 be extremely short so if you're if
13382.04 you're doing that three days a week
13384.14 um you know you're getting you're doing
13385.34 that one exercise everybody one exercise
13387.38 lower body that certainly shouldn't take
13389.0 more than 40 minutes I'm happy to hear
13391.46 that not because I don't like training
13394.399 yeah please please excuse the double
13396.62 negative but I found that resistance
13399.319 training workouts that extend longer
13401.239 than one hour of work and certainly
13402.8 longer than 75 minutes of work leave me
13404.6 very fatigued oh sure and fatigue to the
13407.54 point where concentrating on cognitive
13409.46 work throughout the day can be
13411.56 challenging need a longer nap in the
13413.42 afternoon I'm a big proponent of naps in
13414.979 the afternoon in any case but requiring
13416.96 longer naps in the afternoon
13419.12 Etc so
13420.56 at least for me restricting the
13422.54 resistance training workouts to about 50
13424.88 50 to 60 Minutes of real work yeah for
13428.72 me three or four times per week has
13430.76 helped tremendously so it's a case where
13432.859 doing higher intensity work in a shorter
13435.5 period of time and actually hitting
13437.54 muscle groups less frequently for me
13439.52 that's again once directly once
13441.14 indirectly yep has worked really well
13443.779 and as you mentioned earlier this could
13446.6 very well be explained by not my
13448.58 recovery quotient as some sort of
13450.739 genetic or physiological variable but
13452.899 the way that I'm training and indeed I
13454.939 like to do a few four straps and go to
13457.04 failure on too many sets and you know
13458.54 I've weaned in the in that genre of
13460.88 training it's also fun like to just
13462.92 train hard it is it's really fun it is I
13465.2 think that um I've learned a lot by
13466.939 training to quote unquote to failure of
13468.92 course I think there's a lot of learning
13470.54 in there provided it's done safely but
13472.819 what you're describing actually inspires
13474.62 me to at least give a try to these other
13476.779 sorts of splits and and ways of training
13478.7 for hypertrophy and strengths because
13480.2 this notion of not necessarily having
13482.0 you go to failure and still being able
13484.279 to evoke strength and hypertrophy
13486.1 adaptations is a really intriguing one
13489.439 uh dare I even say a seductive one and
13492.38 that leads me to a question that is
13495.62 based on findings that I've heard
13497.239 discussed on social media which means
13499.399 very little if anything unless it's in
13502.1 the context of people who really
13503.96 um know exercise science and you're one
13506.66 such person and that's this idea that
13509.6 because resistance training can evoke a
13512.42 protein synthesis adaptation response
13516.5 but that adaptation response is lasts
13520.46 about 48 hours before it starts to taper
13523.34 off that the ideal in quotes frequency
13526.76 for training a given muscle group for
13528.859 hypertrophy is about every 48 hours is
13531.859 that true
13532.76 yes and no so a couple of things there
13536.0 remember in order to grow a muscle
13537.62 there's multiple steps here so you have
13539.42 the signaling response which actually
13540.8 happens within seconds of exercise and
13543.319 can last depending on the marker you
13545.18 know up to an hour or two hours step
13547.1 number two then is gene expression and
13549.8 we see that that's typically peaked
13551.6 around two to six hours post exercise
13553.64 and then you have following that protein
13555.62 synthesis and that's that longer time
13558.14 frame somewhere between 12 hours there
13560.899 it's certainly not peaked for 48 hours
13563.06 it may be still there 48 hours from now
13565.279 but it is is absolutely coming down at
13567.8 that point depending on sort of a number
13569.12 of factors so that part of is sort of
13571.34 true so this is a combination of like
13573.02 some half truths and some like maybe
13574.88 just pedantic things that aren't really
13576.8 that important to differentiate the real
13579.08 question I think is is like okay is it
13582.14 okay to train sooner slash is it better
13584.06 to train sooner or actually is it better
13585.68 to wait longer
13587.42 there's no real reason to think that you
13589.88 need to train if the goal is hypertrophy
13592.399 any sooner than 48 hours afterwards I
13595.399 can't think of an advantage that that
13597.5 would confer
13598.64 I I also can't think of any practical
13601.279 applications
13602.899 athletes physique bodybuilders coaches
13606.2 that ever found tremendous success doing
13608.3 that so I would be very skeptical that
13611.12 that is anyway better now could you do
13613.939 it in some instances of say you know
13616.16 you've got travel coming up like that so
13618.08 that you just yeah you want to preload
13619.88 the system by destroying the muscle no
13622.279 problem and then waiting seven days or
13624.439 14 days I've known people have done that
13626.18 before I do Vacations or layoffs every
13628.46 time like every single annihilate
13630.26 themselves and then take a two-week
13631.64 layoff yeah and it's like there's no
13633.02 benefit there other than psychological
13634.7 like I just love it like it feels great
13636.68 to be super sore I feel less crappy not
13638.54 training for those couple days because
13639.68 I'm like I'm super sore anyway you need
13641.18 the extended rest yeah of course and
13643.76 it's just like
13645.439 it's just a crappy justification in my
13647.72 brain that like
13649.399 excuse to do something really wild and
13651.38 that I totally don't need and get way
13652.64 sore that I should get Dr Andy galvin's
13654.739 suggestions of what not to do but that
13657.56 he does yeah 100 so do as I say not as I
13660.5 do the famous words of every research
13662.12 Professor yeah I think 48 hours is a
13663.979 reasonable time uh to wait can't think
13666.979 of any advantage of going sooner than
13668.12 that there's really not a tremendous
13669.439 amount of advantage of waiting much
13670.7 longer than that certainly 72 hours is
13672.38 fine as long as you're hitting these
13674.72 Concepts we've talked about you can let
13677.18 really life
13678.5 determine that I mean there's situations
13680.84 too with like particularly our athletes
13683.239 where we have to kind of break that
13684.8 because of schedule obligations they're
13687.14 playing every fifth day every third day
13689.06 or something like that you're just gonna
13690.02 have to lift some back-to-back days
13691.279 you're just gonna have to get it done
13693.56 um but yeah I can't think of why I'd go
13695.779 out of my way to do that the
13698.479 second part of that question is let's
13701.0 say somebody trains a muscle
13703.88 they train it properly they hit it in
13705.739 the appropriate rep ranges and
13707.12 appropriate rest Etc that the stimulus
13709.58 is there the adaptation is set in motion
13711.8 they're getting someone where somewhere
13715.52 at 48 hours or so a protein synthesis
13717.979 Peak that's going to taper off yeah but
13720.859 they don't train it 48 hours later or 72
13723.5 hours later they train it five or six
13725.06 days later not because they're lazy not
13727.16 because they um they don't care but
13729.739 because they have other priorities that
13731.779 are woven in with getting hypertrophy in
13734.899 this muscle right there are people who
13736.64 exist only to get hypertrophy in a given
13738.38 muscle group but let's be fair most
13739.76 people would like to grow that muscle
13741.2 group
13742.58 but then does it necessarily mean that
13745.46 the muscle starts to revert to its
13747.5 pre-hypertrophic state that is does it
13749.54 atrophy and get smaller again because if
13751.279 it doesn't I could see a lot of reasons
13753.5 for hitting a muscle group once every
13754.7 five days or seven days provided you
13756.319 hold on to the hypertrophy that you
13758.54 initiated five or seven days ago yeah
13760.52 there's no reason to think you will lose
13761.779 anything in that sort of a Time domain
13764.3 five to seven days the only challenge
13766.22 with training that infrequently is can
13768.739 you actually get enough total volume
13770.06 done so if you're going to train them
13772.16 also once a week you either have to go
13774.5 to real failure real damage and soreness
13778.16 or you have to figure out a way to hit
13779.72 20 cents that day in that muscle not at
13782.18 all impossible especially if you're
13783.62 thinking well actually all I have to do
13784.58 is 15. I'm gonna do five sets of three
13787.76 exercises that's not outrageous not at
13790.34 all so so like absolutely possible if
13792.739 you're wanting to go more towards 20
13794.0 we're getting closer to that 25 like now
13796.939 it starts to get pretty challenging so
13799.06 scientifically the research will suggest
13801.26 it's going to be equally effective
13803.899 practically it's challenging for people
13806.06 to hit sufficient volume without just
13808.1 being so demoralized afterwards because
13810.14 they're in so much pain they can't get
13811.7 out of their car because their legs are
13813.26 so trash they can't sit on the toilet
13814.7 and get back up without crying from pain
13816.92 so that's not good no that's not good I
13819.56 say that because those are actual
13820.76 examples that have happened in my life
13822.38 yeah I I I'm realizing as we're having
13825.14 this conversation about ways to
13827.06 stimulate hypertrophy that I've sort of
13829.46 defaulted to more intensity as opposed
13831.8 to volume because of the time factor I
13833.479 have a lot of other things going on in
13834.859 my life and So within that hour
13836.899 I Can't Get Enough sets in across all
13839.6 the muscle groups I need to hit and I'm
13840.92 only going to do it about once a week
13842.359 and so it's at least for me more
13845.6 advantageous to just train extremely
13847.22 hard I actually use the pre-exhaustion
13848.84 technique that you mentioned before yep
13850.52 or pre-fatigue as you refer to it of
13852.62 hitting something really strong with an
13854.12 isolation exercise then doing compound
13855.739 exercises I'm starting to think based on
13858.979 what you've told me that pre-fatigue
13863.239 and then a compound exercise in some
13865.58 ways it's not really two sets because if
13867.92 you're going to fail your four straps
13869.96 you're kind of pushing past failure then
13871.76 you're doing a compound exercise and
13873.38 you're doing that two or three times
13874.779 well that sounds like four to six sets
13877.88 but the force repetitions are almost
13881.0 like an additional set right yep and so
13883.939 it's not 20 sets but it's four to six
13886.819 really really hard sets that go beyond
13889.1 what we normally think of as a set
13890.66 totally okay it's sort of the difference
13892.46 between running on concrete and running
13893.899 on Sand when I go for a sand run it's a
13896.479 very different experience totally yeah
13898.16 and this is why I should have mentioned
13900.62 this at the very very beginning of our
13902.18 our chat today but all of these numbers
13904.88 that I'll give you for any exercise
13906.56 adaptation you you cannot think of them
13909.26 as hard lines they are gradients and so
13913.16 when we think about the number for
13914.779 hypertrophy in terms of repetitions I
13916.819 said 4 to 30. what do you think happens
13918.859 at three do you think hypertrophages
13921.08 stops in fact the number you'll see in
13923.42 literature is more like six to Thirty I
13925.16 actually slide it down to four though
13926.84 like personal preference because of that
13928.34 but it just Fades away what do you think
13929.899 happens at rep 31 35 there's no it just
13932.3 Fades gradually over time so you
13936.02 actually sort of brought this up one of
13937.1 your other questions and I'm not sure if
13938.72 you were even thinking about this or
13939.62 maybe you were I just babbled on about
13942.08 something else but if strength happens
13944.3 between this like one to five repetition
13946.58 range and hypertrophy typically happens
13948.979 in this like 8 to 30 range what happens
13951.979 if I were to do the sets of six or God
13954.439 forbid seven like seven and nine are
13956.42 these numbers you just absolutely don't
13957.68 do in strength training right it's just
13959.479 like so that's a one two three four five
13961.46 six got eight ten twelve like do not
13963.62 program a set of 30. now when I'm
13965.0 trained sets of seven to nine yeah it's
13966.8 great
13967.54 uh we'll use sets of seven a lot with
13970.64 weightlifters because you can actually
13971.66 count numbers more effectively but what
13973.58 happens in seven to nine right so this
13975.62 is actually a wonderful area of these
13977.479 like
13978.46 five to eight repetitions where you're
13981.14 going to get a nice combination of a lot
13982.88 of strength gains and a lot of
13984.319 hypertrophy so someone who's coming in
13986.42 going man I want to get stronger and I
13989.0 want to add muscle what do I do here
13991.16 well that's actually a really nice
13992.239 answer train pretty hard in that like
13994.76 four to eight repetition range and
13997.04 you're going to get a lot stronger and
13998.3 you'll still induce a lot of hypertrophy
14000.04 if you want to really maximize
14003.04 hypertrophy I would probably spend most
14005.26 of your time in the 8 to 15 repetition
14008.68 per set range you can go up to 30.
14011.62 admittedly though I don't think it's
14013.3 optimal to spend most of your time at
14015.52 more than 15 reps per set it's very
14018.04 challenging to maintain the focus
14020.02 required at rep 27 to actually get
14023.14 sufficient failure by rep there you just
14024.939 you just give up way too early it's hard
14026.38 to do the same thing at the bottom end
14028.359 of that Spectrum in terms of of really
14030.939 heavy to get there so I really honestly
14033.399 think 8 to 15 is still it's cliche it's
14036.04 that textbook number but it's a reason
14037.6 that's a like it is tried and true and
14039.76 very very very effective if for instance
14042.22 you want to get stronger though
14044.26 and not invoke a lot of hypertrophy you
14047.62 have a couple of tricks you can pull
14049.06 number one stay south of that five
14051.939 repetition range you do sets of one sets
14054.939 of two go as heavy as you can with all
14058.18 appropriate considerations
14060.04 and stick within maybe even up to three
14061.779 reps per set you start getting to four
14063.76 to five to six now you're gonna start
14065.199 itching towards that that hypertriot
14067.42 range so stay down there do a lot more
14069.58 total sets so do a classic example would
14072.58 be something like eight sets of three
14074.8 right you're going to get a lot of
14076.479 practice you're going to get 24 very
14077.979 high quality reps with a lot of rest in
14080.38 between okay you go from there you go to
14082.66 managing caloric intake making sure your
14085.3 protein is still on point you want to
14087.22 recover but if your total calories
14089.02 aren't um you know greater than 10 to 15
14091.54 above your maintenance needs then you're
14094.0 not going to be able to put on a whole
14095.38 bunch of muscle mass because you just
14096.88 don't have the fuel for it you can also
14099.279 then space your workouts out so that
14101.38 stimulus isn't coming extremely often so
14103.899 if you do that thing a couple of times a
14105.22 week it's not enough frequency in that
14107.56 signal so remember that signal has to be
14109.479 frequent or loud you didn't make it
14111.46 super loud and now you're not making a
14113.439 super frequent you can get very very
14115.18 very strong like that and and put on
14117.939 very low amounts of vibratory if that's
14120.819 sort of the choice
14122.199 so you told us a lot about volume and
14124.72 frequency and how that relates to
14126.22 protein synthesis and Recovery to evoke
14128.739 the hypertrophy adaptation response how
14131.979 should people think about systemic
14134.26 damage and Recovery because obviously
14136.6 the nervous system and the way it
14138.699 interacts with the neuromuscular system
14140.14 is the site of all the action here or at
14143.62 least a lot of the action
14146.02 and the nervous system can in fact
14148.06 become fatigued you know that has a
14150.88 great capacity but the whole system that
14153.04 we're talking about can be worked to the
14155.92 extent that even if a muscle group like
14158.439 the biceps or the back is being allowed
14160.3 to rest while you're training legs and
14161.859 other muscle groups that your whole
14163.779 neuromuscular system needs rest how does
14166.66 one determine whether or not your entire
14168.279 body needs complete rest or or low level
14171.22 active rest or exercise of a different
14172.84 kind yeah yeah sure so I want to
14175.0 actually tackle this because we're on
14176.319 the topic of hypertrophy I'm assuming
14178.0 that that's the goal in mind here yes
14180.16 here I'm asking specifically within the
14181.96 contracts of hypertrophy I realize that
14183.88 for other training goals the answer of
14186.1 this question could be quite different
14186.939 yeah okay so we actually do this in a
14188.319 couple of different ways let's start
14189.22 local and work back to systemic right
14191.08 because number one what you're really
14194.02 concerned about is at the local muscle
14197.26 level is am I going to create excessive
14198.76 damage
14199.72 and I don't necessarily mean muscle
14201.279 damage I mean injury right so um the
14203.5 kind of rule of thumb we use is like
14204.699 three out of ten in terms of soreness if
14206.38 you're more than three out of ten in
14207.939 terms of soreness we're going to start
14210.16 asking questions if you're higher than
14211.66 six out of ten we're probably not
14213.699 training this is subjective total
14215.68 subjective measure right and you'll
14217.359 you'll know very quickly right I feel
14218.979 like if you can barely graze your PEC
14221.199 with your fingertip and then you're like
14222.399 ah I don't care what you score that
14224.56 we're not training there's just no
14226.06 damage if you're three out of ten if
14228.1 you're just like oh I'm kind of like a
14229.42 little bit stiff here but once you get
14231.16 warmed up you start feeling okay you're
14232.899 probably okay to proceed there so that
14234.819 is is
14235.96 a very easy way to just think about
14238.319 soreness you're going to be a little bit
14240.04 tight depending on your training
14241.0 frequency
14241.899 now zooming out to systemic we use a
14244.3 whole host of things so we actually have
14245.62 a a whole host of biomarkers we use you
14248.26 can get a lot of these from blood so you
14249.76 can look at things like creatine kinase
14251.14 that's the very common one marker of
14253.06 muscle damage um we'll actually look at
14255.12 LDH we'll look at myoglobulin that's
14258.52 just like if you think about hemoglobin
14260.08 is the
14261.399 um is the molecule that carries oxygen
14263.319 throughout your blood the myoglobin is
14265.0 the the part of that that's actually in
14266.92 muscle so when muscle gets broken down
14268.54 that gets leaked out and put in your
14269.8 blood that's one of the markers actually
14271.479 it's gonna be associated with things
14272.439 like rhabdo which is uh like you're
14274.66 going to see your urine is purple and
14276.399 it's extremely dark because you've got
14277.6 so much muscle breakdown that that
14279.1 happens and kidneys can have a problem
14280.779 and you put a bunch of stuff in there so
14282.22 we use those biomarkers we'll actually
14283.899 also look at probably a couple things
14285.52 you're familiar with alt and ASD these
14288.34 are excellent biomarkers of muscle
14289.66 breakdown so if we are actually
14290.979 suspecting that this is a chronic
14292.54 problem we're going to actually go and
14294.939 pull some blood if it's just like I'm
14297.279 super sore today we're going to use that
14298.66 subjective marker but if we're seeing
14300.1 this as constant like man are we really
14301.66 pushed pushing you way too much is there
14303.279 some sort of systemic problem we're
14305.38 going to blood and we're going to look
14306.22 at all those different things now AST to
14308.26 alt is really specific and I don't want
14310.3 to take us too far off track here but
14311.859 the ratio to those things is actually
14313.66 very important as well so if you look at
14315.64 the AST to alt ratio typically the
14317.5 number we'll look at is like 1.67 as
14319.84 that ratio is like higher than that you
14321.46 have a pretty high risk of muscle damage
14322.899 but really
14324.399 between you know me and you and a few of
14327.16 these listeners anytime we start seeing
14329.199 AST out kick alt we're immediately
14331.239 thinking it has a ratio being higher
14332.92 than one we're immediately thinking like
14335.08 there's something happening muscle
14336.1 damage wise so um that's actually a
14337.84 sneaky good indicator of just total
14339.279 muscle mass because the vast majority of
14341.26 that's going to be in muscle so those
14343.6 are actually some markers that we like a
14345.279 lot if muscle damage is the thing we're
14348.22 concerned with if we are more concerned
14350.08 with things like total training volume
14352.479 systemic overload then we may turn to
14355.0 something more like sleep there's a lot
14357.34 of information we can actually get gland
14359.02 from changes in sleep behavior and
14361.479 function you could also look at things
14363.34 like HRV heart rate variability which is
14365.62 a very classic marker and much more
14368.02 sensitive to changes with training than
14370.06 something like a resting heart rate
14371.26 which is which is one thing you can
14373.18 actually do that's totally cost free
14374.319 just look at your changes and any
14376.359 elevation resting heart rate over time
14379.18 especially more than three to five
14380.92 consecutive days it is an indicator but
14383.199 HIV is much more sensitive to things
14386.02 like training induced overload so that's
14388.359 a quick version of stuff that we're
14389.8 going to pay attention to the last one I
14391.3 would add there is simply motivation
14393.76 so if you're really training hard and
14395.26 you like training hard and you just like
14396.58 cannot force yourself to go anymore that
14399.22 in of itself can be a good indication of
14400.96 it's maybe not the day maybe not the
14402.939 week with all of these things you want
14405.88 to be careful about overreacting to a
14407.62 single day measure again we look we need
14410.319 to look at at least a trend of more than
14412.359 three days honestly I'm looking at more
14414.04 than five days I'm gonna pull back from
14416.56 that and think about what phase of
14418.12 training we're in what part of the Year
14419.8 we're in typically with our athletes
14421.18 we're in season preseason post-season
14422.8 off season Etc to make our decisions
14424.96 about what we're going to do about it
14426.22 are we canning the entire workout are we
14428.5 doing a modified lower version lower
14430.3 intensity my default generally if
14433.479 hypertrophy is the goal remember
14436.12 volume is the driver there so if I can
14439.12 like can we get in can we go real light
14441.1 let's go to 6 out of 10 rpe so relative
14444.64 perceived exertion maybe we'll reduce
14447.1 the range of motion maybe we'll make it
14449.92 a little bit easier maybe go to machines
14451.479 or instead of going a squat we'll just
14453.279 do you know uh leg extension something
14455.68 like that but I want to still get enough
14457.359 volume in there that will keep you on
14458.979 target any again even going at 50 not
14462.399 not to high repetition you know 50 for a
14464.68 set of ten three sets just get a nice
14466.54 blood flow in there get it in get it out
14468.34 aid in recovery and then move on and
14470.56 come back the next day that's probably
14471.699 what I would do rather than canning the
14473.979 entire session
14475.3 how do other forms of exercise
14478.779 combine with hypertrophy training
14481.899 for instance can I do cardiovascular
14484.96 training for two or three days per week
14488.439 provided that cardiovascular training is
14490.899 of low enough intensity and not disrupt
14494.58 hypertrophy progression
14497.26 and
14499.0 can I do that cardiovascular exercise
14502.12 before or after the hypertrophy training
14505.72 or does it need to be separated out the
14508.479 answer to this is really what we call
14510.399 the crossover air interference effect
14512.14 okay it's really an energy management
14513.66 issue so the only time
14517.12 endurance exercise starts to interfere
14519.399 or block or hinder attenuate hypertrophy
14522.64 is in one of two broad categories number
14524.56 one total energy intake or your balance
14526.96 is off so you can ameliorate this by
14529.42 just eating more if you do that then the
14531.399 interference effect generally goes away
14532.66 the second one is you want to make sure
14534.46 you avoid exercise forms for your
14536.439 endurance training that are the same
14538.6 working group and specifically The
14540.279 Eccentric portion so for example we see
14542.08 much more interference with running
14543.52 unlike hypertrophy then we move cycling
14546.88 right less eccentric pounding and
14548.68 loading less damage less things to
14550.18 recover from the tissue seems to be
14552.16 totally fine the only other thing you
14554.08 need to worry about here is total volume
14556.18 of your endurance work so if you're
14558.04 doing a moderate intensity for a
14560.199 moderate duration say 70 of your maximum
14563.56 heart rate for 25 minutes it's unlikely
14566.38 to do much damage in terms of blocking
14568.779 hypertrophy you're totally fine can you
14571.0 do it before or after your workout it's
14572.439 probably not going to matter that much
14573.58 all right so pre-fatigue is okay for
14575.56 hypertrophy so if your pre-fatigue is
14577.479 coming from endurance then you're
14579.34 totally fine not a big deal afterwards
14581.62 cool you want to break it up into
14583.72 multiple sessions that's probably better
14585.46 right so if you do your endurance work
14587.08 on a separate day that's probably best
14589.06 case scenario if you can't do that but
14590.92 you can break it up into two workouts
14592.3 say you lift in the morning and then you
14593.739 do your quote-unquote cardio at night
14595.42 maybe that's second best third best is
14598.0 doing it at the end of your lift and
14600.279 finishing it that's fine just make sure
14602.26 that you're maximizing your recovery on
14605.14 all the other tricks we'll talk about
14606.34 later make sure the calories are there
14608.38 make sure you're not doing a lot of
14609.58 eccentric Landing in that endurance
14611.319 stuff and you'll be just fine and where
14613.54 does higher intensity cardio fit into a
14616.12 hypertrophy program so higher intensity
14618.699 cardio for instance in my mind is
14623.02 getting on the assault bike and doing
14625.72 um you know eight intervals of 20 second
14628.479 Sprints and 10 second rest in between or
14631.12 perhaps go into a field and doing some
14633.399 bounds and Sprints and things of that
14635.08 sort not going all out not you know
14637.779 running for one's life but getting up to
14640.06 about you know 85 90 percent of of
14642.399 running for one's life so we have a lot
14644.979 less information on the potential
14646.479 interference or not of high intensities
14648.22 of it um the stuff we do have suggested
14650.62 it may actually Aid
14652.12 and hypertrophy and that's because if
14654.16 you think about it one the potential
14655.6 paths to activation and muscle growth is
14657.52 this metabolic disturbance you're going
14660.46 to get that a lot with the the high
14661.72 intensity interval thing so it's not a
14663.399 terrible thing to do I wouldn't do it to
14666.22 the level that it compromises your
14667.72 ability to come back and do your primary
14669.16 training so if you're so fatigued your
14671.02 legs are super heavy and they're
14672.819 depleted you now have to ingest extra
14675.04 carbohydrates to replenish muscle
14676.6 glycogen to be able to handle both
14678.399 recovery and continued training Etc that
14681.16 could then lead to a problem but in
14682.6 general we really don't see any reason
14684.64 why that is going to completely block or
14686.739 or make it such that your training was
14688.96 quote unquote wasted or it didn't work
14690.76 in fact actually
14693.46 um a very recent study came out where
14696.34 they had individuals perform six weeks
14699.22 of purely aerobic endurance steady state
14702.52 long duration endurance for six weeks I
14704.62 think prior to starting a hypertrophy
14706.359 phase compared that to individuals who
14708.16 did not do that and those folks that did
14710.62 these six weeks of just I think it was
14713.199 cycling actually
14714.58 just endurance work
14716.56 had more muscle growth at the end of
14718.779 their hypertrophy training than those
14720.04 folks that did not
14721.239 so this shows you very clearly there are
14724.12 a lot of advantages that come with being
14725.739 physically fit to Growing muscle so
14728.199 folks that also have actually hit
14730.3 plateaus a lot one of the things you may
14732.46 actually see some benefit from is
14733.779 actually doing a little bit more
14734.8 endurance work whether it's a steady
14736.239 state stuff maybe a side the higher
14738.22 intensity stuff certainly if you're
14740.5 starting a training phase it's a pretty
14742.06 good idea to do that and there's a
14743.62 number of physiological reasons of why
14745.779 that's potentially occurring but the the
14748.12 lowest hanging fruit here is weak sort
14750.58 of joke you know like if you're so unfit
14752.68 that you're tying your shoes in your
14754.899 warm-up and you're already breaking a
14756.16 sweat you probably don't have enough
14758.199 Fitness to do enough training to get
14761.02 enough hypertree so that is in fact your
14763.0 limiting factor you're not recovering
14764.979 you're super fatigued and damaged and
14767.68 sore
14768.699 because you're so unfit so get fit first
14771.699 and then you can actually get more gains
14773.68 a week later so you have to kind of Kick
14775.6 the Can down the road for a few weeks
14777.399 but 10 weeks later you'll be in a better
14779.319 spot than you were by investing a little
14781.0 bit in your conditioning so as you
14782.38 pointed out before and I can only assume
14783.939 you're referring to me hypertrophy
14786.04 training is idiot proof meaning there's
14788.8 a lot of leeway in the variables but not
14791.319 so much leeway that people can do
14793.18 anything it it's bounded by these
14795.699 general principles
14798.46 so with your permission I'm going to do
14800.26 a brief overview of my notes based on
14803.439 your description of the modifiable
14805.479 variables that will direct somebody
14808.06 towards hypertrophy keeping in mind this
14810.819 backdrop of exercise Choice exercise
14812.979 order
14814.239 selecting appropriate volume that sets
14816.46 and Reps training frequency and needing
14819.1 some Metric or way to have progression
14822.58 either by adding more weight or by more
14824.92 tension or more metabolic stress and so
14827.08 on
14828.04 in terms of exercise Choice it sounds
14830.5 like the choice of exercises is not
14833.56 super critical in terms of specificity
14835.66 yeah but that the ideal circumstances
14838.18 that people are targeting all the major
14840.699 and frankly
14842.62 secondary and minor muscle groups if you
14844.66 can even call them that yeah across
14847.239 their exercise choices that they're
14848.979 picking exercises that they can perform
14850.899 safely and that they can generate enough
14853.239 intensity so they're getting close to
14854.859 failure without placing themselves into
14857.26 danger right so um for some people that
14860.859 might mean including large compound free
14862.479 weight exercises like squats and
14863.92 deadlifts and bent over barbell rows as
14867.1 well as isolation exercises and for some
14869.319 people there might be a biased toward
14871.84 more isolation exercises and machines
14873.699 but of course machines don't necessarily
14875.26 mean that you can't use heavy loads in
14877.779 fact plate loaded machines like Hammer
14879.22 strange machines it will allow for quite
14881.02 substantial loads so picking two or
14884.739 three or more movements per muscle group
14887.859 can be valuable
14889.66 but that overall
14891.64 consistency is going to outshine
14895.12 variation in the sense that you don't
14897.46 need to hit muscles with a different
14899.439 exercise every workout coming back to
14901.3 the same things
14902.92 has a benefit and we heard about this in
14904.96 our discussion around strength and power
14906.279 as well
14907.3 okay
14908.38 in terms of order of exercises there too
14911.08 it sounds like there's a lot of
14912.34 flexibility one could
14914.5 do the large compound exercise
14916.96 for let's say quadriceps and hamstrings
14919.479 and glutes first like a squat or a front
14921.46 squat
14922.84 or could deadlift for that matter but
14925.0 then if one deadlifted and primarily hit
14927.34 the glutes and hamstrings then you might
14928.779 want to Target the quadriceps more
14931.54 directly with leg extensions or if one
14933.46 squatted and was loading that squat bar
14936.22 carrying the squat bar in a way that was
14937.779 predominantly quadricep yeah and less so
14940.3 glute and hamstring than leg curls would
14943.239 be a good choice Etc okay and train your
14945.76 calves folks
14947.02 very important unless you're a genetic
14948.939 freak of course it's actually a good
14950.739 opportunity to say unless you're a
14951.88 genetic freak or you just have a genetic
14953.26 predisposition yeah or you've done
14955.06 Sports and and you have a genetic
14956.5 predisposition that gives you you know
14958.359 very large caps that don't require any
14960.22 training at all I I know people like
14961.72 this they're they're somewhat rare but
14963.46 they're out there yeah and those folks
14965.199 sometimes want to stay away from or
14967.06 minimize their training you told me that
14969.1 even if you have a muscle group that's a
14970.779 hyper responder
14972.1 in terms of hypertrophy getting at least
14974.56 one or two
14975.939 good hard sets per week is good because
14978.279 you want to keep functionality in that
14979.899 neuromuscular system love it okay in
14982.66 terms of volume again we have a large
14985.0 amount of variation is what I'm hearing
14987.58 that the total number of sets per week
14990.34 is a strong driving force of program
14993.279 design and selection
14995.26 that ideally you're performing 10 to 20
14999.04 and probably more like 15 to 20 sets per
15001.56 week and that could be divided up across
15003.359 multiple workouts or done in one workout
15006.06 but that's 10 to 20 sets per week per
15009.3 muscle group
15010.8 not really taking into account indirect
15012.899 Activation so that would be 10 to 20
15015.239 sets for biceps
15017.34 your back work is going to hit your
15019.02 biceps a little bit maybe a bit more
15020.64 depending on the exercise selection but
15023.04 it's really 10 to 20 and given that
15025.199 hypertrophy can still occur and maybe
15027.479 even occurs better with more volume yeah
15029.939 then don't include the indirect work
15032.1 unless
15033.3 something about the architecture of your
15035.399 body and the inability to engage certain
15037.5 muscle groups like makes the a pull-up
15040.26 really an arm exercise for you do I have
15042.0 that right the way that I would maybe
15043.199 Define it is typically with movements we
15045.3 consider to be there to be primary
15046.859 movers secondary movers and then
15049.199 tertiary right if it is a primary or
15052.14 secondary I'm probably counting it if
15054.239 it's tertiary or less I'm probably not
15056.46 counting it got it so going back to our
15058.859 example of a pull-up so an example of a
15061.5 pull-up I probably wouldn't count the
15062.939 biceps in a pull-up but I would probably
15064.26 count the biceps during a chin up would
15066.479 you count the rear deltoid in a pull-up
15068.22 probably not maybe like uh it just
15072.06 depends um probably not though okay
15073.979 train the rear delts also that's only
15075.779 honestly the reason I answered that is
15077.16 because most people don't do anything
15078.0 for the real adults anyways but they
15079.68 should right absolutely that's why I
15081.239 didn't want to count it I wanted you to
15082.26 go out of your way to make sure you did
15083.46 something specifically for the real rear
15085.38 delts for Aesthetics and for
15086.52 functionality for health and and balance
15089.1 across the shoulders totally neck uh
15091.62 shoulder all of it I'm so happy to hear
15093.72 you say this I'm a huge fan of people
15096.239 doing rear deltoid work for all the
15098.1 reasons you described n network for that
15100.199 matter I think people forget that the
15102.0 neck is the upper part of your spine
15103.38 yeah yeah and for postural reasons and
15106.08 for stabilization safety reasons it's
15108.42 really critical but
15110.16 I think most people aren't familiar with
15111.899 how best to train the rear deltoids and
15113.88 neck and I know a number of people are
15115.68 afraid of getting a big neck which for
15118.739 reasons that are still unclear to me is
15121.439 referred to as no neck but let's leave
15122.939 out that no neck comment for the moment
15125.52 what are some good exercises for
15127.439 targeting the rear deltoids and neck
15129.72 safely
15130.92 that people can perform for
15133.64 stabilization and for hypertrophy yeah I
15137.399 would recommend people check out Eric
15138.96 Cressy he is a wonderful strength
15142.62 conditioning coach he actually is I
15144.3 think the director of pitching for the
15146.1 New York Yankees now is that spelled
15148.22 c-r-e-s-s-i-e
15150.56 c-r-e-s-s-e-y I believe and he's got a
15153.18 facility in uh I believe Boston as well
15156.359 as in Florida so he's very very involved
15159.479 in pitching as well as hockey and things
15162.0 like that so
15163.199 um he has so many free videos and
15166.68 resources on a on so much of the
15169.02 shoulder girdle mostly because he he's
15170.699 dealt with overhead and throwing
15172.02 athletes and so the Precision required
15174.359 there is tremendous so you want to be
15176.64 very careful when you start playing in
15178.38 this area because the wrong positioning
15180.96 of your scapula can cause a whole bunch
15182.939 of problems in your neck and low back
15184.68 and so he would be a great resource to
15186.479 go take a look at that um depending on
15187.859 how your your scapulas are gliding and
15190.439 sliding and the way that you want your
15192.359 rotator cuffs firing your rhomboids
15195.06 there's it's like very complicated very
15197.22 quickly so you want to learn more go
15199.02 there
15199.92 as a very very quick couple of answers
15203.04 um one of my favorite exercises is is
15204.72 lying on a bench or putting some bench
15207.359 and then just doing a reverse fly
15208.699 basically the reason I like stabilizing
15211.859 the rest of the body so you can make
15213.18 sure you can focus on just using those
15214.8 rear dual ties and putting your your
15216.239 scapulas in the right position now
15217.62 there's a there's a specific set of
15219.06 cueing that you want the scapula to move
15220.92 down and back for again check out Eric
15223.199 or any number of folks in that area to
15225.6 do it but that's a very simple way uh
15227.64 the reverse fly to get there great and
15229.8 then in terms of neck exercises I was
15232.02 told to avoid Bridges because they can
15234.479 cause damage to the discs I will
15236.279 probably never do a bridge ever uh the
15238.979 rest of my life so isometrics are a
15241.8 great exercise for that because if you
15243.239 think about what uh what you're asking
15245.52 muscle groups to do in the neck you
15247.68 mostly want it to be able to do a
15249.06 certain type of rotation a little bit of
15250.56 flexion extension and some some other
15253.38 movements but in general it should be
15254.939 being stable so you want to walk through
15257.279 these joints by asking kind of what they
15258.96 do are they a moving joint are they a
15260.279 stability joint in this case you want to
15261.779 be there so isometrics are going to put
15263.399 you in a much better position there are
15265.14 some actually pretty cool devices that
15266.819 you can wear and you can put them on
15267.84 your head and you can do all kinds of
15269.16 movement and get some great training
15271.68 there those are great starts but if you
15273.3 don't have any of that just basic
15274.739 isometrics are a great way to go about
15276.899 it um neck Bridges would not be on that
15278.819 list for me no neck Bridges folks
15282.6 in terms of sets and repetitions we
15285.779 briefly touched on this but anyway from
15287.699 I believe six repetitions all the way up
15290.16 to 30 repetitions but probably more in
15292.319 the
15293.54 8 to 15 repetition range for hypertrophy
15297.66 most of the time yeah and I'll just
15299.88 throw in there because I love this idea
15301.68 that if you want to get a
15303.899 relatively balanced adaptation related
15307.319 to strength and hypertrophy that seven
15308.939 to nine range the the No Man's uh or Dan
15312.359 no woman's uh land of
15314.699 of training repetitions I always joke in
15317.04 class I'm like okay we go through the
15318.479 whole thing right you're like one to
15319.439 five strength eight to twelve you know I
15321.96 perch reading like right and then I'm
15323.34 like okay so six to nine means nothing
15324.899 will happen at all the kids are just
15326.64 like writing it down like
15328.5 right a good way to for everybody to
15330.54 remember that there are adaptations
15332.58 triggered in the six to nine rep range
15334.14 and it's a balance of strength and
15335.399 height you'll just get thrown out of any
15336.66 gym that I'm a part of fantastic if you
15338.46 do that uh so
15341.22 but the important point is to get close
15343.26 to failure and occasionally hit failure
15345.72 maybe occasionally throw in a forced
15348.18 repetition or a rest pause where you
15350.22 rest and then do a few more something
15351.84 like that but those intensity increasing
15354.02 Maneuvers will require a little bit more
15357.779 attention to recovery either time or or
15360.06 attention in some other way and here's a
15361.56 little bit of care and I'll throw at
15362.64 people
15363.96 because people generally don't like to
15366.06 be told to not go to failure that often
15368.819 right so there's a handful of like half
15370.26 the folks are like sweet I don't have to
15371.819 train that hard to get there and those
15373.62 folks it's like well yes but I also said
15375.239 you just can't like do a half workout
15376.62 you have to get pretty darn close to
15378.779 failure and most people don't really
15380.76 know what failure means so for that
15382.439 group it's actually it's still probably
15383.64 harder than you think you want to train
15385.199 the other group though that like wants
15386.699 to completely blow themselves out every
15388.319 single time
15389.479 dragging them back is more the key now
15392.819 for those folks here's what I can say
15395.34 if you make sure that your hidden
15397.199 stressors invisible stressors are
15399.54 completely taken care of you can go to
15401.399 failure a lot more often and so you need
15403.979 to dial those things in and then now you
15405.72 can go hammer yourself because you'll
15406.979 recover so much quicker and we see this
15408.84 very commonly in all of our programs
15412.14 with our athletes and our non-athletes
15414.18 that when we get the rest of the Hidden
15416.46 invisible stressors taken care of their
15418.62 training volume goes up so much because
15420.479 they'll just start coming back and
15421.739 they're like oh my God I'm not sore
15422.88 anymore oh my God I'm not nearly a sore
15425.34 I did this exact workout you know
15427.38 countless times before and now I'm doing
15429.239 it and I'm not sore at all anymore what
15430.62 the hell like we didn't do anything
15431.939 different with the programming or really
15433.38 the nutrition but we got the rest of
15435.12 that allostatic load under control and
15437.52 boom things take off it's a lot like
15440.16 drivers so many people seem to be riding
15442.62 the brake and so many people seem to be
15444.3 heavy on the accelerator yeah that's
15446.16 actually one of the ways we describe it
15447.239 is like you want to go faster people's
15449.1 inclination step one is to hit the gas
15451.319 our our step number one is making sure
15453.42 your left foot's not on the brake you'll
15455.46 go faster with less resistance which
15457.26 means you'll actually wear down the
15458.699 system a lot slower by just taking your
15460.68 foot off the brake first if you're then
15462.18 not going fast enough now we can push
15463.5 the accelerator but I'm not pushing that
15465.18 accelerator while your foot's still on
15466.439 the brake you're going to go a little
15468.18 bit faster but not as fast as you should
15469.56 be going with that much work and you're
15471.42 going to start wearing down brake pedals
15473.04 and things like that so I like the
15474.359 analogy
15476.16 so hitting that 10 to 20
15479.279 sets per week repetition range is pretty
15482.76 broad provided you get close to failure
15484.26 hit failure every once in a while could
15485.76 be the final set of each exercise or
15488.22 maybe do one workout where you hit
15489.42 failure on everything but then you don't
15490.739 do it for a few more again there it
15492.479 sounds like there's a lot of play in the
15493.68 system here
15495.0 rest ranges anywhere from 30 seconds all
15498.359 the way up to three or four minutes
15499.5 depending on how heavy you're training
15501.12 and how close to failure or to failure
15503.64 maybe even quote unquote Beyond failure
15506.399 if there is such a thing you're training
15508.62 um throwing in negatives and things like
15510.0 that we didn't get into really high
15511.38 intensity techniques but people again
15513.84 vary in the extent to which they're
15515.46 pushing the system but
15517.56 there does seem to be some value to
15519.18 mixing up the
15521.04 rest between set ranges across exercises
15524.819 and across workouts but you could
15526.26 combine them all in the same workout as
15528.479 what I heard yep
15530.16 and then in terms of progression it
15533.46 sounds to me like the goal when
15535.199 hypertrophy training is not necessarily
15537.72 to add more weight to the bar although
15539.699 that's one way one could do it but that
15542.1 the progression actually can arrive
15544.319 through this really extensive kit of
15546.72 changing the speed of movement changing
15549.779 um the number of sets adding some volume
15551.66 maybe changing the split so that you go
15554.16 from a three day a week full body
15556.319 workout to more of a body parts one or
15560.76 two body parts per day every other day
15562.56 or two on one off at any number of
15564.479 different variations that are out there
15565.859 sounds like all of these can and will
15567.84 work provided that people
15569.52 are obeying the general principles of
15571.5 this uh hypertrophy adaptation inducing
15575.399 protocol that you described and that
15577.739 they are meeting the necessary but not
15579.66 sufficient variables as well
15582.12 such as sleep nutrition and managing the
15586.199 stress in the rest of their life
15588.479 do I have that correctly yeah that's
15590.699 really really good uh one more thing I'd
15592.979 like to add is this is a situation for
15595.5 hypertrophy in which there are some
15596.819 exercises
15597.899 that I actually don't think are good
15599.399 ideas so I want to make sure we included
15601.38 those in the conversation that's not
15603.239 necessarily the case for strength you
15605.399 can really do kind of whatever one you
15606.66 want and that is
15608.58 specifically Plyometrics although in
15611.279 fact if you look at there's a recent
15613.62 review paper came out showing that like
15615.12 Plyometrics are effective as well right
15617.279 just like one can do almost anything as
15619.859 long as it falls within this parameter
15621.66 set the concepts are few and the methods
15623.34 are many and the methods for hypertrophy
15625.199 are many many
15627.72 in general though Plyometrics are not my
15630.18 first second or even like 100th choice
15632.359 for hypertrophy they if they're a part
15635.1 of a total training program and you get
15636.479 some of our purchase as a result cool
15638.699 you're lucky not the first place I'm
15640.8 going the other major category are
15642.479 weightlifting variations so that when
15644.04 I'm saying weightlifting I mean
15645.12 specifically Olympic weightlifting as in
15647.279 Snatch clean and jerk and their
15648.6 variations those are just not a good
15650.22 exercise Choice it's not that they don't
15652.08 work
15653.16 it's just the risk to benefit ratio
15655.08 starts to fall pretty fast and in the
15657.42 negative favor and so it's just not
15659.1 worth doing sets of 10 of a snatch
15660.66 unless you're in a sport where that's
15662.399 like the competition or whatever but if
15663.84 the goal is simply hypertrophy choose
15666.18 different exercises than that great
15669.18 now I realize that we are going to do
15671.279 entire episodes related to nutrition
15673.38 supplementation recovery Etc but I'd
15675.84 like to just touch on two or three
15678.12 specific topics and questions that come
15680.52 up a lot around the
15683.64 question of hypertrophy specifically and
15686.58 that probably also relate to strength
15689.22 training and training for Speed
15691.62 so I'm going to ask these in
15693.54 um not rapid fire but I'll give you
15696.0 shorter answers we'll put it that way so
15697.5 I will ask these questions now but with
15699.0 the caveat that we will get into these
15700.979 topics in much more depth yeah very soon
15704.399 the first question is about the use of
15706.68 cold showers and Ice baths and cold
15708.72 water exposure which I know many people
15710.58 use for resilience training to increase
15712.979 their dopamine which it does
15715.26 and for recovery but
15718.08 there's also this issue of when one
15720.66 should use cold that is deliberate cold
15723.6 exposure relative to hypertrophy
15726.0 training specifically
15727.92 and
15729.3 that's because I've heard that if
15732.359 deliberate cold exposure is done too
15734.22 soon after a hypertrophy adaptation
15737.04 inducing workout yeah right all the
15739.68 sorts of things we've been talking about
15740.58 that the hypertrophy response can be
15743.16 blunted reduced or eliminated is that
15745.319 true and if so when could people do
15748.859 deliberate cold exposure while still
15751.14 also including hypertrophy training in
15752.76 their program and still get hypertrophy
15755.22 great so you know I'm a lover of the
15757.8 cold I still have a deep freezer in my
15761.04 house that is filled with water at all
15762.72 times that is plugged in and is a frozen
15764.64 chamber I still do the old school style
15766.62 of it please unplug it before you get in
15768.359 it oh yes absolutely and then don't do
15771.239 it by yourself so that the lid can close
15772.8 on top of you and then we don't see you
15774.239 sort of ever again the Han Solo effect
15776.819 it's time for me to upgrade and get one
15778.199 of these new fancy ones but I've been
15779.58 using this for so many years so I love
15781.26 it obviously I've been involved with xpt
15783.92 and and Gabby and Laird and Brian
15786.899 McKenzie and these folks so I've been
15788.399 doing this stuff for a long time I've
15789.72 but I don't even know how many hundreds
15791.52 of folks in the ice and a lot of reasons
15793.5 so there are a lot of benefits and we
15794.939 could talk about those later however
15797.1 that that being said it is very very
15799.26 true you do not want to get in the ice
15801.239 post hypertrophy training you wouldn't
15803.699 want to do that immediately after the
15804.84 workout you probably don't want to do it
15806.04 before the workout and you probably
15807.12 don't even want to do it that same day
15808.64 it's just not worth it it will blunt I
15811.8 apprecially in specifically we've talked
15813.42 earlier about what's driving muscle
15815.52 growth is that signaling Cascade through
15818.76 that gene expression through that muscle
15820.319 protein synthesis cold exposure blocks
15822.96 that signal
15824.22 remember adaptation comes from stress
15827.1 you've put in a stressor in now you've
15829.14 blocked that stress you've literally
15830.52 blocked this signal that tells your body
15832.8 come back and grow larger size so not a
15835.62 good idea to do it if you're training
15837.359 for some other purposes
15838.979 maybe strength maybe there's an argument
15841.319 there although maybe not for Speed and
15844.739 power maybe get away with the endurance
15846.18 maybe a separate conversation if you're
15848.399 in season
15849.72 I have no problem using it immediately
15851.64 after a game the goal is entirely
15853.739 different even if we did a hypertrophy
15855.18 type of training program we're not doing
15856.859 it try to try to maximize growth in that
15859.199 particular case our priority for
15861.66 Recovery is higher than our priority for
15864.0 muscle growth so we choose optimization
15866.16 in that category you can only make those
15868.92 choices though when you truly understand
15870.239 what is the goal for the day the week
15872.64 the month the phase of training and
15874.26 really what part of the year you're in
15875.58 we have that all plotted out for for all
15877.5 the people we work with so I know when
15879.359 we want to choose one over the other
15881.46 it's not a this is the choice you always
15883.14 make such a nation that's just not how
15884.819 we operate we need more Precision than
15887.1 that so that being said we're generally
15888.84 not going to do it if we want to do a
15891.239 lot of icing during a phase in which
15893.279 we're
15894.479 using a lot of hypertrophy we're going
15896.58 to do a couple of things number one we
15897.779 may just not use it so there are phases
15899.939 in our training where I don't want to
15901.62 maximize recovery
15903.239 I'm not going to give you any tricks
15904.739 here I'm not going to do ice or any of
15906.479 the other methods we're going to talk
15907.56 about why because the whole point is to
15910.739 cause overload that's what's going to be
15913.199 the stimuli to cause adaptation if all
15915.06 I'm doing is blocking that stuff
15916.439 attenuating it smashing it back down I'm
15918.6 undercutting myself I'm choosing to feel
15920.819 a little bit better to have a little bit
15922.8 better performance right now knowing
15925.199 that's going to compromise the results
15926.52 I'm going to get 6 8 10 12 weeks from
15928.979 now all right so I'm not going to choose
15930.54 it at all in reality of it is if I
15932.64 really am trying to maximize hypertrophy
15934.62 I'm probably not doing any ice work
15936.3 through that whole phase maybe like my
15938.399 off day I know that's similar to a setup
15940.319 you have like one day a week when I'm
15941.88 not training we'll jump in some ice
15943.68 maybe even do some hot cold contrast I
15946.739 love the xbc protocol it's you know
15948.84 you've probably talked about it before
15950.18 that's a great setup or just not do it
15953.819 at all right it's just not something we
15955.62 need when we move into another phase of
15958.14 training where we're trying to maximize
15959.76 adaptation or maximize the result and
15962.399 and get the benefit of that training now
15964.68 we're going to hedge more towards
15965.88 recovery and we're going to bring in
15967.319 some of these strategies and techniques
15968.88 and not worry about causing the most
15970.8 stimuli there because we're trying to
15971.939 add attenuator because we're trying to
15973.979 actualize the work we did 6 8 10 12
15976.56 weeks before what about cold showers do
15979.26 those have the same hypertrophy blunting
15981.239 effect in general no in general you can
15983.46 do cold showers that's not going to be a
15985.02 problem you're not going to be in there
15986.22 very long and you're not going to get
15987.3 nearly as cold as you will submerge in
15990.96 30 degree ice water for like that the
15993.6 way that we do it nonetheless so I have
15995.64 no problem standing in the shower for a
15997.26 couple of minutes using it for other
15999.18 reasons if you want to that's no issue
16001.22 I'd like to talk a little bit about
16002.72 nutrition and supplementation as it
16005.3 relates to hypertrophy
16008.3 Dr Lane Norton who's been a guest on the
16010.699 Hebrew and Lab podcast and we both know
16012.699 throughout a number range
16015.5 related to protein intake
16018.439 on the backdrop of how much protein
16020.359 synthesis can occur by meal across the
16023.42 day Etc
16024.859 a lot of a lot of research done there
16026.42 and some important work by him in
16027.739 particular and then the value that he
16029.779 threw out was
16031.3 1.6 grams
16033.92 per kilogram of body weight being the
16035.659 lower end of the range up to I believe
16038.18 is it was as high as 2.4 maybe even as
16040.46 high as 2.7 grams of protein per
16044.18 kilogram of body weight per day
16046.699 that's a pretty broad range but it's on
16048.8 the higher end of what I think most
16050.779 people think of in terms of protein
16052.22 intake and then again some people might
16054.38 already be right there or maybe even
16055.819 above that value now of course this all
16057.92 depends on whether or not people are
16059.06 omnivore vegan uh
16062.359 meat based Etc we won't even go there
16065.0 but assuming people are getting enough
16067.279 protein per day so somewhere in that
16069.199 range and they are spreading out that
16071.42 protein intake
16073.279 to accommodate the fact that the body
16075.92 can only assimilate a certain amount of
16078.02 protein in any given sitting
16080.06 what do you like to see people ingest at
16083.779 some point post hypertrophy inducing
16086.779 workout in order to
16089.72 get
16091.1 the protein synthesis
16092.96 Advantage if you will yeah that is
16095.3 stimulated by that workout
16097.52 earlier you mentioned the you know the
16099.38 post-training feeding window that you
16101.359 know in the 90s and probably earlier
16102.92 people were talking about oh you know
16103.939 within the first 90 minutes you have to
16105.439 get 30 amounts for a while yeah was it
16107.479 30 minutes of excuse me a certain number
16109.819 of grams of carbohydrate and protein Etc
16111.8 I think now the understanding is that
16113.659 that window is much broader
16116.239 um and how broad and Etc is still a
16119.3 matter of debate but
16121.04 when somebody is training specifically
16122.84 for hypertrophy assuming they are
16124.819 getting enough protein from quality
16126.199 sources in their other meals
16128.18 and assuming that their overall
16130.12 macronutrient intake and caloric intake
16132.8 is high enough that is they have enough
16134.54 of a caloric Surplus that they have the
16136.64 the raw materials for
16138.8 for hypertrophy
16141.439 what do you like to see people ingest at
16144.68 some point post-workout in order to
16146.84 facilitate muscle protein synthesis and
16148.939 recovery and this could include
16150.5 nutrition and supplementation or if you
16152.479 want to divide those answers out feel
16154.819 free to do so of course yeah okay great
16156.199 so a ton of work came out of Don
16158.239 Layman's lab it was actually a Lane's
16159.92 Mentor as well as Stu Phillips at
16162.08 McMaster so a ton of work there and we
16164.239 can answer a number of things here so
16166.279 Lane's numbers that he recommended uh
16168.62 also known as about a gram of protein
16170.84 per pound of body weight it's a great
16172.279 start now once you slide below per pound
16175.22 right one gram per pound right in
16177.319 earlier which is also making sure
16178.88 because we're changing units here uh it
16180.56 was 1.6 grams per kilogram of body
16183.8 weight all the way up to I think it was
16186.08 2.4 but maybe a size 2.7 yeah grams of
16189.5 protein per kilogram of body weight so
16191.18 2.2 in that unit would be the same thing
16193.819 so 200 grams per kilogram is the same as
16195.68 one gram per pound right so depending on
16197.479 which where you're listening at to this
16199.399 at one of those may be easier than the
16201.38 other for you if you start getting below
16204.319 that number
16205.34 now you do start running into questions
16207.439 of protein quality protein type and
16209.6 protein timing this is one of the
16211.52 reasons why I actually fully agree with
16213.02 Lane is just get that number higher than
16215.359 you think and then all those other
16216.739 variables don't matter if that number is
16219.14 low then you need to start paying
16220.52 attention to a bunch of other stuff
16221.6 you've added now complexity to your
16223.76 program things you got to pay attention
16225.56 to just stay high and it doesn't matter
16227.779 and so you can just leave a lot of those
16229.22 things off the table
16230.659 that seems to be fairly clear in the
16232.819 work of some of this gentlemen I just
16234.08 mentioned that as long as you get to
16235.399 that total number the question about
16237.02 timing and types and quality it seems to
16240.14 matter a lot less in fact uh Stu's
16242.12 recent work in non-animal-based proteins
16244.699 it really showed that to be fairly clear
16246.68 that those are quite effective assuming
16248.239 total protein intake is high enough the
16251.479 amount of leucine and other amino acids
16253.279 in those actual proteins matter less if
16255.56 the total threshold is just super high
16257.12 so just do that and you're fine now the
16260.0 other caveat we have to say here is
16261.68 timing of macronutrients is seems to be
16264.68 somewhat Irrelevant for protein but that
16266.42 is not the case for carbohydrates so
16269.06 that timing does matter replenishment of
16271.1 muscle glycogen is very specific and you
16273.8 want to make sure that that is around a
16275.779 lot if you're doing either maintaining
16277.58 training quality or you're sliding into
16279.62 endurance type of work and so nutrient
16281.479 timing does matter with carbohydrates
16283.399 maybe less so with protein and certainly
16286.04 less so with protein if the total
16287.42 protein ingestion is high enough so um
16291.199 it depends on what we're going after in
16293.12 terms of a training goal and where we
16296.0 want to get with all these things in
16297.38 general the way that we like to think
16298.46 about this is
16299.779 if you're doing a strength type of work
16301.939 where you're truly targeting that then a
16304.22 one-to-one post exercise protein to
16306.859 carbohydrate ratio is generally what
16308.479 we're going to go after so this would be
16309.62 something like 35 grams of protein and
16311.54 35 grams of carbohydrate it doesn't have
16314.18 to be post it can be pre or my favorite
16316.52 is actually mid or post but somewhere in
16319.52 that range especially if you're training
16321.14 in the morning and you have not consumed
16322.939 anything prior to your workout and
16324.62 that's not necessarily eating in the
16325.88 middle of the workout that's drinking
16327.319 calories yeah yeah it's going to be able
16329.659 to see someone eating a sandwich on uh
16331.699 in the gym although I'm sure it's
16333.02 happened yeah so one to one is that like
16335.84 sort of standard number here
16338.18 um if you're going to do sort of more of
16340.34 a really hard conditioning workout that
16342.68 number slides up to something like three
16344.659 or even four to one which would be
16346.34 carbohydrate to protein ratio so if we
16348.62 want to stay at 35 grams of protein
16350.239 we're going to go maybe as high as like
16351.739 100 or 140 grams of carbohydrate again
16354.739 depending on what type of of training
16356.96 we're sort of doing if you're going to
16358.34 do a little bit of a combination then
16360.439 you like a little bit of strength a
16361.88 little bit of conditioning and kind of a
16363.14 standard workout which is probably
16364.399 something that a lot of people will do
16365.72 then you maybe want to go to something
16367.159 like two to one so you know 35 grams of
16370.279 protein 60 70 grams of carbohydrate and
16373.46 those are kind of just like rough
16374.54 numbers that you can go by
16376.399 and for Pure hypertrophy training would
16379.64 you like to see people ingest some
16381.02 carbohydrate post-training for Pure
16383.18 hypertrophy training
16384.92 I want to see that as many of those
16387.02 nutrients around the training is
16388.641 generally possible now again I might
16390.26 change my mind when our fasting study
16391.82 comes out but as it stands now
16394.52 there is no advantage to not fueling
16398.18 around the training and there are some
16401.119 known and some other potential
16402.5 advantages to fueling so I just see no
16404.719 reason to not do it
16406.52 um in fact
16407.719 most people are generally going to do
16409.641 better now this is not science this is
16411.74 just my coaching experience and this is
16414.141 with our athletes and all of our
16415.52 non-athletes that we've worked with and
16417.32 do work with they're just going to be
16419.061 better spreading those meals out
16420.199 generally throughout the day and they're
16422.6 going to be better if they have those
16424.1 nutrients either pre-mid or post and so
16426.68 they're going to get even for my Purge
16428.299 fee they're going to get something like
16429.619 that one three to one ratio of carbs to
16431.6 protein
16433.039 personal preference some people don't
16434.539 like to eat before they train some
16435.74 people have to eat before they train
16437.0 some people can't you know put in food
16439.641 in their belly immediately after work
16441.74 around that you can you can play based
16443.119 on personal preference but we want that
16444.439 fueling in there because we want to
16446.779 maximize the potential growth and we
16448.279 want to just get a jump start on
16449.6 recovery because we're going to be
16450.98 training again pretty soon
16453.199 supplementation is a huge topic and one
16455.719 that we will go into in great depth in a
16459.219 soon to occur episode but if you had to
16463.279 pick one supplement that can benefit
16466.34 most everybody if not everybody yeah
16469.58 for their training directed toward
16471.58 strength power and hypertrophy what
16474.379 would that supplement be and how would
16475.82 you like to see people use it meaning
16477.5 how much should they take and when
16480.32 should they take it sure if you don't
16482.299 count protein and carbohydrates as
16484.1 supplements they technically are but
16485.779 we'll just walk out of it right sorry I
16487.641 I should be more specific I'm not
16489.26 referring to a non-food form
16492.799 um protein and carbohydrates so powdered
16495.32 protein and part of powdered
16496.82 carbohydrate Etc
16498.619 um technically are supplements they're
16500.18 highly processed but they're um but I'm
16502.279 not including that I'm I'm referring to
16504.619 um non-macronutrient type supplements
16506.779 yeah does testosterone count
16510.08 um well in the context of this
16511.879 discussion it's uh testosterone that
16513.68 people are manufacturing themselves ah
16515.66 okay the cheating kind the endogenous
16517.279 kind no
16518.18 um I mean creatine is the answer here
16520.039 without question it is the most well
16523.459 studied it is the most effective and its
16526.459 uh benefits are robust meaning they're
16529.039 going to confer positive adaptations
16532.219 across multiple physiological domains
16534.68 and we can certainly have a very long
16536.18 chat about some of the interesting
16538.58 things that people in fact we just had
16540.26 um during candel
16541.699 um on our Barbershop podcast and he went
16543.619 into extensive detail about all the
16545.539 benefits of creatine that people have no
16547.1 idea about including things like bone
16548.779 mineral density you asked about that
16550.641 earlier creatine is actually fairly
16552.199 effective for that let alone the thing
16554.92 the benefit in things like cognitive
16557.24 function decision making memory
16559.641 um the work that that's being done there
16561.141 for
16562.279 neurological disorders
16564.561 um depression a whole host of things
16567.141 that that creatine is being studied for
16568.641 some of those studies show a lot of
16571.641 benefits some of it show maybe a little
16573.08 bit some none but there's just a lot of
16575.359 things creatine can do so when we could
16577.52 talk about Muscle Recovery or muscle
16579.08 hypertrophy
16580.699 um that's where the bulk of the research
16582.799 is and it and it's very effective in
16585.379 terms of
16586.58 type creatine monohydrate is still the
16589.459 best one and that's just because it has
16590.66 the largest evidence base you can maybe
16593.359 make some arguments for some other types
16594.92 but you're really going to reach
16595.939 saturation pretty quickly within a
16597.92 matter of weeks and there add a dosage
16600.26 of anywhere between like three to six
16601.58 grams per day now five grams is the very
16605.24 standard number we give reality is I
16608.119 change that number based on size that's
16610.1 just the honest truth
16611.779 um if you're 225 pounds you're not going
16614.18 to get the same dosage of creatine as
16615.68 125 pound girl that's just like this is
16618.199 not what we're going to do so we may
16619.52 slide that number down a little bit
16620.539 closer to three for the the smaller girl
16622.58 boy it doesn't matter it's just female
16623.9 physical size if you're one of our 275
16626.719 or 330 pound offensive right tackles in
16629.9 the NFL you're not going to get the same
16631.76 dosage as everybody else so that number
16633.26 is going to go up to seven eight nine
16634.52 maybe even 10 grams a day I'm there so
16636.379 that's just kind of the scale in general
16637.641 if you wanted an easy answer five grams
16639.439 is the standard taken after training the
16642.98 timing doesn't matter totally irrelevant
16644.9 take it in the morning of breakfast take
16646.039 it at night take it anytime you want
16647.18 take it pre we tend to put it in a lot
16649.34 of people's workout
16651.799 um shakes just to make sure they get it
16654.439 in throughout the day but the timing is
16655.641 irrelevant great well thank you for that
16657.92 very informative answer and I look
16659.299 forward to much more discussion about
16661.82 nutrition and supplementation and
16663.561 recovery and all the rest in the
16665.719 episodes to come this was incredibly
16667.879 informative thank you so very much I
16671.18 appreciate the opportunity I had a great
16673.1 time doing that I love talking about
16674.6 these things I also really like talking
16676.699 about what we're going to get into in
16678.379 our next conversation which is the
