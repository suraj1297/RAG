0.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the Huberman Lab podcast, where
2.458 we discuss science and science
based tools for everyday life.
6.421 [MUSIC PLAYING]
9.13 I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor
10.9 of neurobiology
and ophthalmology
13.06 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.77 Today we are
discussing creativity.
17.23 Creativity is a topic that to
many people is very abstract.
21.31 That is, we know when something
seems creative, some of us
25.33 know people who are creative
or perhaps are creative,
28.57 and yet the ability to be
creative resides in everybody.
32.619 And we know that because
the neural circuits
34.72 that underlie creativity
have been somewhat defined
38.2 and the steps and processes
within the brain and body that
41.08 lead to creativity
are well known.
43.57 That said, most people don't
know how to access creativity.
47.45 And if they do know how
to access creativity,
49.66 they are only able
to access creativity
51.61 in a fairly limited
number of domains of life.
54.04 For instance, in the visual arts
or in music or within science
58.75 or engineering or any number
of different domains ranging
62.08 from the kitchen to sport
to childhood interactions.
67.21 That is, childhood games.
69.14 In other words, some
adults are able to access
71.35 their creative spirit when
engaging in childlike play
74.14 with children or for
that matter with adults.
77.23 But as it turns out,
all of creativity
79.99 stems from just a small
subset of neural structures
82.6 in the brain that
need to be activated
84.85 in a particular
sequence or order.
86.68 Today we will talk about what
those neural structures are,
89.17 what particular order they need
to be activated in in order
92.38 to come up with, for instance,
new ideas that are creative,
95.65 and then how to implement
those creative strategies.
99.13 We will also talk
about different ways
100.93 to access creativity
that include--
103.24 narrative and storytelling as
well as applying new rule sets
107.26 or even entirely new worldviews.
109.12 And we will do this in
a structured way that
111.55 will allow anyone, whether
or not you consider yourself
114.07 creative or not to
be able to apply
116.74 these tools in different domains
of life-- work, family, play,
120.55 and on and on.
121.66 By the end of
today's episode, you
123.22 will have a better understanding
of what creativity is
126.73 and how to access it.
128.479 And if you like to bring others
into your creative endeavors
132.61 which as you'll soon
learn can massively
135.43 expand the extent to
which you yourself
137.77 can express your
creative talents.
139.69 As is the case with all episodes
of the Huberman Lab podcast,
142.93 today we will discuss
both scientific mechanisms
145.63 and nomenclature.
146.56 And I promise to make
all of that clear to you
148.483 even if you don't have
a background in biology
150.4 or psychology.
151.63 But we will also, of
course, discuss tools.
153.97 That is, specific steps
that you can take in order
156.31 to be more creative.
157.42 One particular tool that I'm
excited to share with you
159.91 involves a meditation, but this
is a very unusual meditation.
163.81 This is not sitting with eyes
closed focusing on your breath
166.66 or focusing on a chime
or some other feature
169.6 in your sensory environment
or even in your body.
171.97 Later we will talk about
open monitoring meditations.
175.75 Open monitoring meditations are
very distinct from other forms
179.08 of meditation and
involve learning
181.51 how to sit back
and simply observe
184.09 your thoughts
while intentionally
186.7 varying where your thoughts go.
188.69 So for those of you
that find it a struggle
191.17 to focus or to refocus in more
traditional forms of meditation
194.98 or maybe even in your work
and even for those of you that
197.92 may suffer from things
like ADHD or similar,
201.67 open monitoring meditation can
be an extremely valuable tool
205.21 for accessing your
creative abilities.
206.973 Because of the
ways that it allows
208.39 you to tap into
specific circuits
210.4 within the frontal
networks of your brain,
212.18 so these are networks
of the brain that
213.805 include the areas just
behind your forehead
216.4 and that allow you to evaluate
new and novel rule sets
220.51 in a very unconstrained way.
221.892 Because if you think
about it, creativity
223.6 is really the ability to
take existing elements
226.12 from the physical world or from
the thought world, if you will,
230.05 or from any domain of life,
mood, thinking, and information
234.85 and to reorder those into
novel combinations that
238.0 are useful for something.
239.71 And as we'll also
find out later,
241.27 creativity has this
incredible aspect to it,
243.8 which is that when we see or
create or experience something
248.38 that is truly creative,
it reveals to us something
251.8 fundamental about the way
that the natural world
254.44 and indeed the way
that our brains work.
256.959 If that sounds very mysterious
and abstract to you now,
259.3 I promise that by the
end of today's episode,
261.529 you will not only
understand what that means
263.47 but you will also understand
how to use open monitoring
266.32 meditations as well as other
forms of tools in order
269.86 to access your creative ability.
271.45 Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize
273.162 that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research
275.62 roles at Stanford.
276.64 It is however part of
my desire and effort
278.74 to bring zero cost to
consumer information
280.69 about science and
science related tools
282.64 to the general public.
283.84 In keeping with
that theme, I'd like
285.34 to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.
287.75 Our first sponsor is ROKA.
289.39 ROKA makes eyeglasses
and sunglasses
291.55 that are the absolute
highest quality.
293.463 The company was founded by
two All-American swimmers
295.63 from Stanford and everything
about ROKA eyeglasses
298.27 and sunglasses were designed
with performance in mind.
301.117 I've spent a lifetime
working on the biology
302.95 of the visual system.
303.77 And I can tell you that
your visual system has
305.687 to contend with an enormous
number of challenges for you
308.087 to be able to see clearly.
309.17 For instance, when you move from
a shady area to a sunny area.
312.23 There are all
adaptations that have
313.82 to occur in your eye and brain.
315.44 ROKA understands
these adaptations.
317.96 And the other ones
required to see clearly.
319.87 And those are built into the
engineering of their sunglasses
322.37 and eyeglasses.
323.24 One of the things that makes
ROKA eyeglasses in sunglasses
325.79 so terrific, is that they
are extremely lightweight.
328.167 In fact, most of the
time I don't even
329.75 realize that they're on my face.
331.083 I wear sunglasses when
I drive and whenever
333.02 I need to throughout the day
and I wear readers at night.
335.75 I do not wear sunglasses when I
get my morning sunlight, which
339.29 I do every single morning
as you should be doing also
342.5 as is covered many
times on this podcast.
344.6 ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses
are also unique in that
347.27 unlike a lot of so-called
performance eyeglasses
349.34 out there.
350.12 They don't make you
look like a cyborg.
351.77 They have some of
the styles that
353.06 make you look like a cyborg,
if that's your thing.
355.143 But if you want to wear
glasses or sunglasses out
358.28 to dinner or around
for social reasons,
360.98 they have many different
aesthetic styles
362.75 to choose from.
363.5 If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses or sunglasses,
365.75 go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A
.com and enter the code
369.05 Huberman to save
20% off your order.
371.33 Again, that's ROKA, roka.com
and enter the code Huberman
375.11 at checkout.
375.71 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Thesis.
378.2 Thesis makes custom nootropics.
380.24 And as you may have
heard me say before,
381.95 I am not a fan of
the word nootropics
383.9 because it means smart drugs.
385.28 And frankly, there
is no neural circuit
387.38 in the brain for being
quote unquote "smart."
390.08 There are neural
circuits for focus.
391.64 There are neural circuits
for task switching.
393.68 There are neural circuits
for today's topic,
396.36 which is creativity.
397.97 Nootropics therefore
is not a great word
400.7 to describe any
supplement or drug that
403.22 can enhance brain function
because it lacks specificity.
406.55 Thesis understands
this and therefore has
408.68 designed custom nootropics
that are tailored
410.99 to your specific needs and that
allow you to enter the brain
414.29 and bodily states that are
optimal for things like focus,
416.99 energy, creativity, and so on.
419.29 If you'd like to try your own
personalized nootropic starter
421.79 kit, go online to take
thesis.com/Huberman.
424.79 Take their brief
three minute quiz.
426.29 And Thesis will send you
four different formulas
428.29 to try in your first month.
429.44 Again, that's take
thesis.com/huberman and use
432.44 the code Huberman at checkout
for 10% off your first box.
435.68 Today's episode is also
brought to us by LMNT.
438.085 LMNT is an
electrolyte drink that
439.46 contains everything you need
that is sodium, magnesium,
443.04 and potassium in
the precise ratios
444.92 that you need without sugar.
447.02 As I talked about many
times before on this podcast
449.15 and elsewhere, every
cell in your body
451.64 requires hydration
and electrolytes
454.04 in order to function properly.
455.45 And a key example of this are
the neurons, the nerve cells
457.943 of your brain that allow
you to think clearly,
459.86 to exercise hard, et cetera.
462.2 Neurons require sodium
in order to fire
464.455 what are called
action potentials
465.83 or electrical signaling
between neurons.
467.93 And they require
potassium and magnesium.
469.85 And those have to be present
in the correct ratios in order
472.73 for your brain and body
to function optimally.
474.86 LMNT is formulated
to help anyone
476.66 with their electrolyte needs.
477.92 And is perfectly suited
to anyone following
480.56 a ketogenic, low carbohydrate,
or Paleolithic diet,
483.41 or a basic omnivore diet which
is the one that I follow.
486.68 If you'd like to try LMNT,
you can go to drink element
489.11 that's lmnt.com/huberman to
claim a free element sample
493.1 pack with your purchase.
494.24 And right now LMNT has
two special flavors
496.16 for the holidays--
chocolate caramel and mint
498.53 chocolate, which I should
mention taste especially good
501.41 if you actually heat it up.
503.01 So if you treat it
like a tea, it works.
505.82 Or if you drink it
cold it's delicious.
507.59 All the flavors of
LMNT I find delicious.
510.0 Again, you can go
to drink element,
511.76 that's lmnt.com/Huberman.
514.61 The Huberman Lab
podcast is now partnered
516.409 with Momentous supplements.
517.58 To find the supplements we
discuss on the Huberman Lab
519.83 podcast, you can go to
livemomentous spelled
522.049 O-U-S, livemomentous/huberman.
525.01 And I should just
mention that the Library
526.76 of those supplements is
constantly expanding.
528.89 Again, that's
livemomentous.com/huberman.
531.95 Let's talk about creativity.
533.66 Now on the face of it, the word
creativity and creative acts
537.32 might seem somewhat
abstract to us.
539.27 That is, we know
when we see something
541.67 that we consider creative and
we know when we see something
545.3 that is not creative.
546.74 Things that aren't
creative are things
548.33 that we see every day, a car
with four tires, for instance,
551.66 a bicycle with two
tires, not creative.
555.23 However, we also see things that
are novel that are different
559.013 and that we don't really
think of as creative.
560.93 In fact, they can be
downright trivial.
563.12 For instance, if I were
to take a fish tank
565.61 and put wings on it,
that's a novel combination
569.69 of things, which is
one of the key criteria
572.36 for an act or an object
or a piece of music
576.62 that is creative.
577.76 And yet, neither of
us I believe would
580.52 find it very creative
or very interesting
582.74 that a fish tank
has wings on it.
584.12 Why or why not I should say?
586.44 Well, it turns out
that for something
588.47 to be creative it actually
has to reveal to us something
591.08 fundamental about the
world or about how we work.
594.81 And I must say that oftentimes
the most creative and the most
598.34 interesting and the most
beloved creative acts
601.52 reveal to us something
fundamental about the world
603.95 or the way that we work in a
way that delights and thrills
606.83 and surprise prizes us but
that we aren't even aware what
609.95 that fundamental rule is.
611.208 I'll return to this
in a few minutes.
612.75 But for the time being,
let's just build up
616.01 from first principles what
constitutes something creative
618.71 and what does not constitute
something creative.
622.154 Creativity is a way of
interacting with the world
624.98 or combining or recombining
things in the world
627.53 in a way that appears novel
to us and to other people.
631.64 My example of a fish tank
with wings on it is novel.
635.57 But frankly, it's
not very creative
637.37 and it's not very interesting.
639.02 It doesn't reveal
anything new to us.
641.72 Sure there are flying fish
although they just jump far,
644.81 they don't really fly.
646.02 And as a consequence,
putting wings on a fish tank
648.92 could be used as a metaphor for
the fact that fish don't fly.
651.643 But you already
knew and I already
653.06 knew that fish don't fly.
654.44 And so there's
nothing novel revealed
656.18 to us about the world except
something we already knew.
659.27 Now, creative acts on the
other hand, of course,
662.15 involve novel combinations
of existing rule sets that
666.02 could be different combinations
of music or colors or shapes
669.08 or technology, et cetera.
672.41 But it does so in a way
that tells us something
675.35 fundamental and different.
677.33 Let me give an example of a few
truly creative artistic acts.
681.53 And I'll do that in the domain
of visual arts but, of course,
685.393 there are many
examples that could
686.81 come from music or from other
domains sport, et cetera.
690.23 The examples I'll give rather
than a fish tank with wings
693.59 are for instance, the
comparison between a drawing
698.39 or a very accurate painting
of a face, an Escher
704.06 painting, and a Banksy.
706.79 If you don't know what
those are I'll explain.
709.31 First of all, let's talk about
an accurate representation
712.43 of a face.
713.21 If I were to sit
you down or if you
714.92 were to send me a
photograph and then
716.9 I were to paint
or draw a picture
719.03 of your face in a way that
faithfully represented,
722.21 the position and shape of your
nose relative to the eyes,
725.18 maybe a curl of the
lip, maybe a few hairs
729.41 of your eyebrows in a
particular way, that
731.66 really captured you accurately.
734.06 I think most people would
say, OK, it's accurate.
736.97 It looks a lot like the
photograph or the person.
739.04 And on the one hand why
that could be interesting
742.31 it's not particularly
creative because it faithfully
744.95 represents what's already there.
747.77 In contrast, a painting or
a picture like an Escher,
751.28 and for those of you that aren't
familiar with Escher's involves
754.31 a lot of repeating patterns.
755.58 So for instance, a bird image
that's repeated over and over
758.54 and over and over
again, sometimes
760.13 in partially overlapping manner.
762.47 And perhaps a building
that's repeated over and over
765.47 and over again or stones
repeated over and over again
767.78 or staircases over
and over again.
770.27 Escher's capture elements
from the outside world
774.62 and faithfully represent them,
but faithfully represent them
777.62 over and over and over again,
which is not typically seen
780.23 in the natural world.
781.14 In fact, most of what
our visual system does
783.83 is to eliminate repetitive
patterns when we see them.
787.02 In fact, most of what
our visual system does
788.96 is try and make us blind
to repetitive patterns
791.45 in our visual
environment and only
793.43 allow us to see things
that are unusual
795.65 in that visual environment.
797.27 Now, this is especially
true at visual scales.
801.092 What I mean by that is if
you were to go to the beach
803.3 and lie on your towel and
look down at the sand,
805.55 you would start to notice
that the sand is a very, very
808.34 repetitive pattern.
809.18 So at very small scales and in
particular at molecular scales
812.15 when you get down to the
level of atoms and so forth,
814.97 everything is repetitive.
816.075 It's the same thing,
is just reproduced
817.7 in different combinations
over and over again.
819.32 But as we move
through our world,
820.61 typically we're not looking
down at pebbles on the ground
822.985 or little grains of sand
or the pattern of leaves
826.73 in a particular clover or
something of that sort.
828.973 Most of the time
we're looking out
830.39 on landscapes or at
people's faces, et cetera.
832.94 And very seldom do we see
highly repetitive patterns
837.41 at that scale.
838.65 So what Escher's do
is they essentially
840.8 reveal to us a
fundamental feature
842.81 about the way that our
visual system works,
844.98 which is that repetitive
patterns tend to become noise
849.17 in our visual system.
850.1 That is, our brain encodes
repetition as things
853.16 not to be interested in.
854.69 And the things that stand
out against that repetition
857.18 as the things to be interested
in so-called signal to noise.
860.45 What Escher's do is they invert
the relationship between signal
863.66 and noise and they make the
repetitive patterns the signal
866.72 and the unusual
patterns the noise.
869.54 In fact, in every Escher
there are unusual patterns
871.76 and those completely
disappear to us.
873.56 Now, when you look at an
Escher, what you probably see
875.81 and what I see are just a bunch
of birds repeated over and over
878.435 again or buildings or staircases
repeated over and over again.
881.17 And you may like
Escher's and you may not,
882.92 that's not the point.
883.88 Today we're not
talking about taste
885.5 in particular creative acts.
887.12 What we're trying
to identify here
888.8 are the rules and mechanisms
of what constitutes something
891.65 creative and why it's creative.
893.42 And the key element here is that
what's revealed by an Escher
896.87 through these
repetition patterns
899.36 is an inversion of the way
that our brain normally
901.55 encodes visual images.
902.96 And therefore, the
rule that repetition
906.11 is suppressed in
our visual system
908.78 and that unusual visual features
are revealed to us, that rule
914.48 is what pops out to us
when we look at an Escher.
916.853 Now, when I say pops out I don't
mean that you look at an Escher
919.52 and go oh, normally I
don't see repetition,
921.59 normally I see the unusual
stuff, et cetera, et cetera.
924.2 But there seems to be something
about truly creative acts
927.26 that capture the attention.
929.03 And sometimes the delight
of many, many people
931.67 is that they reveal a
fundamental rule about how
934.34 the brain or the world works.
936.3 Let me give you a
different example
938.46 also from the visual art world.
940.29 Let me give you the
example of Banksy.
942.11 Banksy is an artist that many of
you are probably familiar with
945.5 and probably some of you
are not familiar with.
947.69 So for those of you that are
not familiar with Banksy,
949.94 Banksy is an artist
that most often
952.49 does two dimensional artwork.
953.9 So these would be stencils
or paintings or drawings
956.75 like many artists and does
them in an urban landscape,
959.93 an actual city or
suburban landscape.
963.41 That is, he draws or stencils or
graffiti in a very cryptic way,
968.04 I should say.
968.84 No one really knows who Banksy
is or when he does his art.
971.54 He just reveals his
art by putting it up.
973.25 But he does this in
the context of cities
975.8 and on three
dimensional objects.
977.64 So a good example would be he
will stencil next to a phone
981.62 booth a police officer.
983.39 Or he will graffiti next
to an actual fire hydrant
987.23 a dog lifting its leg to
urinate on that fire hydrant.
990.56 Now, what's interesting about
Banksy's is not simply the fact
994.67 that he puts two dimensional art
onto three dimensional surfaces
997.97 in the urban and
suburban landscape
1000.03 because if you think
about it, that's been
1001.78 done many, many times before.
1003.07 All graffiti is that.
1004.45 All City Art and murals is that.
1008.05 So what's unique about Banksy?
1009.88 What's unique about
Banksy or I should
1012.76 say Banksy's, the actual
art, is that he combines
1016.66 two dimensional art with a three
dimensional landscape in a way
1021.34 that the concept
pops out at you.
1024.292 What do I mean by that?
1025.25 Well, in the case of
the dog lifting its leg
1027.083 to urinate on the fire hydrant,
that's a scene that most people
1029.77 and in fact, most children are
familiar with from cartoons
1032.2 or from our basic understanding
of the stereotype of dogs
1034.575 and I must tell you having
owned a male dog, a bulldog
1037.66 Costello for many years.
1040.089 Hydrants were a particular
target for Costello.
1042.595 Of course, everything
was a particular target
1044.47 for Costello urinating outdoors.
1046.569 Nonetheless, he liked
to pee on fire hydrants.
1049.33 That itself is not interesting.
1051.1 Seeing a photograph of
a dog raising its leg
1053.65 to pee on a fire hydrant
is not interesting.
1057.04 Seeing a painting of
that isn't interesting.
1059.8 Seeing an actual dog
urinating on a fire hydrant
1062.2 isn't interesting.
1063.16 In fact, seeing a painting in
two dimensions of a dog raising
1067.87 its leg to, of course,
it can't actually
1070.51 urinate but give you the
impression that it would
1073.33 urinate on that fire
hydrant isn't particularly
1075.85 interesting except for the fact
that it reveals to us something
1078.58 fundamental, which
is that we tend
1080.32 to pair visual relationships
between different objects
1084.1 that share a common
theme and then
1086.62 the theme tends to pop out us.
1087.975 So, for instance,
the dog raising
1089.35 its leg next to a
fire hydrant even
1090.928 if the dog is drawn
in two dimensions
1092.47 and the fire hydrant
is in three dimensions
1094.39 allows the concept of
dog and fire hydrant
1097.12 to emerge or pop out at us,
which reveals to us something
1100.21 fundamental about
how our brain works,
1102.08 which is that our brain encodes
concepts and entire stories
1105.91 as symbols of interaction
between different objects.
1109.583 Let me give you a
different example just
1111.25 to make sure that
this hits home.
1113.86 One of Banksy's more
famous paintings
1116.05 is a rather politically
charged one,
1118.06 which is of a girl holding
a bouquet of balloons.
1122.65 And this two dimensional drawing
was put on to the West wall
1127.21 dividing territories
in the Middle East.
1130.03 A very controversial issue.
1131.752 The controversies
of that issue are
1133.21 not what I want to get into.
1134.2 But I don't think
anyone would doubt
1135.76 that is a controversial issue.
1138.1 The two dimensional
drawing of the girl
1139.9 with the balloons
on the actual wall
1143.05 turns out to be quite
interesting as an art piece
1146.92 because what it reveals to
us is the entire controversy
1150.4 around the presence of
that wall and the desire
1152.86 for certain people to breach
that wall and the desire
1155.23 for other people to insist
that that wall not be breached
1157.967 for whatever reason.
1158.8 Again, this is not about
the particular controversy,
1161.08 the point is that a two
dimensional image combined
1164.08 with a three
dimensional structure
1165.88 allows the purpose of that
three dimensional structure.
1169.96 And the controversy around that
three dimensional structure
1172.75 to pop out at us in a way that
if, for instance, we had just
1176.47 seen a photograph of
somebody next to that wall
1179.65 or with a ladder
or if we just seen
1181.6 a drawing of a girl holding
a bouquet of balloons
1185.86 on a drawing of that
wall to not emerge.
1188.47 In other words, it captures
two fundamental features
1190.715 of the visual system.
1191.59 Our ability to encode
things in two dimensions
1193.81 and understand symbols.
1195.16 And our ability to understand
things in three dimensions.
1197.855 And in particular, the wall
as a three dimensional object
1200.23 is really interesting
because it's
1202.45 an actual physical barrier.
1204.11 So showing it as the
actual physical barrier
1206.23 that it is in real space,
in three dimensions
1209.17 turns out to allow the
interaction between those two
1212.3 things.
1212.8 The concept, the controversy
to pop out at us and make us
1216.61 think about that particular
controversy and perhaps
1218.8 where we each individually
stand on that controversy.
1221.98 Now, there are many
examples of what I just
1224.26 gave in the visual domain.
1226.12 For instance, Rothko's
which are just
1228.7 color on Canvas are
particularly interesting source
1232.3 of information about the way
that the brain encodes color.
1235.03 Later I'll fill in exactly
what that information is.
1237.7 You may like
Rothko's, you may not.
1239.233 But I'll tell you one thing.
1240.4 When you look at
a Rothko, you are
1242.95 seeing colors in a
very different way
1245.11 than you would ever see
colors in any other context.
1247.87 The fact that they don't
have a frame typically
1250.36 and the fact that
there's no white canvas
1253.78 allows the colors
that you see to be
1255.85 novel hues of those
colors that you will not
1258.49 see in any other context.
1260.29 And in doing so
reveals to you what
1263.62 your brain does in order to
understand and extract color.
1267.58 Now in the context of
music, for instance,
1269.8 you will sometimes hear a
street musician play a song
1273.28 maybe a Bob Dylan song or a Led
Zeppelin song or a Pink Floyd
1276.13 song pretty closely, pretty
accurately to the way
1278.987 that song is played.
1279.82 But, of course,
that's not creative.
1280.87 That's just like the photograph
or the accurate portrait
1283.203 of somebody's face.
1284.05 Or you may hear an
acoustic version
1286.0 of what's normally an electric
guitar song or electrical song
1289.51 or vise versa.
1290.59 Somewhat creative,
sometimes sounds
1292.48 even better than the original
but not particularly creative.
1295.03 However, each and
every one of us
1297.31 has a particular taste in music.
1298.93 Maybe it's classical, maybe
it's rock, maybe it's punk,
1301.222 maybe it's hip hop.
1302.43 Within each of those
genres, I think all of us
1305.07 are familiar with hearing
something for the first time
1308.52 and maybe even every time.
1310.11 And there's something
about the combination
1312.42 of the words and the
music or sometimes
1315.15 just the music or just the words
that allows some feature of it
1318.78 to pop out at us as
particularly exciting.
1322.17 And when we feel that
excitement and we
1323.91 feel that it's
really novel, it's
1325.47 different than what we've
heard before, I assure you
1327.78 what it's revealing
to you is the way
1330.12 that your auditory
system and often
1332.01 your auditory and
your emotional system
1334.11 encodes information
that you hear.
1336.96 And again, the rule
that it's revealing
1339.51 is not splayed out for you.
1341.53 For instance, it's
not told to you
1343.02 oh, this is the way
you normally hear
1344.37 and now you're hearing
things differently.
1345.99 Sometimes it's the
change in for instance
1347.7 in the way that
words are accented
1349.2 or the way the sentences
are constructed.
1351.21 This often you'll hear
in hip hop the way
1352.95 that sentences are
constructed can be divided up
1355.74 not as normal declarative
sentences the way
1357.668 that they're typically written.
1358.96 But the way that sentences
are chopped up and fractured
1361.86 reveals to us new meaning
and in fact, enhanced
1364.492 meaning about particular
words that we wouldn't
1366.45 see if it was written
out as a paragraph
1368.2 and then sung as a script that
would be the same as the one
1370.81 that we would read.
1371.61 Again, the point is that what
is exciting and novel to you is
1375.66 just the way that you hear it.
1376.95 But it's exciting
and novel to you
1378.6 because there are circuits
within the brain that when
1382.08 we hear or see or
feel or experience
1386.4 known elements in new ways
that are truly creative,
1390.78 the way that those neural
circuits function is changed.
1394.83 And when neural
circuits change the way
1397.11 that they function
simply by way of what
1399.57 comes into our eyes,
our ears, and the way
1401.55 that we experience
our feelings, there
1403.95 is the release of
chemicals, including
1405.66 the release of the
chemical dopamine
1407.19 and other
neuromodulators as well
1409.14 that make us feel both
surprised, delighted.
1412.18 And this is very key,
excited in anticipation
1415.89 that we might see it again.
1417.605 So with the
understanding in mind
1418.98 that true creativity
involves the l combination
1421.8 of some elements could be notes
of music, could be numbers,
1426.45 could be visual elements
like lines or colors,
1429.21 could be physical
movements, et cetera.
1431.52 But novel combinations
of some things
1434.58 that reveal to us something
fundamental about the way
1438.03 that our brain and/or
the world work.
1440.47 And of course, as
I mentioned before,
1442.65 that fundamental
thing may or may not
1444.78 be consciously accessible to us.
1447.06 We may not know what exactly
it is that's novel to us.
1450.9 But it feels novel
and it feels true.
1454.62 Well, with that
understanding in mind,
1456.36 we therefore can ask,
what are the underlying
1459.33 principles and
neural circuits that
1461.4 underlie the creative process.
1463.41 And the word process here
is especially important.
1466.45 In fact, if there's
one thing I'd really
1468.3 like to impress on
everybody is that when
1470.91 thinking about biology,
it's almost always better
1474.09 to think about verbs
as opposed to nouns.
1476.49 So rather than
think of creativity
1478.32 as a noun or somebody being
creative as an adjective,
1481.83 think about the verb creativity.
1483.57 That is what are
the steps required
1485.82 and therefore what are the
cells and circuits and thoughts,
1488.29 et cetera required in
order to be creative.
1492.15 This element of
thinking about verbs
1494.91 then allows us to say, OK, what
are the various steps in coming
1498.51 up with a creative idea,
in testing a creative idea,
1501.93 and then implementing
that creative idea.
1504.18 And in doing so, we find based
on the scientific literature
1507.66 that there are basically
three major networks
1509.97 within the brain, each of
which is responsible for each
1512.94 of the three steps to arrive
at something truly creative.
1516.33 The first neural circuit
involved in creativity
1518.37 is the so-called
executive network.
1520.77 This is a goofy name because
the neural circuits that I'm
1523.71 about to describe do a bunch
of other things as well,
1526.11 but they certainly control what
are called executive functions.
1529.62 Executive functions
are functions
1531.9 that you and I both have,
which is our ability
1535.35 to govern our thinking
and our behavior
1537.48 in very deliberate ways.
1538.95 And that is largely
accomplished through the use
1542.01 of the neural circuitry
that sits right
1544.29 behind the forebrain, the
so-called prefrontal cortex.
1546.85 Now, the prefrontal
cortex involves
1549.18 many different subregions.
1550.565 It has a bunch of
different parts
1551.94 just like any country has
different states, et cetera
1554.148 and provinces.
1555.72 Executive function involves
the prefrontal cortex
1558.0 and some other
neural structures.
1560.14 But for the sake
of this discussion,
1562.65 executive function and
the prefrontal cortex
1565.59 are mainly responsible
for suppressing action.
1568.71 That is, for eliminating choices
among the infinite number
1573.3 of choices that exist.
1574.96 For instance, of what colors
to combine on a painting
1577.26 or what lines to draw
or what notes to play
1579.66 or what movements
to make in a sports
1581.34 endeavor, what numbers to
include in a mathematics
1583.68 endeavor, or what words
and letters and syllables
1587.04 and sentences to include in
writing a creative passage.
1591.95 The second network is the
so-called default mode network.
1595.162 There's a lot of discussion
nowadays about the default mode
1597.62 network as it relates to
consciousness and meditation,
1600.38 et cetera.
1600.92 The default mode network
does many different things.
1603.54 But in the context of our
discussion about creativity,
1605.93 the default mode
network is really
1608.3 the network that
starts being engaged
1610.16 when you close your eyes
and start paying attention
1613.1 to what's going on in terms
of your thinking as opposed
1616.13 to the sensory outside world.
1618.38 And the default mode network is
especially important for what's
1622.1 called spontaneous imagination.
1624.03 Now, spontaneous
imagination is something
1625.94 that you can try at any moment
if you were to close your eyes
1628.55 and to try and not pay attention
to the sounds around you.
1631.58 But even if you do, to just
pay attention to whatever
1636.16 thoughts or feelings emerge
when your eyes are closed.
1639.72 By closing your eyes
and shutting yourself
1641.47 off to the outside
sensory world,
1644.18 you start to engage much
more of your brain machinery
1647.29 dedicated towards
what's going on
1649.12 inside you, so-called
interoception but also
1651.46 what you're thinking
about your thinking
1653.38 whether or not your thoughts
are complete or incomplete,
1656.0 whether or not they are
fragmentary in a way that goes
1658.69 from one thought to another
distantly in the past
1661.27 or present to future, et cetera.
1662.89 Depending on time of
day, how well-rested
1664.885 you are, how stressed you
are, how happy you are,
1667.57 the default mode
network will take you
1669.368 through a journey of
different types of thoughts,
1671.41 different types of
feelings, et cetera.
1673.035 The specific types of
thoughts and feelings
1675.07 are not as interesting
as the fact
1676.54 that when you close your
eyes you're essentially
1678.4 engaging this default mode
network, which is essentially
1680.8 the network associated with
imagination and imagination
1684.04 based on elements that exist
only within your head, that
1687.88 is within your brain and
therefore must rely on memory
1693.01 of previous experiences.
1694.685 As soon as you close your
eyes, you are shutting yourself
1697.06 off from the sensory world.
1698.54 So by definition
you can no longer
1700.39 be bringing in novel
experiences in that moment.
1703.12 You're relying on your library
of existing experiences
1706.3 and your memory of those in
order to imagine new things.
1709.45 And you're doing this in a
very free associative way.
1711.963 You're not trying to
imagine new things.
1713.63 It's just whatever
geysers to the surface.
1715.7 So we've got the
executive network,
1717.16 which is involved in suppressing
particular thoughts or actions.
1721.12 We have the default
mode network, which
1723.37 is involved in imagination.
1724.78 And the default mode network
I should mention also
1727.06 involves a subregion of
the prefrontal cortex.
1728.99 It's called the medial
prefrontal cortex
1730.657 but other brain regions as well.
1732.71 And then the final
element within
1734.35 the circuits
underlying creativity
1735.963 is the so-called
salience network.
1737.38 The salience network is a
network of brain regions
1741.19 that involves areas such as
the Insula, which actually
1743.98 has a complete map
of your body surface
1745.75 as well as some
information mapped there
1747.96 about what's going on
in the outside world
1749.71 and how those
combined with what's
1750.94 going on in your
internal landscape, that
1752.648 is within your body.
1753.7 Also a brain region called
the ACC or intengu--
1756.49 excuse me, anterior cingulate
cortex and the amygdala.
1760.185 So a lot of
information is mapped
1761.56 within the salience
network about how we feel
1764.207 and how we feel in relation
to things that are happening
1766.54 around us and within us.
1768.11 And the salience network
has one main job,
1770.752 which is to pay
attention to what's
1772.21 most interesting either
in the world or inside us
1777.07 in terms of feelings
or experiences.
1779.75 So we've got three networks--
executive network, which
1782.53 is there to suppress
choices in terms of actions
1786.13 we could take but
decide not to, or things
1788.44 we could think about but
choose not to or try not to,
1791.32 the default mode network,
which is basically the catalog
1794.83 or library of
previous experiences
1797.59 that we have available to us
that would act as the paints
1801.76 on a palette or the
possible ingredients
1805.24 that could go into a recipe.
1806.59 All of that has to, again,
arise from previous experience.
1809.47 We can't close our
eyes and suddenly
1811.51 be able to access all the
melodies that we've never
1814.51 heard before or all our ideas
and concepts and knowledge
1818.41 about music if we don't
have musical understanding
1820.72 or visual understanding.
1821.92 So we're really
drawing up the library.
1824.23 And that library tends to
be rather disorganized.
1826.66 It swirls around.
1827.95 It's not very structured
unless we're actively trying
1830.86 to think about something.
1832.15 And then we have the
salience network,
1834.31 which is the networks within
the brain that decide or make
1837.4 choices about what's most
interesting to pay attention to
1839.95 in a given moment.
1841.52 So those three networks work
together to create things.
1845.29 And when I say create
things, we again
1847.48 have to really
definition of creativity.
1850.78 Creativity is a rearrangement
of existing elements into novel
1855.46 combinations that reveal
something fundamental about how
1858.37 we or the world works.
1860.29 And, this is very important.
1862.73 It tends to be things
that are useful.
1865.99 Now, they can merely be
useful because they're
1867.91 entertaining or
thrilling, they can also
1870.04 have a particular utility
or use in the world
1872.11 like a piece of technology
that is actually
1874.39 useful like an app
or a smartphone
1877.03 or a computer actually
has utility or a vehicle.
1880.06 There are creative acts that
led to the formation of vehicles
1883.84 and computers, et cetera.
1885.28 But the point is that
just merely coming up
1888.46 with novel combinations of
things like wings on a fish
1890.95 tank, that's not
creative or it's not
1893.17 creative in any meaningful way
because it's simply not useful.
1897.71 It doesn't reveal anything
fundamental new or purposeful.
1901.39 It doesn't allow
us to think about
1903.19 or interact with the world
or ourselves in novel ways.
1905.77 Whereas things, people,
actions, and ideas
1910.69 that are truly creative
really change the way
1913.408 that we are able to
access the world.
1914.95 They act as portals to the
world and to ourselves.
1918.58 I'd like to take a quick
break and acknowledge
1920.83 one of our sponsors
Athletic Greens.
1922.99 Athletic Greenes now called AG1
is a vitamin mineral probiotic
1927.31 drink that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.
1930.64 I've been taking Athletic
Greene since 2012.
1933.192 So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
1935.7 The reason I started taking
Athletic Greens and the reason
1938.117 I still take Athletic Greens,
once or usually twice a day
1941.19 is that it gets to me
the probiotics that I
1943.53 need for gut health, our
gut is very important.
1946.08 It's populated by
gut microbiota that
1948.56 communicate with the brain, the
immune system, and basically
1951.06 all the biological
systems of our body
1952.8 to strongly impact our
immediate and long-term health.
1956.34 And those probiotics
and Athletic Greens
1958.26 are optimal and vital
for microbiome health.
1962.043 In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number
1963.96 of adaptogens,
vitamins, and minerals
1965.58 that make sure that all of my
foundational nutritional needs
1968.22 are met.
1968.85 And it tastes great.
1970.818 If you'd like to
try Athletic Greens,
1972.36 you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
1975.57 and they'll give you five
free travel packs that make it
1978.12 really easy to mix up
Athletic Greens while
1980.107 you're on the road, in the
car, on the plane, et cetera.
1982.44 And they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D-3 K-2.
1986.04 Again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman
1988.65 to get the five free travel
packs and the year supply
1991.23 of vitamin D-3 K-2.
1992.91 So now you have some idea about
the brain areas and networks
1995.61 involved in creativity.
1997.44 But I want to be very
clear that any time we
1999.69 talk about mechanisms
and brain areas, what's
2001.88 far more important than the
names of those brain areas
2004.43 is an understanding
of what they do.
2005.947 So if you couldn't remember
the anterior cingulate
2008.03 cortex or the fact that
the prefrontal cortex is
2010.16 involved in executive function,
et cetera, that's fine.
2013.58 It's less important that
you know the names of things
2015.8 than you understand the action
steps that those things take.
2018.86 That is the verb actions
that those particular brain
2021.77 areas engage in order to arrive
at a particular endpoint.
2024.41 And the endpoint we're talking
about today is creativity.
2028.47 I want to discuss creativity
in terms of what actually
2031.67 goes into being creative.
2033.11 And it turns out there
are just two elements.
2035.012 And those two
elements are now well
2036.47 understood from the
perspective of psychology
2038.54 and fortunately, the
neuroscience well
2041.39 supports what the psychology
says and vise versa.
2044.51 And those two elements
that go into coming up
2047.48 with a creative idea and then
implementing or developing
2050.929 that creative idea
into something real
2052.98 that you and the rest of
the world can experience
2055.55 or divergent thinking
and convergent thinking.
2059.03 And divergent thinking
and convergent thinking
2061.909 are very straightforward
to understand.
2064.61 Divergent thinking is taking
some known object or event
2071.15 in the world or
sport or concept.
2074.449 It could be running.
2075.409 It could be a musical note.
2076.94 It could be jumping.
2078.17 It could be a particular
color on a piece of paper.
2082.46 And asking yourself how
many different things
2087.32 could that thing actually be.
2089.297 And you might say, well,
running is running.
2091.13 But let's use divergent
thinking as a way
2093.65 to illustrate what
divergent thinking is.
2095.659 If I show you a picture
of somebody running,
2097.508 I say, what do you.
2098.3 See and you say I
see somebody running.
2100.19 And then I might give you
a divergent thinking task
2103.16 and these tasks
are the same ones
2104.84 used in various experiments.
2106.103 And I'd say, how many
different things can you
2108.02 think about based on
this picture that you
2111.53 see of somebody running.
2112.91 Now, if you are able to
engage divergent thinking,
2115.86 you could say
running to the store.
2118.73 Running away from a lion.
2120.65 Running towards somebody I love.
2122.69 Or maybe you have a more
elaborate imagination
2125.81 and you could say,
running in front of a bus
2129.41 to grab a kid so the kid
doesn't get hit by the bus.
2132.08 Or running toward a
concert because I'm
2134.18 so excited about the
particular concert
2136.07 and then it starts to
spool into a story.
2137.85 In other words,
divergent thinking
2139.88 involves taking one simple what
we would call a neuroscience
2143.6 or psychology stimulus, one
image, or sound, et cetera
2147.2 and trying to
radiate out from that
2149.24 as many different divergent
situations, properties,
2156.2 characteristics, events, things
from that one specific element.
2161.09 So any divergent thinking task
would involve exactly that.
2163.82 I'd show you pictures or play
you sounds or words or notes
2168.02 or describe to you
events in history
2171.26 and try and see how many
things can radiate out
2174.17 from that in to diverse,
diverse, even distant types
2178.67 of concepts and pictures.
2180.16 OK.
2180.66 So that's divergent thinking.
2182.1 Divergent thinking
is really the process
2183.95 that underlies idea generation.
2186.17 And the basis of
divergent thinking
2189.38 is that more than
one idea is correct.
2192.17 In fact, the more ideas that
you have about one thing,
2195.56 the better your
divergent thinking.
2197.57 So if I were to give you
three minutes to list off
2200.69 all the things you can think
about related to this pen
2203.787 that I'm holding up.
2204.62 For those of you listening
I'm just holding up
2205.76 a pen in front of me.
2207.23 You just write them
out or say them out.
2208.97 Over the next 3 minutes
that would be an example
2211.623 of divergent thinking.
2212.54 However, if you just said
black pen, red pen, white pen,
2215.595 green pen, et cetera, that's
not very divergent thinking.
2217.97 It's only divergent in the
context of color space.
2221.01 And when I say space
that's just a nerd
2223.13 speak for one particular
domain of thinking.
2225.68 Whereas if you said
red pen, white pen,
2230.0 essay pen in a door
to hold the door
2233.54 open so that someone can
return to a building.
2235.94 And you started spooling
off a story related to that
2238.25 and why that was important,
well, there you go.
2240.32 Divergent thinking is
essentially taking one element
2243.17 and coming up with
many, many answers.
2244.942 And in the context of
divergent thinking,
2246.65 any answer goes, but
as we'll soon learn,
2249.32 not every answer is
interesting and relevant
2252.14 that is not every answer help
solve something or reveal
2255.53 something fundamental
and therefore,
2257.03 not every divergent
answer is truly creative.
2260.697 The other aspect of
divergent thinking
2262.28 that's really
important to understand
2263.96 is that the selection criteria
are extremely vague and vast.
2269.12 That is, there
are no constraints
2270.56 on what you come up with.
2271.86 So if I hold up this
pen and you say,
2273.77 orangutan, that's a perfectly
valid divergent idea
2278.63 from this pen because
you thought of it
2280.58 and it's distantly related.
2281.75 However, we have to
remember our earlier rule.
2285.47 If black pen and orangutan are
not linked up in our brain,
2291.23 in the observer's brain
in any meaningful way,
2293.66 it's only interesting
to you because you
2296.185 are the only one
that understands
2297.56 the rule that underlies the link
between this pen and orangutan.
2302.33 Whereas if you come up with
something different that
2305.48 somehow tells me and
everybody else something
2307.76 interesting about
pens or orangutans,
2309.5 now that's a truly
creative idea.
2311.63 I don't have such
an example in mind
2313.418 but later I'll give
you some examples
2314.96 of how you can actually
March down the path
2316.752 of divergent thinking and
use that executive network
2319.73 to suppress certain
options to cross off
2321.62 certain answers because, again,
an answer is valid but not all
2325.97 valid answers are
interesting or useful.
2328.67 And you can cross
those off and arrive
2330.53 at the most interesting
and truly creative answer.
2334.16 A couple of more things
about divergent thinking.
2336.45 Divergent thinking largely
taps into the networks
2338.9 of the brain that are involved
in mental flexibility.
2342.51 So this is a different aspect
of our prefrontal cortex, which
2345.95 is not based on executive
function and our ability
2348.83 to reduce options but rather
areas of the prefrontal cortex
2354.33 that are available to
generate multiple options
2357.3 and actually suppress context
to forget that pens are just
2360.973 for writing, for
instance, and that pens
2362.64 can do other things
like hold a door open.
2364.5 It's really an
unusual use of a pen.
2367.005 Again, none of these
examples that I'm giving
2368.88 are particularly interesting.
2370.118 They're just designed to get
you to understand the underlying
2372.66 concept of divergent thinking.
2374.55 And then the last
thing I'd like you
2376.05 to know about divergent thinking
is that divergent thinking
2379.35 involves a exploration.
2381.66 It's a wandering through
of ideas that you already
2385.14 had in your library, in
your memory banks about pens
2389.58 and what pens
could be related to
2392.13 and what pens ought
not to be related to.
2394.95 So, again, what's really
important about creativity
2397.68 is that there has to be the
basic building blocks already
2401.13 existing within us.
2402.31 This is why it's so
important to understand
2404.55 that if you are somebody who
really seeks to be creative,
2407.67 you really do need to
be somebody who forages
2410.28 for information and structured
information in particular
2414.09 if you are to be creative.
2415.74 The architect
simply can't come up
2417.69 with incredible drawings
or plans for buildings
2421.26 without understanding how
buildings are put together
2423.48 in the various rules
that govern buildings.
2425.808 In other words, you
can't break rules
2427.35 that you don't understand.
2428.64 I think in movies,
especially, we
2431.82 have this idea in mind
of this limitless concept
2435.42 or that we have these hidden
geniuses that somehow have
2439.32 access to all the math
knowledge without ever having
2442.38 done any formal math.
2443.28 Actually I was flying
back from Texas recently
2445.792 and Good Will Hunting
was on somebody's screen.
2447.75 I don't tend to watch
movies on the plane
2449.458 very often, sometimes
but not often.
2451.27 And I was remembering
in that movie,
2452.85 you've got this math genius who
is a janitor at MIT, et cetera
2458.13 and apparently just has
access to all this knowledge.
2460.86 It's a wonderful concept.
2462.93 A very, very I would say
even exceedingly rare thing
2466.83 to occur in the world.
2467.797 Sure there are people
who seem to have
2469.38 a natural talent for mathematics
or for something else.
2472.24 But this idea that
there are incredible
2475.59 geniuses among us that
just spontaneously
2478.2 have so much knowledge, that's
by far the exception rather
2482.4 than the rule, of course, and
may not even actually exist.
2484.902 I'm sure someone will put
it in the comments examples
2487.11 where this actually exists.
2488.04 More often than
not, what you find
2489.48 is that people who have extreme
virtuosity in a given area
2493.26 put many, many years
into developing
2496.32 the basic substrates,
the basic building blocks
2498.93 of whatever it is
their craft happens
2500.49 to be where they
demonstrate virtuosity.
2502.26 So this is very
important to understand.
2503.927 Nonetheless, divergent thinking
is the critical element
2508.86 for initiating the
creative process.
2511.5 Again, thinking about
creativity as a verb.
2513.54 And divergent thinking involves
taking some starting point,
2517.86 in this case a pen,
and then radiating out
2520.2 from that in a fairly
unconstrained what biologists
2523.08 call a random walk just
wandering through your thought
2526.44 space and memory
space about what
2528.12 could be related to this pen.
2529.44 Now, on the flip
side of creativity
2531.0 is the implementation of
specific combinations of things
2535.38 and testing those to see whether
or not they are interesting,
2538.5 relevant, or delight
to us or other people
2541.38 or scare us or other people
or thrill us or other people.
2544.59 In other words, a testing
of whether or not there's
2547.77 some fundamental rule to emerge.
2550.59 Again, I'm going to repeat
this many, many times
2552.87 throughout this
episode and I'm not
2554.01 going to apologize for
that because I think
2555.54 it's so important to understand
that creativity is not just
2558.0 novel combinations.
2558.93 They are novel
combinations of things that
2561.03 reveal something fundamental.
2562.65 And that often pop out
to us if not every time
2566.43 certainly most of the time
that we see that thing.
2568.8 It almost never
seems to be the case
2570.87 that something truly creative
dulls in its expression.
2574.14 And that's because what
it's repeating to us
2576.45 over and over again is this
fundamental rule that normally
2579.06 we can't see or
hear or experience
2581.04 in the absence of
this creative act.
2583.68 So the second part of creativity
where things are tested
2587.73 and where truly creative
elements are discovered
2590.85 is in convergent thinking.
2592.53 And convergent thinking
is, as the name
2594.21 suggests, just the opposite
of divergent thinking.
2596.37 Convergent thinking
would be, for example,
2599.323 if I give you an image or I
tell you the following things,
2601.74 I say wing, water, an engine.
2607.69 The concept that I
happen to have in mind
2609.61 is that of a plane
that can land on water.
2613.66 Most planes don't
land on water or not
2616.12 intended to land on water.
2617.83 One would hope that
their plane doesn't
2619.48 land on water unless
it's a plane designed
2621.23 to land on water.
2622.18 But in this case, a plane
that can land on water
2625.69 is one of the very few answers
that can combine wing, water,
2632.11 and engine.
2633.73 I'm sure there
are other answers,
2635.14 there are other
convergent thinking modes
2637.39 that can take you to an
answer that would be valid.
2639.86 But there are not many.
2641.08 And here what's
really most important
2642.67 is that I'm not asking
you to spool out
2644.8 or to radiate out from
these three things.
2647.68 Rather, I'm asking you to
combine them in some way that
2650.14 makes sense in the real world.
2652.33 And indeed there are planes
that can land on water.
2655.0 And wing water and
engine combined
2658.493 within those things
they are fundamental
2660.16 features, they are in
fact, necessary but not
2663.13 sufficient for having a
plane that can land on water.
2666.05 OK.
2666.55 So that's just one example
of convergent thinking.
2668.633 And a convergent
thinking task would
2670.36 involve you being given
a list of two or three
2673.19 or maybe even five
different things.
2674.69 And then for each of
those two or three or five
2676.09 different things,
as quickly as you
2677.62 can to come up with
a single answer
2679.51 that binds all of those
in a real world concept
2682.36 that obey the laws of nature
or physics in some way.
2685.84 For instance, you can just come
up with some answer that said,
2690.28 a bird that swallowed
an engine and that
2693.79 happens to be a sea bird.
2694.96 You could come up with that,
but that actually is not
2697.24 something that happens or
is that very typical at all.
2700.58 And so it seems like a mishmash
of things that are really
2703.75 just designed for you
to try and accomplish
2705.61 an answer rather
than something real,
2707.36 such as a plane
that lands on water.
2709.07 OK.
2709.75 The point here is that
divergent thinking
2712.69 is one aspect of our
cognition, of our thinking.
2716.14 And convergent thinking
is a very distinct aspect
2719.68 of our cognition.
2720.91 In fact, one of the
critical requirements
2723.61 for convergent thinking is
also to access our memory banks
2726.805 and our understanding
about the outside world
2728.68 just as it were with
divergent thinking,
2730.99 but it requires more focus
and more persistence.
2735.16 In fact, if we were to
come up with a key rule
2737.56 for divergent
thinking, it would be
2739.15 you almost want to have just
enough focus to remember what
2742.12 the initial object or
thing that was mentioned
2745.27 was to keep that in mind
so that your answers don't
2748.24 become completely random.
2749.62 But the more distant and
everywhere in between that
2753.31 you can generate
answers that is,
2755.35 the things that are
very close to pens,
2757.69 black pen, red pen
versus pen and doorstop,
2761.47 pen acting as a doorstop.
2763.06 Those are-- one is
very close, red pen is
2766.81 very close to black pen,
doorstop is pretty far
2769.75 from black pen.
2771.19 So that's the idea.
2772.51 Is that you want to explore and
undergo a range of exploration
2775.773 of different ideas whereas
with convergent thinking,
2777.94 you're really trying to
bind these things together.
2780.26 And so the key element
for convergent thinking
2783.64 is the aspect of
persistence and focus.
2787.06 And that's why convergent
thinking in many ways
2790.27 feels harder than
divergent thinking.
2792.55 It feels like there's an answer.
2793.99 And I want to get the answer
right and I can't solve it.
2796.323 It's a puzzle and
it's a puzzle that
2797.89 relies on very
distinct brain circuits
2799.99 from divergent thinking.
2801.16 Which brain circuits?
2802.39 Well, that's what we're
going to describe next.
2804.43 And again, this
is not just going
2805.805 to be a list of different brain
circuits with different names
2808.382 doing different things,
that wouldn't be useful
2810.34 to you or to me.
2811.57 Rather, what you're about to
learn is truly incredible.
2815.92 What it is we're going to talk
about one single molecule--
2819.46 dopamine, which is a
molecule most typically
2822.43 associated with motivation
and desire and drive
2825.1 and feelings of
pleasure in some cases.
2826.96 But that actually resides
within four different networks
2830.828 in the brain.
2831.37 Today we're going to talk
about two of those networks.
2833.92 And dopamine acting
in one network
2837.8 directly underlies
divergent thinking.
2840.89 Whereas dopamine in
another brain network
2843.38 underlies convergent thinking.
2845.42 And if at this point
in this episode
2847.225 you're saying OK,
when am I going
2848.6 to get the tools to
understand creativity
2850.4 and how to be creative,
what I can assure
2852.26 you is that if you understand
divergent thinking which
2854.63 hopefully now you do, and you
can understand what convergent
2857.63 thinking is, and
you can understand
2860.39 that dopamine is responsible
for both divergent thinking
2864.17 and convergent thinking but
through separate pathways.
2867.29 Well, then if you can understand
how those two separate pathways
2870.17 work and how to engage
them differentially,
2873.14 therein lie the tools that you
can use both to explore ideas.
2878.07 In other words, find what it
is that could be creative.
2881.6 And then systematically
test each of those ideas
2884.81 for what is truly creative.
2886.4 That is what meets the
criteria for something
2888.59 that is novel and truly
useful and informs us
2891.62 about something that we've never
seen, heard, or felt before.
2895.17 Let's just take a moment to talk
about the incredible molecule
2897.77 that is dopamine.
2899.51 Many people are familiar with
dopamine from the concept
2902.0 of quote unquote
"dopamine hits," which
2904.88 is popular language describing
the feeling of pleasure
2908.75 that we get from pretty
much anything that we like
2912.32 or that we continue to
engage in repeatedly.
2914.45 So some people will talk
about the dopamine hit
2916.408 that they get from
somebody attractive
2918.5 that they like texting them back
or the dopamine hit that they
2921.565 get from social media or
the dopamine hit that they
2923.69 get from sugar or the dopamine
that they get from this
2926.0 or from that.
2927.08 To be honest, the
concept of dopamine hits
2929.66 is not one that I favor because
in general, whenever people
2933.032 talk about dopamine
hits, typically
2934.49 they are talking
about activities
2935.865 such as social media
for which dopamine
2938.75 may be involved at some level.
2940.82 But often it's the case
that the behavior associated
2944.45 with that thing in
this case, social media
2946.22 is more of the compulsive
nature rather than
2949.04 an active seeking of something
with positive anticipation.
2952.49 And that's really what
dopamine is about at least
2954.83 in the context of one of its
major functions in the brain.
2957.38 Dopamine is really about
motivation and desire
2960.53 and movement.
2962.3 And it makes sense why
motivation, desire,
2964.16 and movement would be
linked up through a common,
2967.19 in this case neuromodulator
or chemical like dopamine.
2970.34 Because throughout
evolution if we
2972.98 were excited for or motivated
to pursue something,
2976.82 we had to move in order
to get it, to obtain it.
2979.97 And in general, we
can frame dopamine
2981.77 under the umbrella
of dopamine tends
2983.425 to be involved in
neural circuits
2984.8 in the brain that are involved
in processes that are taking us
2989.0 beyond the confines of our skin.
2990.92 That is, they motivate us
to go do something in terms
2993.62 of action in the world.
2995.03 Now, that statement might
seem distantly placed
2998.57 from a discussion
about creativity,
3000.377 but as we'll learn
a little bit later,
3001.96 one of the most useful tools
for engaging creativity
3006.07 and becoming more creative is
to think about action elements
3010.39 within a narrative.
3011.44 That is, things that we
and others can do in order
3014.26 to discover new rules
through actual movement.
3017.74 That's a little bit cryptic.
3019.48 Forgive me.
3020.11 But I promise I'll
return to it later
3021.652 and I will make
it crystal clear.
3024.46 There are four major circuits
in the brain that use dopamine.
3027.88 Although I should mention,
there are additional circuits
3030.45 as well.
3030.95 In fact, your eye
even contains neurons
3032.883 that release
dopamine that control
3034.3 the sensitivity of your eye
at different times of day
3036.73 to light, et cetera.
3038.23 The four major
circuits in the brain
3039.73 that utilize
dopamine however, are
3041.29 used for four major purposes.
3043.395 And I'll describe
what those are.
3044.77 First of all is a
neural circuit that
3047.17 uses dopamine among other
things but certainly relies
3050.14 on dopamine in a critical way
to engage movement, including
3054.19 eye movements.
3054.903 And we will return
to eye movement
3056.32 to why they're so important
for understanding creativity
3059.14 and maybe even for generating
creativity a little bit later.
3062.39 The name of the
circuit, again, is less
3064.24 important than what it does.
3065.81 But the name of this circuit
for those that want to know
3068.56 is the so-called
nigrostriatal pathway.
3071.53 The substantia nigra
is a brain area
3073.6 that is very dark that
projects to an area
3076.42 called the dorsal striatum.
3077.853 It contains a bunch
of subregions.
3079.27 So, again, for those of you that
really geek out on this stuff
3081.853 great, you can learn these names
and retain them in your memory.
3084.633 If you don't care about
names, don't worry about it,
3086.8 just discard the names.
3087.91 But areas of the brain like
the caudate and putamen
3090.22 and the dorsal
striatum receive input
3091.99 from the substantia nigra.
3093.76 In neuroanatomy, when
we name something,
3096.52 we say the origin of that thing
and where it connects through.
3100.6 So nigrostriatal
tells you that there
3103.147 is a connection between
the substantia nigra
3104.98 because it came
first, nigrostriatal,
3106.63 and then striatal
is where it ends up.
3108.43 So nigrostriatal pathway is
involved in generating bodily
3111.4 movements.
3112.24 It's involved in eye movements.
3114.58 And it is actually
a brain area that's
3116.95 engaged when you
think about movement.
3119.943 You can just have a story
in your mind about walking
3122.11 or a story in your mind
about running or story
3124.225 in your mind about driving.
3125.44 This area is engaged.
3126.79 Very interesting brain area.
3128.89 So that's the first circuit.
3130.172 Very important to understand.
3131.38 And I'll tell you
right now, that
3133.09 is the brain circuit
that is engaged when
3136.0 you undergo divergent thinking.
3139.39 Now, that itself
should be interesting.
3141.37 Even if you don't remember
any of the names of the things
3143.29 I just told you, that
you have a brain circuit
3145.24 that even if you just
think about walking it
3148.0 becomes more active.
3148.93 And the dopamine is involved
in that brain activity.
3151.88 And if you recall,
divergent thinking
3153.82 involves taking a concept
as boring as a pen
3158.62 and thinking about
other concepts that
3161.71 could link up with that pen in
some way, logical or illogical.
3165.67 The bridge could be completely
abstract and really fantastical
3169.99 with a bunch of different
ideas in between.
3172.09 A pen acting as a doorstop
because of some situation
3174.498 where you need to run
down stairs in a fire
3176.29 and get back upstairs
quickly to rescue
3177.915 somebody, very divergent.
3179.35 Or as divergent as
black pen to red pen.
3183.15 But what's amazing is
that that same circuit
3185.7 is the one that's involved
in generating and thinking
3189.69 about physical movement.
3190.8 That turns out to be vitally
important for tapping
3193.83 into the creativity process.
3195.1 So really frame that up in your
mind or commit it to memory.
3197.74 Now, the second dopamine circuit
associated with creativity
3200.46 is the one associated with
convergent thinking, which,
3203.19 again, is the
thinking where there's
3204.69 a specific correct answer.
3206.81 It requires focus and
it requires persistence.
3209.46 And the name of that
circuit, again, the name
3211.47 isn't as important
as what it does.
3212.95 But the name of that circuit
is the mesocortical pathway.
3217.59 The mesocortical pathway
is involved in motivation
3221.07 and it has an emotional
component too.
3224.09 Now, it will become
clear in a few minutes
3225.84 why that emotional
component is vital.
3227.97 But this is a circuit
that originates
3229.53 in a brain structure called the
lateral ventral tegmental area.
3233.16 Again, a bunch of words you
can remember it if you want,
3235.53 lateral ventral
tegmental area or you
3238.14 can not worry about the name.
3239.52 And it connects to
the prefrontal cortex,
3241.38 that area just
behind the forehead.
3243.31 And this mesocortical
area is involved
3245.31 in motivation and emotion
and is critical for focus
3248.19 and persistence.
3249.39 It is distinct from
a very nearby area,
3251.91 just sitting right next door
the so-called mesolimbic area,
3256.08 which is involved in desire
and feelings of reward.
3260.08 And this is the area that
is associated more typically
3262.44 with addictive behaviors
or compulsive behaviors.
3266.305 We're going to leave
out the discussion
3267.93 about the mesolimbic
pathway for now
3269.97 because it's not critical
to divergent or convergent
3273.27 thinking and it's not critical
to the process of creativity
3277.02 at least as far as we know.
3278.682 But I mention it because it
is the third and the four
3280.89 dopaminergic circuits.
3281.82 And then the fourth
circuit certainly
3283.89 one I've never talked about
before on this podcast, which
3287.31 doesn't mean anything
except that we
3288.81 haven't gotten to it yet,
is that tuberoinfundibular
3292.77 pathway.
3293.43 And that is the
pathway associated
3294.99 with dopamine and
your pituitary gland
3296.91 and the release of
hormones, in particular
3299.76 that travel to the ovary.
3301.068 If you have ovaries
or to your testes
3302.61 if you have testes and
trigger the release of things
3304.777 like estrogen and
testosterone, et cetera.
3307.29 Dopamine is intimately
involved in that circuitry.
3311.04 Again, not the topic
of today's discussion.
3313.5 For today's discussion,
we want to remember
3315.42 that there's a
dopamine circuit called
3317.01 the nigrostriatal circuit,
which is involved in movement
3319.74 and divergent thinking.
3322.38 And that alone should set
a flag up for you like wow,
3325.68 just thinking about
new ideas has something
3327.93 to do with physical movement.
3330.24 And the dopamine circuit that is
the mesocortical pathway, which
3336.34 is the one that's associated
with motivation and emotion,
3339.49 and that's the one required
for persistence and focus
3341.95 for convergent thinking.
3343.46 Why am I telling you all
of this about dopamine?
3346.27 Well, it turns out that dopamine
creates a certain number
3350.89 of responses in the brain and
body when it is active in one
3355.778 or the other of these circuits.
3357.07 And just for sake
of simplicity, so
3358.93 I don't have to keep saying
nigrostriatal and mesocortical.
3363.55 Here going forward,
I'm going to talk
3365.74 about the dopamine
circuit that's
3367.57 associated with
divergent thinking
3369.46 or the dopamine
circuit associated
3371.11 with convergent thinking.
3372.235 And, again, divergent
thinking and convergent
3374.11 think are the two processes
that have to occur.
3377.56 Usually first divergent then
convergent thinking then
3380.175 back and forth
and back and forth
3381.55 in order to arrive at
something creative.
3383.74 Divergent thinking
is about exploration.
3385.475 Convergent thinking is about
testing things and coming up
3387.85 with things that are the
right answer that feel right.
3390.58 And we will better define what
right means a little bit later.
3393.55 But you already know
right in this context
3397.57 is when you have some
combination of elements
3400.96 or some idea or
some written passage
3402.76 or some music or
some physical action
3405.19 that you just know this is
really novel and really cool.
3410.71 Or people see it or
hear it or taste it
3414.55 and say, this is really
novel and really cool
3416.83 and they don't
necessarily know why.
3418.66 It's just different in
a way that feels true.
3421.69 I'd like to take a brief
break and thank our sponsor
3424.9 InsideTracker.
3426.37 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
3429.01 that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA
3431.44 to help you better
understand your body
3433.18 and help you reach
your health goals.
3434.95 I've long been a
believer in getting
3436.45 regular blood work done.
3437.56 For the simple reason
that many of the factors
3440.042 that impact your immediate
and long term health
3442.0 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
3444.535 The problem with a lot
of blood and DNA tests
3446.41 out there however,
is that you get data
3448.36 back about metabolic factors,
lipids, and hormones,
3451.33 and so forth.
3451.88 But you don't know what
to do with those data.
3453.797 InsideTracker
solves that problem.
3455.38 And makes it very easy for you
to understand what nutritional,
3459.67 behavioral, maybe even
supplementation based
3462.52 interventions you might
want to take on in order
3465.13 to adjust the numbers of
those metabolic factors,
3467.29 hormones, lipids,
and other things that
3469.21 impact your immediate and
long-term health to bring
3471.58 those numbers into the
ranges that are appropriate
3474.04 and indeed optimal for you.

InsideTracker's plans.
3482.41 That's

3485.02 to get 20% off.
3486.167 Now, I realize that for some of
you listening to this episode,
3488.75 we are probably at the point
along the pathway of concept
3492.16 and definition
and mechanism that
3494.95 leaves you in a place
of real wanting a tool.
3498.02 And so I promise that I'm
going to get into more tools,
3500.96 but to satisfy you and to
make sure that you do indeed
3505.36 understand that
there are tools that
3506.86 can emerge from the information
that you already now
3509.23 have in mind.
3510.13 I do want to share with
you one particular tool
3512.23 from the literature that
has been demonstrated over
3515.86 and over again to support
and build and enhance
3519.85 divergent thinking.
3521.475 And I also want
to share with you
3522.85 a tool that has been shown
from the scientific literature
3525.225 to enhance convergent thinking
because both convergent and
3527.83 divergent thinking are critical
for the creative process.
3530.6 Now, I should emphasize
that some people out there
3535.63 either by training or
by genetics or by both
3538.63 will be naturally better
at divergent or convergent
3542.86 thinking.
3543.55 And in fact, we now know
in almost poetic way
3548.56 that naturally
occurring variations
3551.38 in genes which underlie
naturally occurring variations
3555.01 in the percentage of
dopamine in one set of brain
3560.23 circuits versus another do,
seem to relate to whether or not
3564.01 people are naturally good
at divergent thinking
3566.32 or convergent thinking.
3567.64 Now, that's a very
nature based explanation
3571.143 for why some people are
better at divergent thinking
3573.31 and other people are better
at convergent thinking.
3576.72 Nature and nurture is
something that can never really
3579.15 be teased apart exactly because,
of course, if someone has
3582.15 a natural proclivity for
something based on their genes,
3584.55 you can't often separate
that from their parents
3588.18 because we inherit our
genes from our parents
3591.0 although even in cases
where people are raised away
3593.37 from their parents through
adoption, et cetera.
3597.06 It's very hard to separate
nature and nurture
3599.172 because somebody with a
natural proclivity for things
3601.38 might engage in those things
more, et cetera, et cetera.
3604.11 The point is that
for those of you that
3606.12 are very, very good
at divergent thinking
3608.28 or very, very good at convergent
thinking, some of that
3611.07 might have been inherited.
3612.72 But more than likely some of
that depended on the activities
3616.05 that you engaged in
in your early years,
3619.38 in particular in the years
between age 5 and 25.
3623.31 And for those of you that
are aged between 5 and 25,
3626.85 all I can say is
please learn to engage
3629.28 both divergent and convergent
thinking as much as
3631.477 possible because you will
enhance your ability for both.
3633.81 For those of you
25 and older, you
3635.76 can still enhance
your ability to engage
3637.86 divergent and
convergent thinking.
3639.39 And the fortunate news,
the equalizer I should say
3643.35 is that regardless
of whether or not
3645.45 you're a naturally better
at divergent or convergent
3647.76 thinking or you acquired
it through activities,
3650.16 you need both in
order to be creative.
3652.33 So what we know is that in order
to engage divergent thinking,
3655.02 we need access to
our memory banks.
3656.94 We need to come up
with possibilities.
3658.668 And those possibilities
can only come
3660.21 from what's contained within
our memory systems of our brain.
3664.377 Areas like the
hippocampus, et cetera.
3665.96 But the names
again don't matter.
3667.43 We just know that
if we are going
3669.23 to come up with novel
combinations of things or novel
3671.99 uses of things or totally
new ideas about how
3674.81 objects or notes of
music or foods or tastes
3677.57 or whatever can be
combined, we have
3680.03 to do that with
pre-existing knowledge.
3681.69 And yet what we
need to do in order
3683.36 to engage divergent
thinking is suppress
3686.78 what is called
autobiographical narratives
3690.14 and in particular,
autobiographical narratives.
3692.33 We need to discard
with judgments
3695.09 about how certain
combinations of things
3698.03 impacted us in the past.
3699.95 This here I think
is what people mean
3701.9 when they encourage the
exploration of creativity
3704.84 by so-called
boundary exploration.
3706.97 You hear about this a
lot in the self-help,
3708.83 in psychology literature.
3710.03 And I'm not at all
disparaging of that literature
3712.1 although rarely does it define
exactly how and why to go
3715.7 about being more
creative or in this case
3717.8 to be more divergent
in our thinking.
3720.62 So they'll say, you
have to take risks
3722.75 or you have to
suppress judgment.
3725.09 But how do you actually do that?
3726.66 Well, there's a wonderful
paper that talks about one way
3729.8 to do it.
3730.37 One way to do it is what's
called open monitoring
3733.28 meditation or even just
open monitoring thinking.
3736.118 And just to make
what could otherwise
3737.66 be a somewhat complex
section here very simple.
3740.847 What I'll also tell
you is that if you
3742.43 want to enhance
convergent thinking,
3744.92 you can do that
a number of ways,
3747.35 but you can do that
in particular by doing
3749.57 a different type of meditation
or thought process, which
3753.23 is called focused
attention meditation.
3755.58 So let's talk about open
monitoring meditation
3757.68 and why it's so
useful for enhancing
3759.23 divergent thinking,
this critical element
3761.0 of the creative process.
3763.62 First of all, open
monitoring meditation
3765.8 and focused attention
meditation can be performed
3770.04 the exact same way physically.
3772.1 You can sit there,
eyes closed, I
3774.172 don't care if you're
in a Lotus position,
3775.88 it doesn't really matter, you're
lying down, you're standing up.
3778.547 You could in theory do open
monitoring meditation with eyes
3781.46 open and that would be an
interesting variant on it.
3783.87 But for sake of the
discussion right
3786.05 now, let's just
focus on the study
3787.52 that talks about these
specific tools and the way
3791.42 that they were
used in the study.
3793.32 The title of the paper that
I'm essentially summarizing
3796.07 is called open monitoring
meditation reduces
3798.56 the involvement of brain regions
related to memory function.
3801.66 Now, right off the
bat that will cue you
3803.36 to something interesting.
3804.51 Something about divergent
thinking and open monitoring
3807.17 is related to
suppressing memory.
3809.99 But as you recall,
just a few moments ago,
3812.39 I said that in order to
engage in divergent thinking,
3815.22 you need to kill off
the narratives of what
3819.35 has to be related to what and
come up with new narratives.
3821.81 You still need to
understand possibilities
3823.97 but you need to forget
prior understanding of what
3827.11 those possibilities have to be
and start thinking about what
3829.61 those possibilities could be.
3831.3 And so that it turns
out involves suppression
3833.3 of certain brain areas.
3835.43 Open monitoring
meditation is typically
3837.62 done for about 10 to 30 minutes
although it could be longer.
3841.46 And unlike other
forms of meditation
3843.95 where you sit and
concentrate on your breathing
3846.59 and trying to redirect your
thinking back to your breathing
3849.35 or to your posture or
to a chant or a mantra,
3854.03 open monitoring
meditation is simply
3856.79 a matter of having sit there
or lie down and close your eyes
3859.94 and to allow whatever surfaces
in your mind to surface.
3864.05 And what you practice is
the practice of nonjudgment.
3867.95 Now, nonjudgment itself is a
little bit of an abstract theme
3870.47 because, of course, the
moment you say don't judge you
3873.68 and others start to judge.
3874.82 It's just the way
that the brain works.
3876.02 You say, don't think
about an elephant
3877.49 you think about an elephant.
3878.27 That's a perfectly natural.
3879.395 You go to an edge of a bridge
or a cliff and you think about
3882.823 jumping off even
though you don't.
3884.24 Please don't jump off.
3885.343 And that's because it's
part of the circuitry that's
3887.51 keeping you from jumping off.
3888.68 Is the thought about what
would happen if you did.
3890.39 OK?
3891.02 So open monitoring
meditation involves
3893.51 dedicating a certain amount of
time where you close your eyes
3896.27 and whatever thoughts arise,
whatever emotions arise,
3899.48 whatever ideas arise
to watch those and take
3903.38 an inventory of them to just
merely watch them show up
3906.74 and pass or maybe become fixated
on them for some period of time
3910.098 or maybe even just one
for a long period of time.
3912.14 All of that is fine.
3913.32 In other words, whatever
surfaces surfaces.
3916.07 That's open
monitoring meditation.
3917.84 And that we know from
brain imaging studies
3920.3 and we know from
measurements of dopamine,
3922.28 in particular brain circuits and
we know from people who train
3926.63 with open monitoring
meditation on a regular basis
3930.41 improves divergent
thinking capability.
3933.6 So in terms of tools, practicing
open monitoring meditation
3937.64 or what I would just call
open monitoring thinking
3940.37 is going to be immensely useful.
3942.53 And this is actually
an opportunity
3944.15 to queue up something that
I mentioned in our episode
3946.358 on meditation, which goes deep
into the different meditation
3949.01 involving focus inward
and outward, et cetera.
3951.122 You're welcome to
check out that episode.
3952.83 It's at hubermanlab.com.
3954.29 But the point is that rather
than think about the word
3958.22 meditation, which carries a
bunch of ideas about what it is
3962.03 and what it isn't
and how to do it,
3964.27 meditation is really just
a perceptual exercise.
3966.815 For instance, you
could do a meditation
3968.44 where you look at a single
point on a wall for five minutes
3971.71 and redirect your focus to that
single point on a wall over
3974.332 and over again
every time your mind
3975.79 drifts as it no doubt would.
3977.38 Or to a tone in the room.
3979.06 You could attend to that
and redirect to that.
3981.1 Rather than think about
it as a meditation,
3982.892 it's really just a
perceptual exercise.
3984.74 That's all that meditation is.
3986.53 So open monitoring
meditation is really
3988.72 just a form of perception
where you're paying attention,
3991.27 you're perceiving your thoughts
without laying judgment
3994.51 to those thoughts or
trying not to lay judgment
3996.67 to those thoughts.
3997.42 And what people
find is that they
3998.795 very quickly within
a few days get better
4000.78 at doing open
monitoring meditation.
4002.31 And fortunately,
within just a few days
4005.04 and certainly within about a
week or more of practice and it
4008.4 doesn't even have to
be daily practice.
4010.31 So although, of
course, daily practice
4012.0 will accelerate the
process further,
4013.56 people become significantly
better at divergent thinking.
4016.778 And that's because of
the dopamine circuits
4018.57 and in particular, along
the nigrostriatal pathway
4021.45 becoming more active.
4022.5 And the wonderful
thing is that when
4024.12 you repeat a practice and
a particular neural circuit
4027.21 is engaged over and
over again deliberately,
4029.52 that neural circuit
becomes easier to engage.
4031.96 So-called neuroplasticity.
4033.87 So I would encourage
any of you that
4036.9 want to explore the creative
process for whatever reason
4039.96 or get better the
creative process,
4041.52 dedicate some amount of time.
4043.14 Maybe even just five
minutes every other day
4045.84 to doing this open
monitoring meditation.
4047.97 I've tried this meditation.
4049.29 It's actually quite fun to
do because at least to me
4053.47 it feels a lot easier than
the meditation associated
4057.33 with convergent thinking.
4058.71 Now, the convergent
thinking meditation
4061.05 is the so-called focus
attention meditation.
4063.55 And that's also described
in the same study.
4065.49 And other studies have
explored which particular brain
4068.43 networks it involves.
4069.75 And I can just tell
you that focused
4072.06 attention meditation,
which you can think of
4074.37 or I'd prefer that you think of
just as a perceptual exercise
4077.13 involves sitting or lying
down, closing your eyes,
4079.68 focusing either on your breath,
or some element of your body.
4083.25 Could be the tops of your knees
or the clasp of your hands.
4087.48 It could be focusing
on an auditory tone,
4090.51 you could even do it eyes open
and stare at a point on a wall
4094.23 or a flame of light.
4095.46 Whatever it happens
to be that allows
4097.26 you to redirect your focus to
a particular location or idea
4100.859 or sound.
4102.21 That is known to
improve your ability
4106.62 to engage convergent
thinking, to quickly
4110.01 parse through or analyze a
bunch of different choices,
4114.33 and to persist in
choice selection
4118.47 and therefore more rapidly
arrive at the correct answer.
4121.45 This is well-established
and, in fact, in, the episode
4123.7 I did with a wonderful
guest Dr. Wendy Suzuki
4125.832 from New York
University she talked
4127.29 about how a daily meditation
of about 10 to 13 minutes
4130.77 performed for about eight weeks.
4132.12 That's what they explore.
4133.162 And that study greatly
increases people's ability
4135.359 to focus and in
fact, their memory.
4137.981 And that's exactly
the point, which
4139.439 is that convergent thinking as
I mentioned before, it requires
4142.022 persistence, focus, and
access to specific memories.
4146.102 So if you are somebody who
wants to get better at focusing,
4148.56 that is the meditation for you.
4150.21 However, because today we're
talking about creativity,
4153.277 if you are somebody
who wants to get better
4155.069 at divergent thinking
and convergent thinking,
4157.2 the two elements of creativity.
4158.76 That is, I would encourage
you to do a dual meditation.
4163.17 That is, a meditation
that starts
4165.27 with open monitoring for
maybe 5 to 10 minutes
4169.05 and then transitions to
focused attention for maybe
4173.46 5 to 10 minutes.
4174.51 Because the positioning
of divergent thinking
4178.5 and then convergent thinking
close together, more closely
4181.68 resembles what the
creative process really is
4184.439 and what it typically involves.
4185.88 Most of us would love to
have a situation where
4188.88 we can spend a morning or a
day or a week brainstorming.
4192.66 Just brainstorming.
4193.62 Whatever we think about is fine.
4195.117 That's divergent thinking.
4196.2 Whatever elements just throw
them up on the whiteboard.
4198.66 We sometimes see
people and companies
4200.31 doing this at retreats.
4201.57 You bring people into
a novel environment.
4203.55 You say, let's just
forget all the rules
4205.217 and let's just come up with
new ideas about something.
4208.67 New uses of something,
new strategies.
4210.93 And nothing is too crazy.
4212.79 Nothing is off limits.
4213.75 And sure, that's
a useful exercise
4215.7 so-called brainstorming.
4216.99 But at some point,
there's the requirement
4219.24 to cross off things.
4220.143 And typically that's
done later in the retreat
4222.06 or later in the meeting
or later in the weekend.
4224.71 And that's a wonderful
way to approach creativity
4227.79 and to try and be creative.
4229.14 But not a lot of people train
for that on a regular basis.
4232.51 So what I just
described to you are
4234.15 research tested
tools for training
4236.002 for divergent thinking
and convergent thinking.
4237.96 And I would encourage
people who are
4239.46 interested in being more
creative to try and do these
4242.49 on a somewhat regular basis.
4243.97 If not every day then certainly
a few times a week or more.
4247.56 Certainly the more
you do it, the better
4249.492 you're going to get it.
4250.45 That's well demonstrated
in the literature.
4252.45 And if you're somebody
who's very consistent doing
4254.533 maybe five minutes of open
monitoring meditation and five
4257.44 minutes immediately
after of focus attention
4259.77 meditation daily, you
can expect that you
4261.87 will get very, very good
at these processes very,
4265.52 very quickly.
4266.45 Now, I'm not going to go
into a lengthy description
4268.75 of the different lines of
evidence that the corresponding
4272.62 areas of the brain are active
in each of these different .
4275.11 Meditation but
what I can tell you
4276.918 is that there have been
some beautiful what
4278.71 are called loss of
function studies
4280.81 where particular brain areas
are either depleted of dopamine
4284.62 or where dopamine
in some cases I
4286.298 guess what we would call
gain of function studies
4288.34 although not the gain
of function studies
4290.08 associated with virology
different gain of function
4292.205 studies where you enhance the
level of dopamine in the brain.
4294.86 What you find is that both
divergent and convergent
4298.3 thinking are enhanced
when levels of dopamine
4302.35 are elevated.
4303.46 Now, we're not necessarily
talking about pharmacology
4306.05 here.
4306.55 It turns out that
there are other ways
4308.17 to elevate dopamine
that make us better
4310.27 at divergent and convergent
thinking in particular,
4313.81 by using mood.
4315.49 And now I'd like to
talk about what mood you
4319.09 are in when you happen to
start a creative process,
4322.31 or try and do a training such
as open monitoring meditation
4326.68 or focused meditation.
4327.97 How your mood relates to your
level of dopamine at baseline.
4332.3 What we call your
tonic as it's called,
4334.61 meaning consistent or
ongoing level of dopamine,
4338.44 how that dictates whether or
not you are going to be better
4341.44 at one particular aspect of
the creative process or another
4344.71 and how you can enhance
your creativity in the very
4347.89 short term, very quickly using
tools that are known to trigger
4352.06 additional release of dopamine,
which in some cases is good
4354.94 and in some cases is
bad, I should mention.
4357.43 And in other words,
determine how
4361.18 you feel in one
moment should dictate
4363.79 what tool you should use in
order to become more creative.
4367.27 The relationship between
mood and creativity
4370.18 is a fascinating
one that is bridged
4372.85 by one main feature, which is
the amount of dopamine present
4376.84 in this nigrostriatal pathway.
4378.85 And there's a really
wonderful correlate
4380.95 or measure of the
amount of dopamine
4383.41 that's active in
that pathway that
4385.3 can be addressed noninvasively
in the laboratory.
4388.54 As I mentioned, the
nigrostriatal pathway
4390.25 is involved in movement
and in eye blinking which,
4394.338 of course, is a movement.
4395.38 It's not a movement of
the sort that we typically
4397.09 think of when we
think of movements,
4398.59 but nonetheless it
relies on dopamine levels
4400.51 in this pathway.
4401.41 And in fact, we can
state very confidently
4404.29 that when dopamine
levels are elevated,
4406.9 the blinking reflex
is more active.
4409.36 People just blink more.
4410.44 When dopamine levels are lower
or less active in this pathway,
4413.92 people tend to blink less.
4415.42 So blink frequency
is a common measure
4418.75 in studies of dopamine
within this pathway that
4422.35 relate to creativity.
4424.09 The work that I'm
about to describe
4425.65 is largely the
work of two authors
4427.51 who have done wonderful
work across several papers.
4430.54 Unfortunately,
for me their names
4431.935 are difficult to pronounce.
4433.06 So I apologize to them
and their relatives
4434.81 for what is sure to be
incorrect pronunciation.
4437.89 But the last names
of these authors
4440.23 are Chermahini and Hommel.
4442.765 They're in the Netherlands.
4443.89 So Chermahini and Hommel done
a number of different papers
4447.37 or studies rather
of the relationship
4449.35 between blinking,
mood, and creativity
4451.78 in particular,
divergent thinking.
4453.73 What they found is that
if people are blinking
4456.01 fairly often and they
measure their mood
4458.2 through subjective
tests and if they
4460.09 were to do brain imaging,
which other studies have done,
4462.64 they find is that
those people can
4464.14 engage in divergent
thinking very easily.
4467.56 In other words,
being in a good mood
4469.99 facilitates divergent thinking.
4472.66 Now, some of you might
immediately say, well, duh,
4475.15 if you're in a good
mood you can be
4476.68 more playful about the
exploration about what
4478.99 could happen with
these notes of music
4480.76 or these foods, et cetera.
4482.35 But it's not so obvious.
4483.58 Because it turns out that if
your dopamine levels are very,
4486.77 very high, and this can
be measured noninvasively
4490.828 through the frequency
of blinks or it
4492.37 can be measured more invasively
through brain imaging
4494.86 even through blood
draws or other methods
4497.14 to measure dopamine.
4498.04 If dopamine levels are very,
very high, what you observe
4501.37 is that divergent thinking
is actually very, very poor.
4504.37 Now, a naturally occurring
truly pathological example,
4508.06 this would be something
like manic bipolar disorder
4510.49 where somebody is in the
manic phase or somebody who
4513.1 has taken methamphetamine or
cocaine, what tends to happen
4516.58 is that they have lots and lots
of ideas, all of those ideas
4519.73 seem really exciting to them.
4521.182 But if you were to talk to
them for any given moment,
4523.39 they would be very fixated on
one particular tunnel of ideas.
4527.38 And by being fixated on one
particular tunnel of ideas
4530.095 like the idea that they're going
to run for president tomorrow,
4532.72 this is unfortunately
typical of people
4535.847 who have bipolar, which is
not to say that everybody who
4538.18 runs for president is bipolar
rather people who are bipolar
4541.21 often have these
delusions of grandeur
4543.158 that they're somehow going
to be president simply
4545.2 because they decided to and that
they were selected to do this,
4547.45 et cetera, et cetera.
4548.645 Ideas about themselves
and other people
4550.27 that are very constrained.
4551.95 In other words,
not very divergent.
4554.12 So divergent thinking is favored
by having elevated levels
4557.65 of dopamine but not too high.
4560.908 Well, that, of course,
creates a conundrum.
4562.7 How do you know how
much dopamine you need
4564.71 and how to achieve those
elevated levels of dopamine.
4567.08 Well, leaving aside
people who are suffering
4569.33 from a manic episode what
Chermahini and Hommel have
4573.98 discovered is that if
people are in a low mood,
4578.18 they're not feeling great,
maybe they're depressed
4580.4 but they're just not
feeling that great.
4582.067 They feel on a scale of 1 to 10,
around a 2, or a 3, maybe a 4.
4585.83 The probability
that they will be
4587.39 able to engage effectively
in divergent thinking
4590.24 is quite low.
4591.57 However, the good news
is, they are typically
4594.59 very susceptible to
elevations in mood
4598.13 through observing or
hearing positive stories,
4602.43 listening to music
that they like,
4604.31 any kind of so-called
inspirational stimuli.
4607.102 Now, this is good news.
4608.06 What this means
is that if you're
4609.435 somebody who's not feeling
very motivated to engage
4611.907 in divergent thinking, you're
not feeling very creative,
4614.24 you're feeling a little low.
4616.07 The thing to do in
that case is actually
4618.41 to take external stimuli.
4620.39 Things that you like and start
interacting with those stimuli
4623.81 to get your mood elevated
and then to engage
4625.85 in divergent thinking.
4627.26 However, what Chermahini
and Hommel have also shown
4631.55 is that if people are
already in a very good mood,
4637.58 elevating dopamine
further is not conducive.
4640.37 And in fact, is detrimental
to divergent thinking.
4643.34 And in that case, they would
be better off for example,
4647.51 not engaging in any
activities or taking anything
4652.25 in the way of pharmacology
that would further
4654.14 increase their dopamine.
4655.61 And probably limiting the
amount of external stimuli
4658.94 that are coming in through
music and visual stimuli
4661.49 and really focusing
on divergent thinking
4663.62 and the creative
process immediately.
4665.85 Now, this is important.
4667.1 In an earlier episode
both on bipolar
4669.29 and on other forms
of depression,
4670.88 I talked about how rates
of bipolar manic episodes
4676.37 and dopamine levels
and creativity
4679.31 tend to be correlated.
4680.85 Now, unfortunately, rates of
suicide are 20 to 30 times
4684.2 higher in people who have
bipolar disorder as well.
4686.7 And so there's a whole dark
side to the bipolar disorder
4689.167 that makes it a very, very
dangerous and important
4691.25 disorder to treat.
4692.99 But for sake of the
discussion of creativity,
4696.44 what this means is
that we all need
4698.51 to develop some
intuitive sense as to
4700.31 whether or not our mood is--
4703.04 suppose we could spin this into
three categories is kind of--
4706.46 yes, happy, excited, positive
mood, and, of course,
4710.16 there are going to
be levels to that.
4712.01 Low like, mmmh, or
meh in the middle.
4716.1 So if you're in a
low mood or meh mood,
4718.82 by all means engage
in something probably
4721.49 for about 5 to 30
minutes that elevates
4723.83 your mood before trying to
engage in divergent thinking.
4726.41 However, if you happen to be
in a pretty positive mood,
4728.84 even if you're not 10
out of 10 on mood, then
4731.66 bringing in additional
stimuli to increase
4735.08 your levels of dopamine
will not help you
4737.24 and in fact can hurt the
divergent thinking process.
4740.22 So in that case, I
would also encourage
4742.43 you to think about
something that
4743.93 was discussed on a
previous episode, which
4745.73 is the particular
effects of caffeine.
4747.86 I'll get into caffeine
a little bit later.
4749.7 But just very briefly,
caffeine increases
4752.84 levels of dopamine receptors.
4754.71 So it's not the caffeine is bad.
4756.082 In fact, caffeine can
be neuroprotective,
4757.79 it can enhance
focus and so forth.
4759.81 But divergent thinking
is anti focus.
4762.74 It requires just
enough focus to be
4764.24 able to come up with new ideas.
4766.19 But you actually don't
want to be overly focused.
4768.68 Focus is more conducive
to convergent thinking.
4771.058 In fact, that's exactly
what the literature
4772.85 shows, is that caffeine because
its effects on epinephrine
4776.24 and related systems in
the brain like adenosine.
4778.64 But mainly because
of its effects
4780.26 on persistence and
focus is very conducive
4783.26 to convergent thinking.
4784.82 So if you're somebody who
wants to explore creativity
4788.18 and wants to get
better at creativity,
4789.83 you now know that
you need to engage
4791.51 in divergent thinking and then
afterwards convergent thinking.
4795.89 I would recommend not using
stimulants such as caffeine
4799.37 prior to divergent thinking
but rather use stimulants
4802.94 if you do want to use
stimulants such as caffeine
4805.49 prior to convergent thinking.
4807.59 And in fact, in formulating
the architecture
4810.47 of today's episode,
which took me
4812.75 many hours across many
different days I confess,
4815.36 I actually decided to try this.
4817.1 In trying to imagine the
different configurations
4819.47 and ways that this
information can be organized,
4821.667 I deliberately
abstained from caffeine
4823.25 during those bouts of work.
4824.75 And when structuring
everything according
4827.66 to the decisions I
had already made,
4830.03 I purposely ingested
caffeine prior to that.
4833.07 Now, of course, constructing
a podcast episode
4836.36 is not really the ultimate
example of a creative act
4840.062 because, of course, it's
taking existing information.
4842.27 It's arranging in a novel ways.
4843.562 But it doesn't necessarily
allow key concepts
4845.93 to pop out in the way
that, for instance,
4848.21 Banksy or a Rothko or
an Escher would pop out.
4851.33 I'm certainly not naive
in thinking that it does.
4853.85 But the principle of is
what's important here.
4857.403 You need divergent thinking.
4858.57 You need convergent thinking.
4859.778 You need some level
of elevated dopamine
4862.19 in order to engage in
divergent thinking.
4865.01 But not so high that it starts
to inhibit that process.
4868.025 Now, if you were to come
into the laboratory,
4869.9 this could be measured by
your frequency of blinking.
4872.5 For better or for
worse, we can't actually
4874.25 count the number of times that
we blink unless we're actively
4876.86 paying attention to it.
4877.74 So I don't recommend that you
pay attention to your blinking
4879.38 because that will take
you off course from all
4881.09 the other important
things of your life.
4882.86 And how many times
you're blinking
4884.42 is rarely an important thing
for you to pay attention to.
4887.72 You can however, learn to
calibrate your mood that is,
4891.14 to assess your mood whether
or not you're in low, medium,
4894.93 or high mood.
4896.0 No problem using
that broad binning.
4898.67 You could scale it on 1 to 10.
4899.92 And then decide
whether or not you're
4901.462 going to use some
dopamine elevating
4903.05 stimulus from the outside.
4904.28 Again, could be music, could be
exercise, is an excellent way
4907.657 to elevate dopamine.
4908.49 I'll talk about another
well-established one
4910.43 from the research
literature that
4912.32 is known to elevate dopamine by
65% in the particular pathway
4917.99 that's relevant for
divergent thinking
4920.12 and to do that without
any pharmacology.
4921.908 I'll share that with
you in a moment.
4923.45 But you need to decide
for you in a given moment
4926.99 or in a given work attempt
at creativity what you need
4930.62 and apply accordingly.
4931.86 Because as Chermahini and Hommel
have shown, whether or not
4936.23 you are in a low mood,
medium mood, or high mood,
4938.972 really can determine
whether or not
4940.43 you'll be able to access
divergent thinking or not.
4943.58 Now, if you're somebody who
already has an idea in mind,
4946.43 you're very excited
about a creative idea
4948.26 and you want to hone it,
you want to shape it,
4950.82 you want to pressure test it.
4952.26 We'll talk a little
bit more about what
4953.885 that means in a three step
process in just a little bit.
4957.69 I would strongly
encourage you to look
4960.48 at that process is a very
linear process in which there
4963.42 are right and wrong answers.
4965.38 And there, the use of caffeine
at appropriate dosages
4968.61 and dosages for
caffeine that are safe
4970.83 and in fact,
performance enhancing
4972.33 were covered in the
episode on caffeine turns
4974.205 out it's 1 to 3 milligrams
per kilogram of body weight,
4977.47 by the way.
4978.27 And if you want to
leverage caffeine or maybe
4981.21 even other forms of
healthy legal stimulants,
4984.75 those are covered in
the caffeine episode.
4986.5 And I'll talk about a few
more a little bit later.
4988.583 So to summarize this
segment and also
4990.203 just to make a
more general point,
4991.62 I think it's very
useful for people
4993.09 to start to pay attention to
what their tonic level, that
4996.66 is their baseline
level of dopamine
4998.94 ought to be in this
nigrostriatal circuit
5002.6 and in other circuits.
5003.56 And to do that by learning
to assess one's mood
5006.14 and pay attention to what
mood they happen to be in.
5009.02 And then to leverage tools.
5010.49 Behavioral tools, maybe
pharmacologic tools
5012.405 provided they're safe
and they're legal
5014.03 in order to either
increase dopamine
5016.64 or to elect not to
increase dopamine in order
5019.55 to access the creative process.
5021.195 Now, I've mentioned
pharmacology a few times.
5023.07 And I'd like to talk about
that just a little bit more
5025.32 in the context of dopamine.
5026.78 First of all, there is
no supplement or drug
5030.89 that you or anyone else can
take that will selectively
5035.33 elevate dopamine in only
one of the four circuits
5039.23 that I described before.
5040.73 This is just the state of
the technology nowadays.
5043.19 If you take a pill
or even if you
5045.14 were to inject some
substance, again, I
5046.94 hope this would be legal
and safe, et cetera.
5050.36 Whatever mode of delivery,
there is no technology
5053.84 that exists at this time that
would allow you to selectively
5057.23 amplify dopamine.
5058.46 For instance, just in the
nigrostriatal pathway or just
5061.688 in the means of
mesocortical pathway.
5063.23 Again, the nigrostriatal
pathway associated
5065.022 with diversion thinking, the
music mesocortical pathway
5067.37 associated with cognitive
persistence and convergent
5070.43 thinking.
5072.12 If you were to amplify
dopamine levels, for instance,
5074.79 by taking the amino
acid precursor
5076.56 to dopamine
L-Tyrosine, something
5078.27 that I occasionally
do to enhance
5079.86 dopamine levels for
sake of work or energy,
5082.02 500 milligrams or 1,000
milligrams even of L-Tyrosine.
5085.02 Sometimes I'll combine that with
other things like Alpha-GPC.
5087.63 It's going to enhance
dopamine transmission
5090.45 in the nigrostriatal pathway,
the mesocortical pathway,
5093.48 but also in the
mesolimbic pathway,
5095.13 and also, for that matter in
the tuberoinfundibular pathway
5098.35 associated with the pituitary.
5099.6 There is no way to direct
dopamine activation
5103.11 to just one of those pathways.
5105.19 That's just a reflection
of the existing technology.
5108.22 Now, this is also true if
you rely on illicit drugs
5112.14 to increase dopamine.
5113.05 So if it's cocaine
or methamphetamine,
5114.633 those will greatly increase
dopamine but nonselectively
5118.38 across all those
different pathways.
5120.54 And likewise with any drugs that
inhibit or block or antagonize
5125.01 as it's called dopamine.
5126.6 This is why people who, for
instance, have schizophrenia
5129.78 and take drugs to suppress
auditory hallucinations, some
5133.35 of those drugs work because they
block the so-called D2 receptor
5137.45 of the dopamine pathway.
5138.45 D2 receptors are
present in all four
5140.76 of the dopaminergic
pathways in the brain.
5142.68 And oftentimes, those
drugs will in fact
5145.47 suppress psychotic symptoms,
auditory hallucinations,
5147.78 et cetera, because
they reduce dopamine.
5149.76 But those people oftentimes will
have problems with movement.
5152.85 They will express what's called
in the clinical literature
5155.91 tardive dyskinesia.
5157.71 Writhing of the
face and the body
5159.9 from suppression
of dopamine within
5162.698 the nigrostriatal pathway, which
is associated with movement.
5165.24 They will sometimes have
deficits in eye blinking.
5167.82 People with Parkinson's
who actually
5169.83 have selective deficits of
dopamine within the substantia
5173.04 nigra.
5173.73 Nigrostriatal, remember,
it's substantia nigra
5176.13 show deficits in what?
5177.435 In movement.
5178.18 In the smoothness of movement.
5179.43 Oftentimes they
won't blink at all.
5181.29 They'll have a blank stare.
5182.82 And they have other
issues as well.
5184.69 So if you're somebody who
is interested in increasing
5187.83 dopamine through the use
of legal safe pharmacology
5191.43 as I would hope it
would be the case,
5193.93 there are ways to
do that, reasonably
5195.78 safely for most people.
5196.74 Again, people with
bipolar disorder issues,
5198.66 with the dopaminergic
pathway should not do this.
5200.85 I know nowadays there's
a lot of use of drugs
5204.39 that increase dopamine such as
Ritalin, Adderall, modafinil,
5210.51 armodafinil, often prescribed
for things like attention
5213.63 deficit hyperactivity disorder.
5214.98 We did an entire episode
on ADHD and pharmacologic,
5217.86 prescription, supplement, and
behavioral, nutritional tools
5220.77 for ADHD.
5221.4 You can find that episode
at hubermanlab.com.
5223.77 I know a number of people
take those compounds in order
5226.59 to increase dopamine and
focus for sake of studying
5231.03 or other activities staying
up long hours, et cetera.
5234.12 And the fact that
they increase focus,
5235.95 they are effective although
they do have their side effects.
5238.86 Sometimes severe, sometimes
habit forming, sometimes
5241.47 even addicting as well.
5242.898 But the fact that
they increase focus
5244.44 should automatically
tell you something
5246.27 that those drugs in
particular increase
5249.54 dopamine in the
so-called mesocortical
5253.86 and mesolimbic pathways.
5255.75 Why can I say that?
5257.128 How can I say that with
any degree of confidence?
5259.17 Well, there are these four
pathways ones involved
5261.33 in movement, but
these other ones
5263.73 are involved in motivation
and desire and reward.
5266.85 And I told you that
these things can
5268.35 be habit forming and
addicting in some cases
5270.21 and they are can
greatly increase focus.
5272.91 And focus is supported by
enhanced levels of dopamine
5276.78 within this mesolimbic
and mesocortical pathway.
5280.66 So yes, those drugs increase
dopamine across the board,
5283.5 but there does seem to be
some weighting of dopamine
5285.96 toward the systems involved
in motivation and reward
5288.66 and sometimes even leading to
habit formation and addiction.
5291.27 That's why those
drugs should only
5293.67 be taken with the close
supervision of a very
5297.48 skilled psychiatrist or somebody
else who's board certified
5300.75 who can really govern that.
5303.33 There are however, ways
to increase dopamine
5306.03 more evenly across the
board using nonprescription
5308.77 approaches.
5309.27 And one I already
mentioned, which
5310.74 is L-Tyrosine taken
typically in dosages
5313.44 of 500 to 1,000 milligrams.
5315.12 L-Tyrosine is not as potent
in increasing dopamine
5318.18 as are the prescription drugs
that I referred to before.
5322.5 Tends to be milder.
5323.49 For some people it can have
a very amplified effect.
5325.95 They feel it right away.
5327.01 It's very intense in
elevating focus and motivation
5330.42 and the desire to move.
5332.4 For other people,
it's less potent.
5335.053 It really depends on
a number of things.
5336.72 I should mention that regular
consumption of caffeine
5339.54 of 1 to 3 milligrams per
kilogram of body weight per day
5342.54 also will increase dopamine
receptor efficacy and density,
5346.78 which will make any existing
dopamine more effective
5349.95 whether or not that dopamine
is triggered by things
5352.26 like L-Tyrosine, or if
you're not taking anything
5354.63 to elevate dopamine.
5355.72 The dopamine that
you do make will
5357.21 be more effective in elevating
your mood, motivation,
5360.57 and desire to move.
5362.52 And by extension
divergent thinking.
5364.95 If you are consuming
caffeine, but, again, caffeine
5367.44 should be taken prior to
convergent thinking type task
5369.69 probably more than it
should be taken prior
5371.77 to divergent thinking task.
5373.3 And, of course, there are
other legal supplements
5375.67 that can elevate
dopamine as well
5377.08 and particular phenethylamine
is very effective in doing that.
5379.96 600 milligrams of that
has a brief effect lasting
5383.44 only about 30 to 45 minutes.
5384.982 But it is one that
many people find
5386.44 beneficial for sake of studying
or for creative thinking
5389.44 and so on and so forth.
5390.65 Now, that's pharmacology.
5391.93 And in fact, there's
an extensive landscape
5394.028 of prescription and
supplement based pharmacology
5396.07 and indeed nutrition.
5397.9 For instance, the
consumption of foods
5399.76 that are high in L-Tyrosine
such as aged Parmesan cheese,
5403.153 for instance, of all things.
5404.32 Very, very high in L-Tyrosine.
5405.76 The precursor to dopamine.
5407.2 Certain foods.
5408.1 You can look up
online which foods
5409.57 contain high levels
of L-Tyrosine
5411.34 and which ones are compatible
with your nutrition.
5413.59 But leaving pharmacology
aside, there's
5416.98 a very exciting
nonpharmacological tool.
5420.49 A purely behavioral tool
that the research literature
5424.0 has told us can selectively
increase dopamine
5427.87 within the
nigrostriatal pathway.
5430.75 The pathway that's involved
in divergent thinking.
5433.12 And can do so very dramatically
as much as 65% above baseline.
5437.98 And so this is a
behavioral tool that
5440.56 is useful for a number of things
but that I find particularly
5443.47 interesting in leveraging
towards the exploration
5446.62 and enhancement of creativity
because first of all,
5448.85 it's purely behavioral.
5449.86 So it's 0 cost.
5451.63 And it involves no manipulation
of brain neuromodulators
5456.7 or chemistry through
pharmacology.
5458.38 So it's something that you
can explore very safely
5461.17 and certainly not having
to purchase anything.
5463.21 And what's really remarkable
is the selectivity
5466.57 or I think it's fair to
say the immense selectivity
5469.42 that this particular
behavioral intervention seems
5472.3 to exert on dopamine within
this pathway associated
5475.9 with divergent thinking.
5477.1 So the study that
I'm about to describe
5478.96 is a study that
dates back 20 years.
5481.425 Now, that should
not concern you.
5482.8 In fact, the early arrival
of this study or what
5487.15 now seems to be early arrival.
5488.5 I mean, it wasn't that long
ago, is really exciting
5491.89 because the first
line of this study
5493.78 really illustrates how important
or how much of a landmark study
5497.86 this really is.
5498.53 And so I'll just read you
the first line of the study,
5500.35 then I'll tell you
the title, then I'll
5501.975 tell you what they discovered
in fairly top contour
5504.965 and we will provide
a link to the study
5506.59 if you want to peruse
it in more detail.
5509.06 The first line of the study
is this is the first in vivo,
5512.23 just meaning in the organism.
5513.73 In this case, this
was a study on humans.
5516.05 This is the first in
vivo demonstration
5518.17 of an association between an
endogenous neurotransmitter
5521.68 release, endogenous means within
us, and conscious experience.
5525.677 So what this sentence
essentially says
5527.26 is this is the first study
exploring how a chemical that's
5529.84 naturally released in our body
relates to a particular quality
5534.07 of conscious experience.
5536.02 This study was performed
in Scandinavia,
5538.66 in one of the
hospitals in Denmark.
5540.853 Again, we'll provide a link.
5542.02 The first author is Kjaer.
5543.443 I think I'm pronouncing it
correctly although probably not
5545.86 K-J-A-E-R et al.
5549.1 And the title of the
study is Increased
5550.99 Dopamine Tone During
Meditation Induced
5552.94 Change of Consciousness.
5554.152 And I want to just highlight
that the meditation used
5556.36 in this study isn't really
a meditation at all.
5558.65 I don't know why they
selected that for the title.
5560.83 The behavioral protocol
used in the study
5563.11 was more akin to what is
normally called yoga nidra
5566.68 or NSDR nonsleep depressed.
5569.51 Now yoga nidra and NSDR have
been discussed many times
5572.02 before on this podcast.
5573.52 Yoga nidra, for
instance, is a practice
5575.35 that's been around for hundreds
if not thousands of years
5577.725 in which people
deliberately lie still.
5580.15 So they're forcing themselves
to be mostly motionless,
5583.42 small movements are fine.
5585.19 And they're directing
their attention
5586.78 to the surface of
their body, they're
5588.01 doing long exhale breathing.
5589.21 Sometimes some intentions,
sometimes some visualization.
5592.51 But it's really
self-directed relaxation.
5595.06 And the key component is that
people stay awake and engage
5598.96 in very little movement.
5600.91 And the key word
there is movement.
5602.74 Now, nonsleep depressed is a
acronym, a term that I coined.
5607.6 It's not a term that
I coined in order
5609.64 to try and wipe away or
discard with yoga nidra.
5612.76 I'm a person who has
great respect for yoga
5615.7 nidra and its traditions.
5616.99 It's a term that
I coined in order
5619.63 to encompass a number of
practices that don't include
5622.66 any mystical type language
or scientific language
5626.073 for that matter.
5626.74 And that doesn't
involve intentions.
5628.6 It involves deep relaxation
yet remaining wide awake
5632.29 and conscious.
5632.95 Sometimes people fall
asleep and that's OK.
5634.87 But this is really an
atypical brain state
5637.51 of being deeply relaxed yet in
general awake and motionless.
5643.48 Again, motionless being the key.
5645.55 Very few brain states involve us
being mostly if not completely
5649.54 motionless and yet awake.
5650.66 And it turns out that
brain state whether or not
5652.66 you call it yoga nidra,
you call it NSDR,
5654.82 whether or not you call it
meditation induced shift
5657.58 in consciousness as
they did in this study,
5660.32 although they do
refer to yoga nidra,
5662.23 all refer to the same thing,
which is being motionless
5665.62 and yet aware and relaxed.
5668.71 I should mention.
5669.55 So in this study,
what they did was
5671.14 they subjects into
the laboratory.
5673.96 They had them either undergo
this self-directed deep
5678.28 relaxation while they are
motionless or mostly motionless
5681.7 or they had them listen
to an audio script
5684.97 while also just lying
there with eyes closed.
5687.28 And then they used a
number of chemical tricks.
5689.448 And I don't want to
get too deep into those
5691.24 now because they can be
a little bit distracting.
5692.77 For those of you
that are interested,
5693.86 you can look at it in the study.
5695.193 This is a binding of a
chemical in the brain
5697.287 that then they can image
with brain imaging, which
5699.37 is what they did in the study
to evaluate how much dopamine
5703.06 changed in the brain
and where specifically
5705.13 in the brain dopamine
changed its levels before,
5708.44 during, and after this
particular behavioral practice
5711.91 in one or the other group.
5713.2 And what they discovered
is that people
5716.02 who did this deep
relaxation, that
5718.21 is, self-directed deep
relaxation lying their eyes
5722.05 closed, relatively motionless
although small movements
5727.24 of the body or movements of
the head are absolutely fine.
5730.57 What they observed was a 65%
increase in dopamine release.
5735.49 Now, here its key.
5736.27 Dopamine release.
5738.07 And they observed an increase
in so-called theta activity.
5741.49 Theta activity is a pattern
of brain wave activity that's
5745.21 commonly associated
with creative states
5747.85 and divergent thinking
in particular.
5749.42 So that's important.
5751.25 And they observe
that across subjects
5753.79 specifically in the
nigrostriatal pathway.
5756.14 This pathway associated
with divergent thinking.
5758.42 So this is very exciting.
5759.693 This is a study
that really points
5761.11 to a behavioral tool that can
be used to selectively elevate
5764.68 dopamine in the very pathway
that one would want to if they
5768.52 wanted to engage divergent
thinking for sake
5770.44 of creative exploration.
5772.18 There are also a number of key
observations within this study.
5775.66 First of all, the reduction in
bodily movement was essential.
5781.19 In fact, when people rated or
when the amount of readiness
5786.46 for action in their system,
their body was evaluated.
5790.33 What people found was that
immediately after this practice
5793.36 they felt very still.
5795.04 In other words, they felt as
if remaining still was natural.
5797.833 Now it's not the case
that they couldn't move.
5799.75 In fact, the
elevation in dopamine
5801.19 that occurred during
this practice, this yoga
5804.88 nidra-like nonsleep or
NSDR-like practice, actually
5808.96 prepared them to be able to
move in a much more dedicated
5813.58 and robust way afterwards.
5814.845 But during the practice,
their readiness for action
5816.97 went way, way down.
5817.762 Not surprising.
5818.5 They were pretty
much motionless.
5820.21 But interestingly, as the
level of readiness for movement
5825.16 went down, down,
down, down down,
5826.84 their degree of
visual imagery, that
5829.51 is, their internal
landscape and their ability
5832.39 to imagine new things increased.
5835.57 And in fact, areas
of the brain that
5837.64 are associated
with visual imagery
5839.14 such as the visual or
so-called occipital
5841.72 cortex and the parietal cortex
has been shown in other studies
5844.96 to ramp up when
people are motionless.
5846.973 So there seems to be
this inverse relationship
5848.89 between movement and visual
imagery which makes sense.
5851.597 When we're moving
we can pay attention
5853.18 to things in the
outside world, we
5854.89 tend to be aware of our sensory
environment to varying degrees.
5858.13 But we don't tend to be very
focused on visual imagery
5860.8 within our head whereas when we
lie down or sit down and close
5863.74 our eyes and we are motionless,
the degree of visual imagery
5866.35 really increases.
5868.03 Hence, the increase
in divergent thinking
5870.52 because what
essentially is happening
5872.11 is the library of
options, the library
5875.29 of possible interactions
with whatever it
5877.13 is that you're thinking about.
5878.38 I gave the example, which
is a trivial one on purpose
5880.588 of a pen.
5881.23 But the bank of options
that becomes available
5884.83 when we are motionless
and when we are limiting
5886.96 our visualization of
the external world
5890.2 increases exponentially.
5892.295 So this is important.
5893.17 And what it points
to is the fact
5894.58 that this very simple completely
nonpharmacologic behavioral
5898.03 practice of lying
down motionless
5900.0 for some period of time.
5901.0 And I confess the amount
of time that they use
5902.92 in the study was quite long.
5904.91 It was longer than 60 minutes.
5906.94 But all the data that I'm aware
of in terms of NSDR and yoga
5910.87 nidra, and there's a
growing body of literature
5912.85 on these practices
I should mention,
5915.01 show that even 10
minutes or even better
5918.79 would be 20 or 30 minutes
of lying motionless
5921.49 with eyes closed and
allowing the mind to drift,
5925.3 wherever it happens
to go, but focusing
5929.14 on relaxing by doing
long exhale breathing,
5931.69 perhaps doing a body
scan or focusing
5933.61 your attention on
particular body parts
5935.83 but not keeping it focused
on any one particular body
5938.23 part for that long, that general
practice of deep relaxation
5941.86 while awake and being
relatively motionless really
5944.92 favors the brain
states associated
5946.95 with divergent thinking.
5947.95 And actually
represents an accessing
5950.62 of the various
components that you would
5952.66 use during divergent thinking.
5954.88 And perhaps most
excitingly, it's
5957.4 associated with this massive
increase, 65% increase
5960.79 in dopamine release within
the very pathway that
5963.4 underlies divergent thinking.
5965.233 So my recommendation
would be for those of you
5967.15 that are trying to
enhance divergent thinking
5969.025 and creative ability, that
you would do this practice
5972.41 at a minimum once per week.
5974.013 And I should say if you were
going to do it once per week,
5976.43 I would recommend doing it
for about 20 to 30 minutes.
5978.92 Some of you might be able to do
it for as long as 60 minutes.
5981.89 I myself do such a practice
on a daily basis, anywhere
5984.89 from 10 minutes to 20
minutes, sometimes 30 minutes.
5988.46 There's an example of an NSDR
script, completely zero cost.
5992.6 I confess it does
happen to be my voice.
5994.61 So forgive me in advance.
5996.47 There are other options of NSDR.
5998.0 You can go to YouTube,
put NSDR and my name.
6000.82 Again, completely zero cost.
6002.14 You can get a sample of
what a 10 minute NSDR
6005.32 script looks like.
6006.22 That's through Virtusan,
put that out there.
6009.14 So thank you Virtusan for
putting that out there
6011.14 at zero cost.
6012.25 There are examples of 20 and
30 minute NSDR scripts and yoga
6016.6 nidra scripts.
6017.35 Some that I particularly like.
6018.8 We will also provide a
link to some of those.
6020.8 Again, those are completely
zero cost for you to explore.
6023.62 But more important than you
follow any one particular yoga
6026.8 nidra NSDR script
is that you learn
6028.96 to take your body and brain into
these states of limited motion,
6034.0 elevated dopamine within
this particular pathway,
6036.61 and fairly deep relaxation.
6038.23 Again, if you happen
to fall asleep,
6039.91 that's not necessarily
a bad thing,
6041.913 although the idea
is that you stay
6043.33 in a shallow plane
of consciousness
6045.13 or sleep hence the term
nonsleep deep rest.
6049.12 So in any event, I think this
is a very useful practice
6051.67 that many people
could benefit from.
6053.17 And the fact that it's zero
cost and purely behavioral,
6055.462 I think adds additional
benefit because it's
6058.355 certainly one that
people could explore
6059.98 depending on what amount of
time you're willing to commit.
6062.8 And the research
data on this now
6065.29 extend beyond this
one individual paper.
6067.42 And I think is really
exciting because what it says
6070.06 is as the title and
first line of the paper
6072.61 suggests is that we
can increase dopamine
6074.74 using specific types
of meditation induced
6077.47 consciousness.
6078.25 And those increases
in dopamine can
6080.47 be used to increase our
ability to be more creative.
6083.32 Before moving forward, I
want to make absolutely clear
6086.23 how it is that you
would use an NSDR a.k.a.
6089.32 yoga nidra or similar,
the name doesn't really
6091.9 matter after all, the
practice is what matters,
6094.66 in order to enhance dopamine
in this nigrostriatal pathway
6099.16 and enhance divergent thinking.
6100.96 The key thing to
understand here is
6103.12 that the period
of motionlessness
6106.12 and deep relaxation
while awake increases
6109.6 dopamine in the
nigrostriatal pathway.
6111.97 It increases mental imagery.
6114.58 That is, it increases access to
the bank or the library, if you
6119.29 will, of possible
solutions or elements
6122.77 to engage in the divergent
thinking process.
6125.35 But divergent thinking
itself does not
6127.87 occur during NSDR a.k.a.
6130.66 yoga nidra.
6132.49 The NSDR and yoga nidra, a
deep relaxation meditation,
6136.13 whatever it is you want to call
it, sets a dopaminergic tone.
6139.635 And that's actually the
appropriate use of the word
6141.76 dopaminergic tone it
raises the baseline
6144.1 of dopamine transmission
in that circuitry that
6147.37 then positions you to
engage in divergent thinking
6150.67 more effectively.
6151.82 So the idea would be to
do anywhere from 10 to 20,
6154.9 maybe 30 minutes, maybe
even as much as an hour,
6157.37 depending on how much time
you had to dedicate of such
6159.91 a meditation and NSDR practice.
6162.13 And then not
necessarily immediately
6164.77 but within the 5 to 15
minutes following, then
6168.79 to go into a practice
of divergent thinking
6171.58 and start doing
creative exploration.
6173.5 That is to start thinking
about different ways
6175.54 to combine existing
elements in whatever domain
6178.0 it is that you want
to achieve creativity.
6180.34 So the point is that the
divergent thinking itself
6183.04 is not occurring during the
NSDR or yoga nidra practice.
6187.48 The NSDR and yoga nidra
practice prepares you
6189.94 for divergent thinking that
you do in the hour or hours
6193.27 that follows.
6194.08 And just to contrast
that with pharmacology,
6196.57 I am not aware of any specific
dopamine related pharmacology
6200.86 that would allow us to
selectively increase dopamine
6203.53 in the very pathway associated
with divergent thinking
6205.99 and creativity.
6207.64 Now, there are forms
of pharmacology
6209.71 that can shift brain
neurotransmitters
6211.99 and modulators in ways
that favor creativity.
6214.438 And this is certainly
a topic that we
6215.98 we'll go into in more
depth in a future episode.
6218.62 But there's an
exciting study that
6220.12 was performed just
this last year looking
6222.4 at the role of serotonin,
another neuromodulator,
6225.91 in divergent and
convergent thinking.
6228.16 And it turns out that serotonin
underlies a lot of the brain
6233.02 activity that's responsible
for both divergent
6235.66 and for convergent thinking.
6237.37 And there's one particular
form of pharmacology
6240.52 which can enhance activation
of the serotonergic pathways
6244.06 associated with the so-called
5-HT, that's serotonin.
6247.72 5-HT, that's the abbreviation.
6249.88 5-HT2A receptor.
6252.88 Serotonin 2A receptor in
particular brain areas
6255.91 in ways that favor both
divergent and convergent
6258.46 thinking.
6259.03 And the pharmacologic
agent in that case
6261.94 turns out to be very low
dose or as some of you
6264.97 may have heard of it referred
to as microdosing of psilocybin.
6269.383 Now, I do want to say because it
would be entirely inappropriate
6272.05 for me to not say this, that
in most areas of the world
6275.747 and particularly in
the United States,
6277.33 psilocybin is still illegal.
6279.25 It is not legal.
6280.42 In some areas it has
been decriminalized
6282.97 and there are a number of
different clinical trials
6285.64 occurring now at Johns
Hopkins, at Stanford,
6288.25 at University of
California, San Francisco,
6290.26 and elsewhere
exploring psilocybin
6292.15 for the treatment of
depression, for trauma,
6294.88 for eating disorders.
6296.53 Most of those studies focus
on macrodoses of psilocybin
6300.25 not microdosing.
6301.3 There are far fewer studies
of microdosing of psilocybin.
6303.85 And I do have to point
out that psilocybin use
6307.09 and possession and, of
course, sale is still illegal.
6310.34 So I would be remiss
if I didn't state that.
6312.86 However, I will provide
a link to the study that
6315.34 shows that microdosing
of psilocybin
6317.62 for a series of weeks
on a daily basis.
6320.54 So these are dosages
of psilocybin
6322.06 that do not induce hallucination
and do not massively
6325.93 shift mood or internal states in
any way that has people feeling
6330.79 like they are acting
or feeling that
6333.145 much different although
some people do report
6335.02 a subjective shift.
6336.34 Does seem to increase
divergent thinking ability.
6340.06 But I do want to put a
big asterisks, a highlight
6343.72 in an underlying beneath the
statement I'm about to make,
6347.12 which is that pharmacology
of the serotonin system
6350.29 just as pharmacology
of the dopamine system
6353.44 is very broadband.
6355.06 It's a shotgun approach.
6356.08 You're going to hit
all the circuits
6357.58 of the brain that
involve serotonin
6359.08 with microdosing psilocybin.
6360.91 Although it has some selectivity
for the 5-HT2A receptor
6364.24 it can attach to other
receptors as well and act there.
6368.39 This is the same reason why
SSRI, Selective Serotonin
6370.81 Reuptake Inhibitors can
indeed shift mood and appetite
6374.26 but it can also shift
libido and other things.
6376.72 It's because there are
serotonin receptors everywhere,
6379.39 or I should say many
places, not just in
6381.982 the areas of the brain that
are associated with mood,
6384.19 for instance.
6385.61 And as I mentioned before,
agents, whether or not they
6389.74 are recreational or illicit
drugs or prescription drugs
6393.1 or supplements that
increase dopamine will also
6396.61 be broadband into a number of
different circuits in parallel.
6399.95 So this is why I always
say behavioral tools really
6404.02 should come first.
6405.22 I don't say that because
I dislike pharmacology,
6407.555 I say that because in many
cases behavioral tools are not
6409.93 only safer and easier
to titrate to adjust
6412.45 the duration, et cetera
than is pharmacology,
6415.33 but also because
they can sometimes
6417.412 as in the case of
the study we just
6418.87 described for you more
specificity not less than
6422.77 pharmacology.
6423.53 Pharmacology has its
place can be wonderful,
6426.52 provided safe and
legal, et cetera.
6428.44 But it can cause a lot of
so-called off target effects.
6431.842 So for those of you that
are interested in increasing
6434.05 creativity through
pharmacology, I
6436.72 would say, stay tuned for
the data on psilocybin
6440.62 and microdosing psilocybin.
6441.88 If you are absolutely obsessed
with the idea of microdosing
6445.93 psilocybin for
enhancing creativity
6447.708 and you'd like to go
straight to the study,
6449.5 I will tell you what that
study is and therefore you
6452.02 can access some of the
specifics in terms of dosages
6454.45 and protocols, et cetera.
6455.56 So since I can't
help myself, I'll
6456.977 just very briefly summarize that
microdosing psychedelic study.
6461.18 The title of the study,
which was published in 2018
6464.38 is Exploring the Effect of
Microdosing Psychedelics
6466.6 on Creativity in an Open
Label Natural Setting.
6470.26 Interesting title.
6471.22 This was a microdosing
event organized
6473.53 by the Dutch
psychedelic society.
6475.6 They examined the effects
of psychedelic truffles
6478.24 where they knew what psychedelic
compounds were contained there
6482.65 on two creativity related
problem solving task,
6486.13 the picture concept task, which
I don't expect you to recognize
6489.46 or know but it assesses
convergent thinking
6491.83 and the alternative
uses task which
6494.447 I also don't expect
you to know but is
6496.03 a standard task for
assessing divergent thinking.
6498.67 They tested once before
taking a microdose
6501.07 and while the effects were
expected to be manifested
6503.92 they say.
6504.79 Interesting.
6505.3 They use the word manifested
in a study of psychedelics.
6507.633 Science is changing indeed.
6510.25 In any case, what they found
was an enhancement of creative.
6516.13 That is, divergent and
convergent thinking
6519.25 not surprising given the
fact that the 5-HT2A receptor
6524.05 activity is increased by
microdosing of psilocybin
6528.46 and 5-HT2A receptors are present
both on the neural circuits
6532.45 that underlie divergent
and convergent thinking.
6535.54 So, again, this is not a plug
for microdosing psilocybin.
6540.34 This is really in
response to what
6542.315 I know will be a number of
different questions about what
6544.69 pharmacologic agents can be
used to increase creativity.
6548.02 So more on that later
and, again, we'll
6549.91 provide a link if you want to
read that study in more depth.
6553.84 I can imagine that
a number of you
6555.31 are probably also wondering
about the effects of alcohol
6557.94 and the effects of
cannabis on creativity.
6559.69 We did a long in-depth
episode all about alcohol
6562.87 and its effects on health.
6564.85 The bottom line on
alcohol is that in excess
6568.055 of two drinks per
week, you're starting
6569.68 to run into the cancer promoting
and toxic effects of alcohol.
6573.55 I didn't choose for
the answer to be that,
6576.62 but that's what
the data tell us.
6579.46 I'm not telling you you can't
drink more than two drinks
6581.83 per week, I'm just saying that
if you're going to do that,
6583.58 you should really
consider offsetting
6585.64 that with some other
behavioral measures
6587.62 all discussed in the
episode on alcohol.
6589.39 And despite what
people think, there
6592.12 is absolutely zero evidence that
alcohol increases creativity.
6597.31 However, by way of
reducing activation
6600.55 of the prefrontal cortex,
there is some evidence
6603.28 that alcohol and
other substances
6605.26 that reduce what's called
autobiographical scripting,
6608.65 that is, a narrative
about ourselves,
6612.5 so self awareness, that it
can enhance divergent thinking
6615.97 at very low doses.
6617.435 And this makes sense.
6618.31 Divergent thinking involves
remembering certain things
6621.43 that we can use as elements
in the creative process
6623.77 but suppressing narratives
about what the use of those
6626.89 would mean.
6627.46 Will people like it?
6628.36 Will they not like it?
6629.41 Will it to the outcome we want?
6630.55 Well, it won't.
6631.18 All of that
autobiographical scripting
6633.01 involves the forebrain
being very, very active
6636.16 and specific regions of the
forebrain in particular.
6638.86 And that all needs
to be suppressed,
6641.56 which alcohol in very
low doses can accomplish.
6644.37 But, again, that's not
a plug for alcohol.
6646.12 I think behavioral tools
would be a much better route.
6648.49 But therefore it
shouldn't be surprising
6651.16 why some people have used
low dose alcohol in order
6653.74 to engage in the
creative process
6655.54 because it involves
less inhibition
6657.19 or sense of self that could be
detrimental to the divergent
6659.89 thinking process.
6660.91 Now, with respect to
cannabis, I went in depth
6664.12 into the biology and the
various uses, misuses,
6667.54 dangers, and in some cases
benefits of cannabis use
6670.72 in certain.
6672.1 The key word there is
certain populations.
6674.63 And I also dove
into whether or not
6677.62 cannabis can be used to increase
divergent and convergent
6680.3 thinking.
6680.8 So that's timestamped
in that episode.
6682.27 I'll refer you to that episode.
6683.562 But the long and short of
it is that many of the ideas
6686.89 that people come up with when
under the influence of cannabis
6690.16 in particular high THC
containing cannabis does lead
6695.53 to enhanced divergent
thinking, but so enhanced
6699.22 it turns out that
oftentimes those ideas can't
6701.8 be constrained by the
convergent thinking process.
6704.27 In other words, they
have lots of ideas
6705.91 that make sense while under
the influence of cannabis.
6709.57 But that later cannot be
implemented into a coherent
6713.83 framework that leads to any
actual creative endeavor
6718.3 or creative product.
6719.92 Or, as is often the
case with cannabis,
6722.17 they simply can't remember
what they were thinking about.
6724.78 Any time there's a
discussion about dopamine,
6727.03 there seems to be a discussion
about motivation, desire,
6729.91 and drive.
6730.54 And, of course, that makes sense
given the roles of dopamine.
6733.09 We did an entire episode
on dopamine, motivation,
6735.18 and drive.
6735.68 It's one of our most
popular episodes.
6737.47 Again, you can access that
with timestamps and all formats
6740.44 at hubermanlab.com.
6742.15 And any time
there's a discussion
6743.59 about dopamine and
motivation, we also
6746.95 seem to have a lot of questions
about attention and focus
6750.22 and ADHD or attention
deficit hyperactivity
6752.98 disorder in particular.
6754.58 So just as a brief
mention, there
6756.52 is a literature although
not terribly extensive,
6759.4 a small but strong literature
on the relationship
6762.58 between ADHD and creativity.
6764.89 And the long and short
of that literature
6766.63 is that people who have
ADHD regardless of age
6770.5 do seem to have an
ability to focus.
6773.11 I've mentioned that
in the episode on ADHD
6775.09 provided that they are
interested in the thing
6777.79 that they are focusing on.
6779.09 So that runs counter to this
idea that people with ADHD
6781.57 simply can't focus.
6782.53 They can but it tends to be a
focus that selective for things
6785.62 that they are very excited about
or interested in as opposed
6788.47 to a general ability to focus.
6790.93 What's also highly
underappreciated
6793.75 is that people who
have ADHD oftentimes
6797.26 are very effective
at divergent thinking
6799.9 but are less effective
at convergent thinking.
6802.72 What this tells us is
that people with ADHD
6805.0 can often have excellent novel
and indeed creative ideas,
6809.5 but that the implementation
of those creative ideas
6812.32 is sometimes challenge.
6813.43 And that's one reason to
explore rational pharmacology,
6816.22 nutrition,
supplementation, et cetera.
6818.05 Those are all things
to explore in concert
6820.15 with or I should say in
working closely with a board
6823.33 certified physician or ideally
psychiatrist expert in ADHD.
6826.948 You can also check out the
episode that we did on ADHD.
6829.24 There are a lot of tools there.
6830.532 A lot of science mentioned
there to support those tools.
6833.2 Again, you can find
that Hubermanlab.com.
6835.15 But I did think it was
important to point out,
6837.35 even if briefly that having ADHD
is not a barrier to creativity
6841.99 and, in fact, may actually be
an enhanced portal to creativity
6845.71 but that it doesn't
allow people to access
6848.44 the convergent thinking that
allows creative ideas to be
6852.1 implemented into specific
strategies, pressure tested,
6854.95 and eventually delivered in
the form of a final product
6857.92 of music, art, et cetera.
6859.63 That is not to say that people
with ADHD cannot accomplish
6862.69 that, but that it is going to
require some additional steps
6865.63 and protocols in order to
enhance convergent thinking.
6868.81 And that episode and
the episode that we
6870.49 did on focus and in particular
tools to enhance focus
6874.3 is very much directed at ways
to enhance convergent thinking.
6878.26 So if you have ADHD or
know somebody who does
6880.45 and you're interested
in the creative process,
6882.367 we're focusing generally
please check out the episodes
6884.77 that I mentioned.
6885.58 Now, there's also a small
but nonetheless very exciting
6887.98 literature on the relationship
between physical movement
6890.74 and divergent thinking.
6892.13 This should come as
no surprise to us.
6894.28 As mentioned many times
now in this episode,
6896.53 the nigrostriatal pathway
involved in divergent thinking
6899.17 that involves dopamine is also
responsible for eye blinks
6902.56 and for movements of the
limbs of the body in very
6905.92 deliberate ways.
6907.36 This tells us that there's
some direct or maybe
6910.75 indirect relationship
between movement
6912.67 of the body and
divergent thinking.
6915.207 And despite the fact that
it's only a few studies,
6917.29 there have been some studies
of whether or not people are
6919.9 able to engage in
divergent thinking
6921.7 more effectively when
they are doing things
6923.86 like pacing or walking.
6926.277 And this could be on a
treadmill or back and forth
6928.36 across the room.
6929.17 And in fact, that is
absolutely the case.
6931.36 If you're somebody
like myself who
6933.25 tends to have their
best ideas, not
6936.55 saying that my ideas are always
terrific, but among the ideas
6939.58 I have, some of the better
ones arrive to me while
6942.28 on my long Sunday run.
6944.08 I tend to do a long
run or hike on Sundays
6946.63 sometimes with a light weight
vest or something of that sort.
6949.58 But when I'm in a state
of essentially not
6952.3 directing my attention
to any one thing
6954.73 in my external environment, this
is extremely key for reasons
6957.475 that now should be obvious.
6958.6 Any time we are
directing our attention
6960.225 to a visual target
or an auditory target
6962.77 we are not as able to engage
in divergent thinking.
6965.38 This is why I will
sometimes listen
6967.42 to podcasts or to audiobooks
while I go on these runs.
6970.09 But for portions of
these runs or hikes
6971.74 I tend to turn those off and
just focus on the movement
6975.07 and focus on not focusing
on anything in particular.
6977.65 And oftentimes I will stop and
write down ideas that suddenly
6981.19 or seemingly suddenly appear
to me or geyser to the surface.
6985.12 I'll have an idea.
6985.87 Sometimes those are good ideas,
sometimes less good ideas.
6988.3 The fact that happens
for me and the fact
6990.37 that many people are
pacers or runners
6993.04 or come up with their best
ideas while in the shower
6995.35 or while engaging in
activities that don't require
6998.02 a lot of sensory
attention to one
6999.88 specific location either
visual or auditory,
7002.58 et cetera, that is because it
engages these nigrostriatal
7007.29 pathways through movement
which then opens up
7010.53 this library of ideas and
allows the intersection
7013.38 of different ideas that
normally would be constrained
7015.9 to separate categories.
7017.46 One way to think
about this by analogy
7019.53 would be when I was a kid
you'd go to the library,
7022.62 nowadays you just go online.
7023.79 But the different pages
of different books
7025.74 on different topics are kept
distinct from one another.
7028.89 That is bound by different
book covers and book
7031.68 ends, different
shelves in the library.
7034.807 It's as if different pages
and elements from those books
7037.14 are now being combined
in a pseudo random.
7039.96 Not random but in a
pseudo random way.
7042.48 And in that combination,
new possibilities
7045.48 about ways that information
could be combined
7047.58 and implemented start to arise.
7050.05 So the tool that emerges
from this is very simple.
7052.32 And it won't necessarily
apply to everybody.
7054.79 But if you are
somebody who finds
7056.31 that just sitting in a chair
and trying to be creative
7058.56 is very challenging, some
of you might benefit from,
7061.025 for instance, if
you are engaging
7062.4 in writing or you want to
write to talk into the voice
7066.42 recorder of your phone while
walking or simply walking
7069.06 and not attending to any
one specific thing visually
7071.91 or through headphones.
7072.87 And then as ideas
surface, seemingly
7076.71 out of nowhere, which
is how it happens,
7078.483 that you could either
put them into your phone
7080.4 by voice dictation or you could
type them out if you like.
7082.817 The key thing is to
not be distracted
7084.42 by other things
in your phone, not
7085.842 to start going onto social
media or doing phone calls
7088.05 or looking at text messages
because that by definition
7090.72 is going to take you out
of this what biologists
7093.99 call a pseudo random walk.
7095.91 And this pseudo random element
is extremely important.
7099.94 We know, for instance, that
many circuits within the brain
7102.69 have what's called dedicated
point to point wiring.
7105.21 So, for instance,
the brain circuits
7106.815 that govern your breathing.
7107.94 The brain circuits that
govern your heartbeat.
7109.857 The brain circuits that
govern your specific movements
7112.42 once you are an adult and allow
for smooth directed movement
7115.59 are very precise, very little
slop if any in the wiring.
7119.55 However, there are aspects of
your brain circuitry, yours
7123.75 and everybody
else's I should say,
7126.73 that are maintained
into adulthood that
7129.18 include a lot of extra wiring.
7132.09 And these are fine wires.
7133.59 They are not the major highways
between different areas,
7135.97 if you will.
7136.54 So like Google Maps has highways
and streets and little passages
7141.09 and alleys.
7141.75 But it's as if
there's a little web
7143.7 of additional possible pathways
cast over that entire thing.
7147.54 The human brain maintains
such webs of possible passage.
7151.71 And it's only during activities
such as walking, running,
7156.25 cycling, swimming,
hiking, pacing, et
7160.76 cetera that the activation of
those pseudo random pathways
7164.76 starts to ramp up.
7166.24 So this is a purely
behavioral approach
7168.99 to engaging different elements
within neural networks that
7172.35 normally would not
communicate with one another
7174.39 when we are completely still.
7175.83 So again, the
practices that I talked
7177.64 about earlier of being
completely still to raise
7179.64 dopamine and enhanced
divergent thinking--
7182.49 I just want to
reemphasize are designed
7185.76 to position you to
ready you to engage
7188.82 in the activities like
walking and pacing,
7191.22 et cetera, that best
facilitate divergent thinking.
7194.7 So if you are somebody who wants
to enhance divergent thinking,
7197.61 I would encourage
you to explore how
7199.5 different patterns of movement
in particular, patterns
7201.75 of movement that don't require
any conscious attention
7204.18 to any one specific thing
allow you to access new ideas
7208.65 and new ways of combining
existing elements
7210.96 in whatever domain it is
you want to be creative.
7213.45 Now, this is also an opportunity
to underscore something
7215.982 I said back at the
beginning, which
7217.44 is you are not going to come
up with great works of music
7220.08 if you don't understand
chords and melodies and notes
7224.07 and music.
7224.97 Those basic elements
have to be built up
7226.89 through some formal or at least
rigorous or regular training.
7230.152 In the same way that you're
not going to take a walk,
7232.36 and then suddenly
be able to paint
7233.94 an incredible picture if you
have no painting ability.
7236.19 That is not going to happen.
7237.78 What I'm talking
about here are ways
7239.28 to enhance your capacity
for divergent thinking,
7241.6 such as NSDR and ways to
engage in divergent thinking,
7245.68 such as through certain forms
of movement that don't require
7248.76 a lot of conscious attention
to your surroundings or any one
7251.34 specific sensory target.
7254.1 And in doing so,
enhancing your ability
7256.98 to be more creative in a
domain for which you already
7259.86 have some degree of
skill or even mastery.
7262.65 Now, in keeping with
the theme of how
7264.24 to enhance our
creativity, there's
7266.52 a very exciting and yet parallel
literature to the literature
7271.11 that I've been
describing thus far.
7272.688 Now, I promise you
that I'm not going
7274.23 to open up an entire
library of new information
7277.74 related to neural
circuits and so forth.
7279.7 But I would be remiss
if I didn't mention
7281.91 this parallel literature because
it speaks very specifically
7285.03 to some important practices
that we can all use in order
7288.63 to enhance creativity.
7289.74 And to do so the first
time and every time.
7292.71 And this is really because
certain scientists out there
7295.25 have really gone
through the trouble.
7297.14 I should even say the
painstaking trouble
7299.18 of really trying to dissect
what the creative process is
7302.0 both for individuals and
in groups or even in pairs.
7306.5 And so what I'm about to tell
you is beautifully encapsulated
7309.59 in an article entitled--
7311.81 "A new method for
training creativity--
7314.03 narrative as an alternative
to divergent thinking."
7317.12 So again, we've been talking
about divergent thinking.
7319.37 That's one pathway into
the creative process
7321.83 but there are others as well.
7323.4 And as it turns
out, they're not so
7325.28 distinct in terms of the
underlying brain mechanisms.
7327.71 Nonetheless, let
me describe briefly
7329.54 how narrative can be
used to train creativity
7332.36 and to become more creative.
7333.98 And in order to
do that, I'd like
7335.54 to just briefly
paraphrase or read
7337.22 from the first
paragraph of this paper.
7339.09 So what I'm about to read are
the author's words, not mine.
7342.17 Quote "Here's a paradox.
7344.63 According to current
research young children
7346.88 are more imaginatively
creative than adults."
7349.46 And indeed that is
true, by the way.
7351.59 "Yet also according
to current research,
7354.05 creativity is main neural
engine is divergent thinking,
7357.56 which relies on memory
and logical association
7360.8 to tasks at which young
children underperform adults."
7364.55 That is, children are not as
good at divergent thinking
7368.09 as adults are.
7368.84 So how could it
be the authors are
7370.67 asking that children are
more imaginative and thus
7374.15 more creative than adults.
7375.83 This can only mean that
there are alternate pathways
7379.34 to creativity.
7380.93 And indeed that is the case.
7382.68 And so what this
paper really explores
7385.34 is other ways to
access creativity.
7387.65 And what they describe is
what's called narrative theory.
7390.71 And there's a number
of different aspects
7392.48 to this narrative theory.
7394.64 But they agree that the standard
definition of creativity
7398.24 is the same one that we
were talking about before.
7400.53 So we're not talking about a
different form of creativity,
7402.5 here we're talking
about a different way
7404.167 to access creativity.
7405.2 They describe the standard
definition of creativity
7407.63 as quote "The
ability to generate
7409.28 novel ideas that are useful."
7411.18 So the commonly accepted one.
7412.82 And what they cite as the
basis for narrative theory
7416.87 is this breakthrough
finding in the 1950s.
7419.107 This is the work of Guilford
Some people out there
7421.19 might be familiar with it.
7422.273 I was not at the outset of
researching this episode.
7424.91 What this theory from
Guilford essentially states
7427.497 is that there are different
intellectual capacities that
7429.83 are not captured by
standard IQ tests.
7431.548 I think that's generally
accepted nowadays.
7433.34 We know there's
emotional intelligence,
7435.26 we know the standard
IQ, et cetera.
7437.63 But the important
element to understand
7440.21 is that these authors
were able to trace back
7443.9 the idea of narrative
training as a way
7447.02 to enhance creativity long
before Guilford in the 1950s,
7451.14 all the way back to Aristotle.
7453.273 So this is incredible.
7454.19 Narrative theory
was actually birthed
7455.9 in 335 BCE in his
writing called Poetics,
7460.55 which I think is
incredible at least to me
7464.1 that people long before us
were thinking about creativity
7467.33 and what goes into creativity.
7468.98 And what Aristotle said, what
Guilford then elaborated on
7472.31 and what the authors
of this paper
7474.86 further elaborate
on and actually have
7476.93 developed training
protocols for,
7478.67 is the idea that there are
three elements that we can use
7481.43 in order to enhance creativity.
7482.9 And those three
elements are what's
7485.36 called world
building, I'll explain
7487.52 what these are in a moment,
perspective shifting,
7490.34 and action generating.
7492.17 And right off the
bat, the word action
7494.96 should raise a flag for you.
7496.83 And by that I mean a positive
flag because once again,
7499.46 we are back into the world and
therefore the neural circuits
7502.43 of movement and motion.
7504.77 So three elements of world
building perspective, shifting,
7508.34 and active generating are
what make up this narrative
7510.95 approach to creativity.
7512.24 And I should mention that
these authors and others are
7514.64 using such approach with
companies, with groups,
7517.19 with individuals.
7518.003 So this is using a bunch
of different contexts
7519.92 to approach and enhance
different forms of creativity.
7523.79 So let's talk first about
world building techniques.
7527.19 This is going to be
immediately familiar to you
7530.72 when you hear it.
7531.63 But one of the key elements of
creativity is to at the outset
7536.6 come up with some idea
that makes sense or is
7539.9 attractive to you about how
the world is different inside
7543.47 of your creative endeavor.
7544.92 So for those that
write science fiction
7547.328 or think about
science fiction, there
7548.87 are some obvious
aspects to this.
7550.82 But for those of you
that don't, maybe you
7552.71 come up with a
narrative, for instance,
7554.34 in the context of storytelling
that in your world
7557.33 we are the house
cats and the cats
7561.045 are actually the ones that
are the curators of the Earth.
7563.42 OK.
7563.92 So right there, there
is a conceptual shift
7566.81 that the world in which
whatever creative idea is going
7570.02 to emerge is entirely
different than the one
7572.15 that we actually live in.
7573.32 So that sets a certain number
of important constraints.
7575.782 It means certain things
are now possible,
7577.49 other things are
not possible that
7578.907 are very different from
the world that we live in.
7581.21 You can see the parallels here
to childhood imagination where
7585.025 essentially anything can
happen in the child's mind
7587.15 because they are unconstrained.
7588.56 The second element
is this perspective
7590.27 shifting techniques.
7591.53 And the idea here is
that not only are we
7595.21 supposed to have the reader or
the listener or the observer
7598.99 or us explore for creativity
and develop a creative idea
7603.46 by thinking differently
which is a generic term.
7606.968 How do we actually
think differently.
7608.51 But rather than just say take
the perspective of somebody
7612.34 else in terms of what
they would see or do
7614.5 or say or think
rather, we are supposed
7617.35 to think about their
underlying motivation.
7619.42 So we could do the world shift,
that is the world structure
7622.84 shift from step one.
7623.95 And then in step two, you
would ask yourself OK,
7627.19 rather than write about
or think about or move
7630.37 from the perspective
of myself, let's say,
7632.62 you're feeling particularly
happy that day.
7634.81 You'd say, I'm actually
going to take the perspective
7637.18 of somebody who's angry.
7638.44 But rather than
just act angry, I'm
7640.717 going to think about what their
motivation for being angry is.
7643.3 Maybe they had a breakup.
7645.13 Maybe they were jealous.
7646.21 Maybe somebody had
wronged them in some way.
7648.24 Maybe they're just generally
angry at the world for whatever
7650.74 reason and then operate from
that motivational stance.
7653.77 And this is a very
interesting and powerful step
7656.89 because what it really
captures at least
7659.02 as viewed by me,
the neuroscientists,
7661.06 is it captures a whole set
of neural circuits about what
7663.58 that motivational state means
because motivational states
7666.61 dictate a huge number of
possible different outcomes,
7669.92 but they really constrain the
number of different actions
7673.01 and outcomes that any
of us would engage in.
7674.89 Rather than saying I'm going
to view the world the way
7677.14 that someone else
will view the world,
7678.723 by stating that we are
going to be motivated
7680.68 by their set of motivations
and not our own,
7683.17 it includes a lot more
possibilities and yet not
7686.26 an infinite number
of possibilities.
7687.88 They are constrained
in a logical way,
7689.78 which is one of the key
elements of creativity.
7692.265 And then the third
element, which
7693.64 is action generating techniques
is a really cool one that you
7698.53 will immediately
notice implications
7700.03 for the workplace, which
is forced collaboration.
7703.39 So inside of this thing
that we're building here,
7705.82 this story, you create a
novel rule for the world
7710.35 that your story is
going to exist in
7712.06 or your music is going to exist
in or your sport will exist in.
7716.05 Then you create this
perspective shift
7718.54 where you take on the
motivation of someone
7721.27 else different than
you and then you
7723.64 force collaboration
between that person who
7726.22 has this alternate
motivation different from you
7729.28 and someone else who has an
entirely different motivation.
7731.74 And in doing so,
you create these
7733.57 what are called the
creative collisions.
7735.642 Now they're collisions because
they're crossing one another
7738.1 and something new has
to emerge from them.
7739.85 They could be antagonistic.
7741.59 They could be arguments
fighting physical or verbal
7743.86 or Otherwise they
could be synergistic.
7746.0 They could take on any
number of different forms
7748.0 depending on the motivations
and the individuals that
7750.49 are involved.
7751.46 But even though I
just described this
7753.49 in fairly top contour,
what I just described
7756.22 is actually the core
elements of any story
7759.76 or any creative endeavor.
7760.89 It's just that many stories are
from the perspective of what
7763.39 we already know and believe
and think the world to be.
7767.53 And our own perspective
and the actions
7771.34 that we would take given that
world in that perspective.
7774.13 Whereas if we want
to be creative,
7776.33 we want to think outside
of our usual framework
7778.75 and yet using elements
that exist within us
7781.24 no one has to tell us
the creative narrative.
7783.22 We're trying to come
up with it on our own.
7785.12 We want to essentially
think in a childlike way
7787.93 how do children think?
7789.16 Well, they have new
different or entirely novel
7793.57 concepts about how
the world works.
7795.37 But those are bounded.
7797.202 And this is a key word.
7798.16 Those are bounded.
7798.91 They're not infinite.
7799.785 It's not that
anything can happen.
7801.94 Some kids will say, you can fly
and you can shoot lasers out
7804.482 of your eyes, you
can do all things
7805.94 that are unicorns or candy
falling from the sky.
7808.15 At some point, if you don't
bound the change in the world,
7812.6 it just becomes pure chaos and
even children don't do that.
7815.18 So we need to bound the
change and yet create
7817.45 some alternate universe, if you
will, in which the story takes
7821.26 place or the
creation of any kind,
7823.625 doesn't have to be
a story takes place.
7825.25 Then there has to be
a perspective shift.
7826.81 And this is very useful.
7827.81 This is actually a
tool that we can all
7830.05 use of trying to take
the perspective of others
7832.27 but not just asking what they
would feel or think or do.
7835.99 But ask what is their
motivation in life generally
7839.74 or what mood stance or goal
stance are they taking.
7843.17 Are they trying to
extract from others?
7844.84 Are they trying
to give to others?
7846.28 Are they very altruistic,
et cetera, et cetera.
7848.47 And then you take
that individual
7850.3 and you do that also for
another individual or group
7853.125 of individuals
and then you start
7854.5 thinking about how those
different individuals because
7857.597 of their different
motivational states
7859.18 would engage at the
level of action.
7860.873 What they would do,
what they would say,
7862.54 would they mate,
would they fight,
7863.957 would they-- et
cetera, et cetera.
7865.6 You think of any story.
7866.77 The story of Star Wars,
of the Greek myths.
7869.74 You think of any story that has
been created, which we consider
7874.21 great and novel works.
7876.19 And you start to find these
three elements-- worldbuilding,
7880.27 perspective shifting, and
action generating techniques.
7883.36 And so while this is, again,
just a broad contour of what
7887.59 this narrative
approach involves,
7889.24 I think it's a very
important and very exciting
7891.43 one because it
gives us a formula.
7893.425 We already know that
divergent thinking
7895.05 and convergent thinking
are both elements
7896.758 of the creative process.
7898.44 This is suggesting
that whether or not
7901.17 it involves divergent
thinking or not,
7903.072 these authors seem
to think this is
7904.53 distinct from divergent
thinking that capturing some
7906.96 of the elements of creativity
that are present in childhood
7909.96 but that then tend to
disappear as we start
7911.91 to assume identity, build
identity, and understand rules
7914.82 about the actual
world we live in.
7916.56 All of those basic elements
of early childhood creativity
7920.34 can be reawakened.
7921.343 And, in fact, they have data
to support the fact that they
7923.76 can be reawakened in
adults in meaningful ways
7926.19 that can lead to new product
design, new workplace
7928.62 interactions, and on and on.
7930.6 That I find very exciting.
7932.68 And as a consequence,
I do intend
7935.73 to do an entire episode
at some point on narrative
7938.61 and storytelling.
7939.48 And the role of narrative
and storytelling
7941.34 not just for sake of
creativity but also
7943.23 for accessing neuroplasticity
and for enhancing memory
7947.46 and so on.
7948.01 There's an entire landscape of
literature and exciting tools
7950.55 and things to understand there.
7951.85 But in the meantime, we will
provide a link to this paper.
7954.87 And for those of you that
choose not to access the paper,
7957.45 simply understanding these
three aspects of narrative
7960.96 as an alternative to
accessing creativity.
7963.18 That is, a dedicated and well
understood or established
7967.77 world shift that you choose,
perspective shifting and taking
7971.07 on the motivation of
others, and creating
7974.37 some landscape of exploration
for what interactions would
7977.49 occur between that individual
or groups of individuals
7979.74 and other individuals that
have other motivations
7982.65 and yet are still living
in this alternate world.
7985.86 Those three elements
we now know can
7988.29 be combined into what
you or I or anyone
7991.53 would consider important
creative works.
7993.97 So today we
discussed creativity.
7996.27 This absolutely fascinating
aspect to human brain
7999.63 function that has allowed us as
a species to develop everything
8003.83 from great works
of art and music
8005.87 to technological innovations
that allow us to fly and allow
8009.59 us to access people all over
the world through little screen
8012.23 devices that we carry around
in our pockets and on and on.
8016.615 As I mentioned at the
beginning of today's episode,
8018.74 I find creativity to be one of
the most fascinating aspects
8022.55 of brain function.
8023.96 And in particular,
because we don't actually
8026.81 know what the upper
limits of creativity
8028.58 are and yet we understand
that there are certain bounds,
8032.778 there are certain requirements.
8034.07 And the key requirement
for creativity
8036.11 is this aspect of utility.
8037.7 Now, that doesn't
necessarily mean
8039.2 that for something to
be considered creative
8041.37 it has to be useful in
the practical sense,
8044.18 but it does seem
that for something
8046.13 to be considered truly
creative or especially creative
8050.0 in some cases that
it revealed to us
8052.19 something fundamental about the
way that we or the world works.
8056.338 We discuss some of the
neural circuits that
8058.13 underlie the different
aspects of creativity
8060.14 in particular divergent
and convergent thinking
8062.18 as well as narrative building
and some of the tools
8064.97 and steps that can allow
us to better access
8067.88 divergent thinking and
convergent thinking.
8070.31 And those tools include
behavioral tools as well as
8073.13 pharmacology.
8074.33 And we talked about narrative
building as a way to reawaken
8078.47 or I should say, reaccess
the childhood creativity
8081.83 that did indeed exist in all
of us at some point in time.

8119.66 we've partnered with
Momentous supplements
8121.82 because Momentous supplements
are the very highest quality.
8124.71 They have single
ingredient formulations
8126.74 which turns out to be
most effective in building
8129.213 a supplement protocol.
8130.13 And when I say most
effective I mean,
8131.672 most biologically effective
and most cost effective.
8134.45 And we're fortunate that
they ship internationally
8136.778 because we know that many of
you reside outside of the United
8139.32 States.
8139.82 If you want to check out
the supplements mentioned
8141.903 in today's and in other episodes
of the Huberman Lab podcast,
8144.47 supplements that are
