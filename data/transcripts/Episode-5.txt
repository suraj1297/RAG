0.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the Huberman Lab podcast,
2.25 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
5.7 [MUSIC PLAYING]
9.07 I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor
10.93 of neurobiology
and ophthalmology
12.94 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.41 Today we are
discussing fertility.
16.57 We will discuss male fertility
and female fertility.
19.97 And I should mention that
today's discussion is not just
23.14 for people who are seeking
to conceive children
25.45 or who want to know how their
children were conceived,
27.79 but it's really for everybody.
29.47 And I say that because it
is the story of all of us.
32.95 All of us are here
because a specialized set
35.8 of cells, called germ cells--
38.2 that is the sperm and the egg.
39.853 And I'll make it very
clear why they're called
41.77 germ cells a little bit later.
43.02 It has nothing to
do with infection.
44.62 But it's because a sperm cell
and an egg cell arrived at one
50.29 another, either in vivo-- inside
of our mother-- or in vitro--
54.138 so-called in vitro
fertilization-- and then
55.93 we're implanted into our
mother and became us.
59.59 And so understanding
the process of how
62.8 the egg cell and the
sperm cell came to be
66.13 is really the key
to understanding
67.93 how that fertilization
process came to be.
70.263 Now, I know
everyone's thinking, I
71.68 know how fertilization occurs.
73.202 It occurs through sexual
intercourse and so on.
75.16 And we'll talk a
little bit about that.
77.05 But I promise you
that if you understand
79.75 the menstrual cycle--
81.28 and the menstrual cycle
in today's conversation
83.83 can best be thought of as
a biological cycle that
86.95 occurs in females that allows
the potential for fertilization
90.94 by the sperm, because
that's really what it is,
93.04 and it's a beautifully
orchestrated process
95.08 that I'll describe to you.
96.22 And I should say, all people,
males and females, should
99.79 really understand how the
menstrual cycle works,
101.95 how it impacts
fertilization, but also
105.43 how it impacts the brain and
body, behavior, psychology,
108.46 et cetera.
109.12 And we'll also talk
about spermatogenesis,
112.45 how sperm cells come to
be and how they arrive--
116.74 that is, how they
swim to the egg--
118.45 and the incredible interplay
between the biology
121.81 of the sperm and the
biology of the egg
125.47 leads to this incredible thing
that we call embryogenesis
128.77 and the birth of the
child and, of course,
131.93 the development of that child
into an infant, a toddler,
136.21 an adolescent, a
teen, and an adult.
139.6 Today's discussion,
again, is not just
141.79 for those of you that are
seeking to have children.
144.55 And I say that because
when you look at the data,
148.42 you look at the literature
on longevity and vitality,
151.87 two themes in biology that
oftentimes people lump together
155.55 but aren't always the
same-- for instance,
157.3 there are a lot
of things that we
158.675 can do to increase our
vitality that actually
161.17 can harm our longevity.
163.45 But there are a subset of
biological rules and mechanisms
167.86 that, when aligned,
allow us to maximize both
171.1 our vitality and our longevity.
174.14 And I think it's fair to say
that all of those mechanisms
177.43 and tools are housed
in the discussion
179.65 around maximizing fertility.
181.942 And that's true whether or
not you're male or female.
184.15 In other words, if
you want children
186.22 or if you don't, if you
already have children
188.26 or if you don't, understanding
how fertility and fertilization
192.85 occurs in the
brain and body will
195.67 allow you to maximize your
vitality and longevity.
198.76 And of course,
today's discussion
200.26 will provide an
understanding of the biology
202.63 and many actionable tools that
will also help you conceive
205.42 children, if that's your wish.
206.98 So of course, as is
characteristic of this podcast,
210.02 we will discuss
science-based tools,
212.18 including behavioral tools, both
the dos and the don'ts, and we
215.86 will discuss nutrition-based
tools and supplementation-based
219.25 tools and some other practices,
including things like
222.55 acupuncture, which have quite
good data to support them
226.09 in terms of improving fertility.
227.8 And we will discuss why those
certain practices can work.
231.76 And we will discuss
prescription drugs
233.89 that your doctor can prescribe
to you if, for instance, you
237.82 have a deficit at the
level of hormone production
240.107 or neurotransmitter production
at the level of the brain
242.44 or the pituitary gland--
243.52 I'll explain what all of
those things are soon--
245.74 or the gonads, the ovary and
the testes in females and males
250.03 respectively.
252.08 Again, by the end
of today's episode,
253.64 you will have a lot of knowledge
and actionable tools related
256.39 to maximizing
fertility, and you will
258.85 have a lot of knowledge and
actionable tools related
261.49 to maximizing vitality
and longevity.
264.76 Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize
266.532 that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research
268.99 roles at Stanford.
270.07 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
272.29 to bring zero cost to
consumer information
274.24 about science and
science-related tools
276.1 to the general public.
277.45 In keeping with
that theme, I'd like
278.95 to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.
281.42 Our first sponsor
is Maui Nui Meats.
283.69 Maui Nui Meats, I
can confidently say,
285.82 are the most nutrient-dense and
delicious red meat available.
288.97 Maui Nui he spent
nearly a decade
290.77 building a USDA-certified
wild harvesting system
294.1 to help balance invasive
deer populations
296.29 on the island of Maui.
297.76 The solution they built
turns the proliferation
299.86 of an invasive species
into a wide range
302.14 of nutrient-dense products, from
fresh butcher cuts and organ
305.17 meats to bone broth,
jerky, and even pet treats.
308.22 Their bone broth has
an unmatched 25 grams
310.59 of protein per 100 calories.
312.563 I've talked before
on this podcast
313.98 and I've had several expert
guests come on this podcast
316.5 to talk about the fact
that most people should aim
319.32 to get 1 gram of quality
protein per pound
322.47 of body weight per day
in order to maximize
324.78 their health, tissue repair,
which includes brain tissue
327.45 repair, and, if you're an active
exerciser, to support recovery
331.23 from exercise.
332.82 Maui Nui Meats have an
incredible quality protein
336.09 to calorie ratio.
337.35 And I mentioned the bone broth.
339.13 I should also mention that their
ground meats and their venison
341.82 steaks are absolutely
delicious, and their jerky
344.13 is absolutely terrific.
345.12 In fact, it's the only jerky
that I've eaten consistently
347.7 that I happen to like
consistently over time.

362.4 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
365.13 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress
covers with cooling, heating,
367.83 and sleep tracking capacity.
369.63 I've talked many times
before on this podcast
371.73 about the fact that sleep
is the fundamental layer
374.34 of mental health, physical
health, and performance.
376.57 Now, one of the key things for
getting a great night's sleep
379.07 every single night is to
optimize the temperature
381.48 of your sleeping environment.
382.95 Put simply, in order to fall
asleep and stay deeply asleep,
386.37 your body temperature needs to
drop by about 1 to 3 degrees.
389.34 And waking up, on
the other hand,
391.12 involves a heating of your
body by about 1 to 3 degrees.
394.59 With Eight Sleep, you
can tune the temperature
397.47 of your mattress
cover or mattress
399.51 to be cooler or
hotter, depending on
401.855 whether or not you tend to
run too hot or too cold,
403.98 and you can even vary
it across the night
405.78 so that you can access
the best deep sleep early
408.0 in the night, the so-called
REM sleep, rapid eye movement
410.52 sleep, that's more pronounced
in the later half of the night
413.02 and in doing so really
get your sleep optimized,
415.26 not just in terms of duration
but in terms of quality
417.81 and the overall
architecture of your sleep.
419.85 This has a profound influence
on your alertness, focus, mood,
423.143 and many other important
factors throughout the day.

431.79 Today's episode is also brought
to us by Momentous Supplements.
434.55 I want to acknowledge that not
everybody needs supplements,
437.008 and yet many, many people
derive tremendous benefit
439.47 from proper supplementation.
441.37 I would count myself
in that group.
442.92 There are excellent supplements
for improving the depth
445.59 and quality of sleep,
for improving focus,
448.38 and for improving energy
and for hormone optimization
451.5 and many other factors related
to our mental health, physical
454.23 health, and performance.
455.3 We've partnered with
Momentous Supplements
457.05 for three important reasons.
458.262 First of all,
Momentous supplements
459.72 are of the very highest quality.
461.342 Second of all, they
ship internationally,
463.05 and we know that
many of you reside
464.508 outside of the United States.
465.81 And third, they focus on
single ingredient formulations.
468.67 This is very important.
469.75 There is a place for blends.
471.21 But in most cases, if you're
going to develop a supplement
474.09 protocol, you want it to be
single-ingredient formulations
477.03 so that you can adjust the
dosages of different things
479.28 according to what works and
doesn't work for you, which
481.572 is essentially impossible
to do if you are using
483.63 multi-ingredient formulations.
485.29 If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take
487.29 and that we've discussed here
on the Huberman Lab podcast,
489.707 you can go to livemomentous--

500.52 Let's talk about fertility.
501.78 And in doing so, let's take
a step back from this word
504.12 "fertility" and ask, what is
fertility and fertilization
507.45 really all about?
508.69 Well, the obvious answer is that
it's about producing offspring.
511.77 But more importantly, it's
about producing offspring
514.95 that contain the genetic
components of both parents
518.61 and indeed contain half of
the genes from one parent
521.82 and half of the genes
from another parent.
523.74 Now, there are two general
types of cells in the body.
526.73 The most common types
of cells in the body
528.48 are called somatic cells.
529.57 So these would be all
the cells in your body
531.403 except the egg in females
and the sperm in males.
534.9 The egg in females
and the sperm males
537.33 are part of what's
called the germline.
539.04 And again, it has nothing
to do with infection.
540.998 It's just that the cells of the
germline have genes that cannot
545.34 be modified by the behavior
of the individual that houses
549.3 those genes.
550.2 What do I mean by that?
551.26 Well, if I were to tell you that
by exercising you can improve
554.31 mitochondrial function,
you can change hormones
558.54 by reducing stress,
you can reduce cortisol
560.91 by hitting puberty,
for instance, you
564.36 will have the secretion of
hormones that then change
566.845 gene expression in
other cells, leading
568.47 to the development of
body hair, facial hair,
571.14 deepening the voice,
breast growth, et cetera,
573.925 you'd say, OK, great.
574.8 Yeah, that all
makes perfect sense.
576.91 But that's all occurring in
the so-called somatic cells.
579.6 The germ cells or
the germline cells--
581.91 that is, the egg and the sperm--
583.98 are a very unique
and protected set
586.26 of cells that are generated
in a particular way
589.47 and whose genetic components are
not modifiable by experience.
595.272 And when you take a step
back and you think about it,
597.48 you say, oh, that's right.
598.563 There's no reason to
think that exercising
600.99 will make the children that
you have not yet had stronger.
605.02 And you say, of course not.
606.27 Well, why is that?
607.09 Well, that's because
there is a barrier
609.27 between the genes of the
germline cells and behaviors.
614.01 They cannot be modified by
behaviors and the various
616.62 things that you do
in your lifetime.
618.39 Now, I suppose
there's an exception
619.92 in the negative direction.
621.96 And what I'm referring to
here is if you were to, say,
624.3 be exposed to a chemical
that could mutate the DNA
627.15 of your egg or sperm or if you
were to fertilize an embryo
632.01 in a certain way or at a certain
stage of life that it got
635.07 an extra chromosome,
for instance--
636.528 we'll talk about this
a little bit later--
638.278 well, then, of course,
you could end up
639.96 with offspring
that have modified
642.24 DNA that don't faithfully
represent half of the genes
645.75 from mom and half of
the genes from dad.
648.21 But that's not the same
as specific behaviors
651.39 modifying the genes
of those cells--
653.55 the sperm and the egg cells--
655.32 in a way that improves
the offspring.
658.71 So the key first thing
to understand today
660.613 is that there's a distinction
between somatic cells, which
663.03 is the vast majority
of cells in your body,
664.44 and the so-called
germline cells, which
665.79 are the egg and the sperm.
666.873 The egg and the sperm are these
highly protected populations
669.69 of cells that, in
females, actually come
673.41 to be during embryogenesis.
676.11 So for all females
out there, you
678.84 generate what today I'm going
to refer to as a vault of cells.
682.44 You have a vault of eggs
that are your germline.
686.73 Those eggs all contain all
the chromosomes of your DNA.
692.08 So it's going to
be-- as most of you
693.62 know, there are 23 chromosomes,
and chromosomes exist in pairs.
697.45 So the way to think about this
is each pair is one strand,
700.53 and you have 22
so-called autosomes,
702.66 and then you have
one sex chromosome.
704.4 The sex chromosome will be
either X or Y. So in a female,
707.38 they have two X chromosomes.
708.76 So in each one of the
eggs that a woman has
711.12 and that she's had
since she was an embryo
713.64 and that's contained
in this vault,
715.5 those eggs are, of course, going
to be very immature at birth.
719.52 She hasn't undergone
puberty yet.
720.96 And certainly, as an embryo,
she hasn't undergone puberty.
723.51 And those cells are
going to contain
725.91 23 pairs of chromosomes.
728.81 This is very important--
729.81 23 pairs of chromosomes.
732.1 The chromosomes are
essentially the wrapped-up DNA
736.32 that contains all the
genetic information
738.33 to create any cell
type in the body
740.19 and actually to create an
entirely new individual.
743.41 Now, there are 23 pairs of
chromosomes, 22 of which
746.76 are called autosomes.
748.433 If that doesn't
make sense to you,
749.85 just remember, autosome,
OK, there's 22 of them.
752.32 And then there's one
so-called sex chromosome.
754.5 The sex chromosomes are either
X or Y. But this is a female,
757.99 so she's going to have
23 pairs of chromosomes,
760.5 and she's going to have two
X chromosomes for the sex
764.4 chromosomes.
765.118 If this is already confusing
to you, don't worry,
767.16 I'll make it very clear how
this all relates to fertility
770.13 and how it relates to
chromosomal segregation
773.01 and a bunch of things that I
think maybe you've heard of
775.59 and that perhaps
were opaque to you.
777.945 But I promise to
make them clear.
779.32 But just understand that,
within each of those eggs,
781.487 they have 23 pairs
of chromosomes.
783.57 And for those of you
that like nomenclature,
786.78 I'll tell you that those
cells are considered diploid.
789.42 They're called the
diploid, and that
791.16 means that they have 23
pairs of chromosomes,
794.01 as distinguished
from cells that are
796.89 haploid where there's only one
set of those 23 chromosomes.
802.21 So instead of 23 pairs,
there's only 23 chromosomes.
805.0 We'll come back to haploid
cells a little bit later.
808.51 So when a female is born,
she has all these eggs
812.46 in the reserve, in
this vault, that she'll
814.53 have for her entire life.
815.64 She's not going
to make any more.
817.26 But they are very,
very immature.
819.24 So when a woman is
in embryogenesis,
821.79 she develops these
very immature eggs.
824.932 Today we're also going
to talk about follicles,
826.89 and we will be careful
to distinguish follicles
830.16 from eggs.
830.85 They're often talked about
interchangeably, online
833.43 and elsewhere and even by
fertility docs and OB/GYNs.
836.16 But right now we're just talking
about the egg cells, the eggs
840.33 themselves, which are cells.
842.64 Now, the goal of
fertilization is
845.58 to bring that egg cell
into close enough proximity
848.31 that it can be fertilized
by a single sperm cell.
852.3 And that sperm cell will
bring 23 chromosomes, as well,
856.89 that include--
857.73 just as in the female egg, it'll
have 22 autosomes and one sex
862.38 chromosome.
863.17 And in the male,
that sex chromosome
864.87 can either be an X chromosome,
which then would give rise
868.91 to female offspring, or a
Y chromosome, which would
872.0 give rise to male offspring.
873.92 And today we're not talking
about sexual differentiation.
876.62 That's a topic of a previous
and yet another future episode.
879.44 But just to give you a sense
of how X chromosomes and Y
883.22 chromosomes can
actually accomplish
885.11 that sexual differentiation,
both of body and brain.
889.73 I'll just mention in two
sentences that, for instance,
892.8 if there's a Y chromosome as
opposed to an X chromosome,
895.58 that Y chromosome contains genes
that suppress, for instance,
899.76 the development of
female genitalia
901.88 and thereby give rise
to male genitalia.
905.458 So rather than the
formation of a clitoris,
907.25 it's the formation of a penis.
908.902 And rather than the
formation of ovaries,
910.61 the formation of a testes.
912.14 So that's more directed
towards sexual differentiation.
914.438 We're not going to get
into that right now.
916.23 We'll get into that
in a future episode.
918.05 But even if you're
only tracking about 10%
921.56 of what I'm saying right now,
I promise you're doing great.
924.15 If you're tracking
more than 10%, well,
925.82 then you're doing
terrifically well,
927.32 because the essence of fertility
and fertilization is to bring
930.44 together that haploid cell that
is the sperm that only has 23
937.34 chromosomes-- but not
pairs of chromosomes
940.55 because that's
the DNA from dad--
942.47 together with the egg,
which, as I told you already,
945.95 has 23 pairs of chromosomes.
947.97 So part of the
fertilization process
950.57 has to be to get rid of
one half of those 23 pairs
954.56 in the female.
955.25 You got to get
rid of it, and you
958.36 have to get the egg and
the sperm in proximity
960.82 so that the egg can
potentially be fertilized
963.4 by the sperm bringing
the DNA, the 23
967.24 single strands of
chromosomes from dad,
971.53 into a cell that has 23
single strands from mom.
976.13 So I realize I'm probably being
a little bit repetitive here,
978.79 but I want everyone
to understand this
981.34 because it really frames up
fertility and reproduction
984.55 in the proper way.
986.77 We've got a cell from
mom, the egg, which
989.65 has 23 pairs of chromosomes.
992.87 We need to get rid of
one set of those pairs
995.86 so that there's
only 23 chromosomes.
997.75 We need to get rid of
half of those chromosomes.
1000.3 And then we need to bring
that cell together physically
1003.54 with the sperm cell
that contains the 23
1008.13 chromosomal strands from dad.
1010.562 And we need to bring
those together so that you
1012.52 get 23 chromosomal
pairs from dad
1014.86 and 23 chromosomal
pairs from mom.
1018.01 And in doing so, you
create a cell, which
1022.21 then becomes multiple cells.
1023.62 That's going to be the
developing embryo that
1025.569 has half the genes from mom
and half the genes from dad.
1028.089 So I hope that's clear.
1029.56 That is the biological
logic, which I realize
1032.342 is a bit of a tongue twister.
1033.55 But forgive me.
1034.96 It is the most accurate way
to describe this process.
1037.72 We're trying to bring
together the 23 single strands
1041.589 of chromosomes
from dad and the 23
1043.48 single strands of chromosomes
from mom into the same cell.
1047.95 Now, that requires a
literal physical contact
1051.85 and pairing of the two cells.
1053.38 But as I mentioned before,
all these eggs in mom
1057.76 are sitting in a vault, and
they're very, very immature.
1060.58 So the ovulatory cycle
and the menstrual cycle
1064.45 are really about
first eliminating
1067.06 half of the chromosomal pairs
in that 23 sets of chromosomes
1071.86 and not getting rid of,
for instance, half--
1074.71 just going 1 to 11 or 12 to 23.
1079.42 That's not the goal.
1080.39 The goal is to have
chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
1082.84 6, all the way up to
23, but only to have
1085.6 half of the chromosomes there
and to bring that cell together
1089.23 with the sperm cell,
physically, then allow
1091.99 them to fuse and allow
the chromosomes from dad
1094.99 and the chromosomes from mom
to fuse within a single cell
1098.38 and duplicate into cells that
contain half of the chromosomes
1102.07 from dad and half of the
chromosomes from mom.
1104.29 That's what the ovulatory
and menstrual cycle
1106.42 are really all about.
1107.752 So when thinking
about it that way,
1109.21 I'd like to just initiate the
discussion by focusing first
1112.09 on the female component,
or the egg component,
1115.78 of fertility and fertilization.
1119.65 As I mentioned before, a
female has all the eggs,
1123.31 albeit very immature eggs, that
she's going to have at the time
1126.82 that she's born.
1128.32 Now, puberty will
happen at some point
1132.34 and will allow the ovulatory
and the menstrual cycle
1135.7 to commence.
1137.095 Now, one question that
you perhaps are asking
1138.97 is, what controls
the onset of puberty?
1141.1 And there are a number
of different results,
1144.053 each of which could
be an entire episode
1145.72 of a podcast on its own.
1147.04 But I'll just
highlight a few things
1148.54 that we know about the onset
of menses or menstruation,
1152.77 or it's sometimes also
called a menarche.
1154.942 One thing that you'll notice
about today's discussion
1157.15 is that if you were to take
any number of your notes
1159.46 online and put them
into a search function
1162.28 that you would see a lot
of different language used
1164.68 for the same thing.
1165.65 So for instance,
some people will
1166.45 talk about the egg and the
follicle as the same thing,
1168.73 even though they are not.
1169.96 I'll explain the
difference soon.
1171.335 Some people will talk about
menses or menstruation
1173.5 or menarche as the
exact same thing.
1175.19 And in fact, they are
not the exact same thing,
1177.22 but oftentimes these words
are used interchangeably.
1180.34 I'll do my best today to not
overload you with nomenclature
1183.22 but rather to use the
most commonly used terms
1186.97 for the different aspects of
fertility and fertilization.
1189.94 But when it comes to
the onset of puberty,
1192.7 first of all, most
of you have probably
1195.01 heard that the
onset of puberty is
1198.64 happening much
earlier in females now
1200.89 than it was some years ago.
1202.31 And in fact, that is the case.
1204.13 And I'll talk about
some statistics related
1206.05 to this which are
pretty striking
1208.06 but don't necessarily point
to anything detrimental.
1211.74 It doesn't necessarily mean
that something bad is happening.
1214.24 What do we know for sure?
1215.38 Well, we know that
there are a number
1217.75 of signals that come
both through the brain
1220.3 and through the body--
1222.37 and more likely both-- in order
to control the onset of puberty
1225.34 in females.
1226.27 A couple of examples-- the
first is a mechanistic one.
1229.3 We know, for instance,
that the entire process
1233.35 of the ovulatory menstrual cycle
is initiated from the brain.
1236.398 We're going to get
into this in a lot
1237.94 more detail in a few minutes.
1239.148 But there's a certain number of
hormones and neurotransmitters
1242.86 that are communicated
from the brain,
1245.2 a structure called
the hypothalamus,
1247.01 which roughly sits above
the roof of your mouth,
1249.7 and that communicates
with a gland, an endocrine
1253.24 or hormone-releasing gland
called the pituitary gland.
1256.85 The pituitary gland looks
like a stalk that essentially
1261.58 extends out of the brain.
1263.06 It's also located not far
from the roof of your mouth.
1266.14 And that has two
sort of small marble
1268.9 or grape-sized protrusions,
the anterior pituitary
1273.863 and the posterior pituitary.
1275.03 And they release different
hormones into the bloodstream.
1278.29 Puberty is in part
controlled by the fact
1281.59 that, up until
puberty, there are
1284.56 neurons in the
hypothalamus that release
1286.54 a neurotransmitter called
GABA, which is inhibitory,
1288.97 and that prevents the
neurons in the hypothalamus
1292.15 from releasing a very
important hormone called
1296.35 gonadotropin-releasing
hormone, or GnRH.
1299.42 So the first thing I'd
really like everyone
1301.24 to know and commit to
memory today is very easy--
1303.49 GnRH stands for
gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
1306.95 This comes from
the brain and will
1308.89 communicate to the pituitary
to release certain hormones.
1312.37 Prior to puberty, in
both males and females,
1316.33 there are neurons in the brain
that are actively suppressing
1319.54 the neurons that release GnRH.
1321.49 It's like no puberty,
no puberty, no puberty.
1323.925 You can't have puberty.
1324.942 You can't have puberty.
1325.9 And in fact, those cells are
releasing this neurotransmitter
1329.85 called GABA because
it's inhibitory.
1331.35 It prevents the firing
of those neurons.
1333.8 So puberty is
actively suppressed up
1335.95 until a certain point.
1337.06 It's also actively suppressed,
at least in some species and we
1340.21 think at least partially in
humans, by the tonic release--
1344.35 that means the ongoing
release, around the clock--
1347.05 of a hormone called melatonin.
1349.48 Later in life-- in
fact, after puberty--
1352.54 melatonin will be secreted only
in the dark phase of each night
1357.1 and around the time
that one goes to sleep.
1359.27 But in children
and in particular
1361.96 in children prior to
puberty, melatonin
1364.0 is released more
or less constantly.
1366.67 Now, melatonin isn't
the only source
1368.737 of suppression of puberty.
1369.82 It's also these neural
mechanisms involving GABA.
1373.15 But it is certainly a
great candidate for one
1376.39 of the reasons why
puberty doesn't generally
1378.4 tend to happen at,
say, age four age five.
1380.53 That would be very unusual.
1383.74 Another component of
suppression of puberty
1387.49 is that typically in children
they have relatively low body
1391.09 fat stores.
1391.85 Why is this important?
1392.81 Well, we know that one of
the things that can trigger
1395.86 the onset of puberty-- in
particular in females--
1398.77 is that when enough
body fat accumulates,
1402.25 that body fat releases
a hormone called leptin,
1405.64 and that hormone leptin
travels in the bloodstream,
1408.55 across the blood-brain barrier,
and goes to the hypothalamus
1411.31 and can trigger the
onset of puberty
1412.99 by activating the
neurons that release
1415.99 gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
1417.71 So many people believe that
one of the reasons that puberty
1421.21 is happening earlier
and earlier in females
1423.82 is because of the accumulation
of more body fat at younger
1428.05 ages than was observed 30 or
40 and certainly 100 years ago.
1432.79 Now, I can already imagine a
number of people are thinking,
1435.7 oh, this must relate
to the obesity crisis.
1438.05 And indeed, there is
a crisis of obesity.
1439.81 Obesity is something that is
causing all sorts of problems
1444.94 with people's health at
various levels, brain and body,
1447.94 and that is far
more frequent today
1449.74 than it was even 20 years ago.
1451.76 So it is indeed a
crisis because it
1453.55 has enormous detrimental
effects for so many aspects
1456.79 of brain and body
health and longevity.
1460.27 But this whole process of
thinking about body fat
1462.807 signaling leptin to the
hypothalamus and the onset
1464.89 of puberty doesn't
necessarily have
1467.24 to do with the obesity crisis.
1468.49 It might relate, but it could
also relate to, for instance,
1471.52 improved nutrition,
which is allowing body
1473.83 fat stores to accumulate maybe
not to the level of obesity
1476.89 but to accumulate earlier
and at younger ages
1480.1 in females, which
is then causing
1482.23 earlier puberty in females.
1484.39 To just highlight how
that might be possible,
1486.67 I want to review some data that
talk about the onset of menses,
1490.63 menstruation--
that is, puberty--
1492.67 in females according to
country and according
1495.7 to age over the last
100 or more years.
1499.01 So what are the
general trends in terms
1500.752 of the onset of
puberty in females?
1502.21 Well, that's an
easy one to answer.
1504.94 Over the last 100 years or
so, the onset of puberty
1509.32 has been occurring much earlier
with each passing decade.
1513.88 It's really an incredible
set of statistics.
1517.21 I will provide a
link to these data
1518.71 since I know a number of
you are listening and not
1520.793 just watching on YouTube.
1522.62 This is from a study in
which the onset of puberty
1525.46 has been analyzed from
as early as the 1850s--
1529.27 in certain countries,
there are data on that--
1531.52 out to the 1970s and
in other countries
1533.47 starting at about 1900,
extending out to about 1990.
1537.55 These are ongoing
collections of data.
1539.98 But just to give you a sense
of how the data are falling out
1542.932 in a couple of
different countries,
1544.39 just to give you a flavor--
1546.1 but for those of you listening
and for those of you watching,
1550.21 the essence of all
of these findings
1552.43 is that puberty is
happening much, much earlier
1554.89 with each passing decade.
1556.15 So for instance, in the United
States, around 1900 or 1903,
1562.28 the average age of menarche,
the onset of puberty, in females
1566.14 was about 14 years old, whereas
in 1990, the average age is 11.
1571.84 So that's a pretty
significant, we can say,
1575.08 acceleration of the
onset of puberty.
1577.61 Now, of course,
these are averages.
1579.08 So there will be exceptions.
1580.55 There's a distribution of data.
1582.55 Today, still, there will
be young females who
1585.22 will undergo puberty at age
11 or 10 or maybe even 9
1588.28 and others who will undergo
puberty at age 13, 14, maybe
1591.67 even 16 or 17.
1593.44 However, if we look
at, for instance,
1596.06 the data from Norway, which
dates back quite far-- they
1598.57 have excellent record-keeping--
to 1850, what we see
1602.14 is that the average age of the
onset of female puberty in 1850
1606.73 in Norway was 17 years
old, whereas in 1970, it's
1612.33 13 years old.
1613.69 So this is a
dramatic acceleration
1616.11 of the onset of puberty.
1617.357 And you see a similar trend
in other countries, as well.
1619.69 So if we were to look,
for instance, in the UK,
1623.07 they have a smaller data
set, meaning it only
1625.68 extends back to about 1940.
1627.81 But the average age of the onset
of puberty in the UK in 1940
1631.98 was 13 and 1/2 years old.
1633.69 Again, this is just for females.
1635.52 And in 1970, it
was closer to 13,
1638.46 with a trend towards
declining even further.
1640.542 Unfortunately, they
didn't continue
1642.0 to collect data out to 2022.
1644.76 And as a final point, if we
were to look at, for instance,
1647.71 in Germany and Finland,
the average onset
1651.06 of puberty in 1870 was
16 and 1/2 years old.
1654.9 By 1940, it was down to
13 and 1/2 years old.
1658.24 So all of these data have
borne out over and over again,
1662.31 regardless of location in the
world, which is important,
1664.68 because when you start to
think about the obesity crisis,
1666.54 you can say, well, that's
mainly in developed countries,
1668.91 believe it or not-- or
perhaps not surprisingly.
1671.13 And maybe it has to do
with the obesity crisis.
1673.57 And yet I don't think we
can conclude that at all.
1676.2 Something is happening, however.
1678.33 It could be increased
body fat stores
1681.18 due to overeating and obesity.
1682.75 However, it could also
be-- unrelated to obesity,
1685.41 it could be, for
instance, improved
1687.81 nutrition and the availability
of quality nutrition, which
1691.53 can signal the
maturation of the brain
1693.96 and body mechanisms that
trigger the onset of puberty,
1696.96 ovulatory cycle,
and menstruation.
1698.82 So we want to be very careful
about leaping to conclusions
1701.37 about what these trends mean,
but the trends themselves
1704.04 are very, very apparent.
1705.63 And as a final
point, I should also
1707.43 mention that there are a
number of different behavioral
1709.98 and psychosocial, as they're
called, interactions that
1712.92 can influence puberty as well.
1714.64 This has been most strikingly
observed in animals.
1717.61 And so I don't want
anyone to be alarmed
1719.37 or to leap to any great
conclusions about the onset
1722.31 of timing of puberty in
humans, but I'd be remiss
1724.798 if I didn't tell you about
a certain result which
1726.84 shows that if a young female
is exposed to the odor--
1732.63 not necessarily the pheromones.
1734.16 There's a distinction between
odors that we perceive
1736.77 and pheromones, which
are subconscious.
1739.82 We don't actively perceive, but
that can impact our biology,
1743.207 and pheromones effects in
humans are very controversial.
1745.54 But we know, for instance, that
if you take a female animal--
1748.56 and there's some
evidence from humans
1750.63 that if you take a
young prepubertal female
1753.6 and you expose her to the scent
of a reproductively-competent
1759.45 male for a series of days,
but maybe even as short
1765.3 as a few hours,
and she is also not
1769.02 regularly being exposed to
the scent of her father,
1772.59 that she can undergo
puberty earlier.
1774.9 That's right.
1775.74 There is something
about the odor
1777.72 and/or pheromones, or
perhaps something else, that
1782.46 occurs when a young prepubertal
female has a father that she's
1787.73 in regular contact with.
1788.73 He wouldn't necessarily have
to live at home but that
1790.938 is around a lot that
his smell is registered
1794.46 by her biological systems.
1796.71 That-- I don't want
to say protects
1798.99 because it kind of skews the
valence of the conversation,
1802.14 but that offsets or buffers
the otherwise observed effect,
1808.39 which is that the scent of a
reproductively-competent male,
1811.86 if it's present often enough
or perhaps intensely enough,
1814.92 that it can trigger the onset
of puberty in that female.
1817.44 In other words, the scent of
a male that is not the father
1822.09 and we think also that is not
biologically related to her
1825.12 can trigger earlier
onset of puberty.
1827.85 And that effect can at
least be partially buffered
1832.35 by her being in the
presence of the scent
1836.04 from her biological father.
1837.99 Now, some of you are
probably already leaping
1840.0 to conclusions about
what this means.
1841.542 Should you not
allow your daughter
1843.593 to be exposed to
any males who are
1845.01 of reproductive age, et cetera?
1847.05 That's certainly
not what I'm saying.
1848.635 There's a huge number
of considerations
1850.26 that go into that
calculation for everybody
1852.78 and circumstances, et cetera.
1854.52 But the point is that the odors
of individuals, both related--
1860.97 in particular, closely related--
and non-related individuals,
1865.41 can shape the neural systems
and the hormone systems that
1870.597 can trigger the onset
of puberty or suppress
1872.43 the onset of puberty.
1873.54 So whether or not we're
talking about onset
1875.37 of puberty at this
age or that age
1877.05 and whether or not
biologically-related male
1880.14 or non-biologically-related
male scents around,
1882.24 et cetera, the thing I
want everyone to know
1885.09 is that at some point
during development,
1887.85 typically nowadays between
the ages of 11 and 15
1892.77 or so-- again, there's
variability there.
1896.55 The suppression of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone
1899.49 released from the
hypothalamus is removed,
1901.77 and then
gonadotropin-releasing hormone
1904.47 can activate cells
within the pituitary.
1907.11 And if you really
want to know, it's
1908.61 the anterior pituitary
in particular.
1910.77 And then the anterior
pituitary gland,
1913.3 which sits at and kind of
bridges the brain and the body
1917.25 because it allows the release of
hormones into the bloodstream,
1921.27 that anterior pituitary
is going to release
1923.52 two key hormones that everyone
should know the name of
1926.52 and what they do.
1927.46 And when I say everyone,
I mean males and females
1929.55 need to know about
these hormones
1931.2 because they have an active
role in both males and females.
1934.09 And of course, you
should want to know
1936.33 and should know about
the biology of everyone
1939.15 on the planet, in my
opinion, because it tells you
1941.773 a lot more about
humans than if you just
1943.44 focus on your own biology.
1944.82 But those two
hormones are called
1946.83 luteinizing hormone,
which is abbreviated LH,
1951.12 and follicle-stimulating
hormone, which
1954.03 is abbreviated FSH.
1955.89 So the simple picture that
you need to have in your mind
1958.83 is gonadotropin-releasing
hormone from the brain,
1961.23 from the hypothalamus
in particular,
1963.45 is causing the
release of luteinizing
1966.09 hormone and follicle-stimulating
hormone, GnRH stimulates
1970.92 LH, luteinizing hormone, and
follicle-stimulating hormone,
1973.89 FSH.
1975.09 LH and FSH travel in the blood
and can access all the cells
1979.38 and tissues of the body.
1980.38 This is one of the incredible
things about hormones is that
1984.33 many hormones-- and LH and FSH
are included in this group--
1988.83 can travel into cells,
and they can actually
1992.55 change the genetic
expression of those cells.
1995.04 They can change which
genes are turned on
1996.9 and which genes are turned off.
1998.192 And they can also attach to
the surface of those cells
2001.367 and make those cells take
on different properties.
2003.45 So they can mature those cells.
2004.742 So for instance, a good
example of this outside
2007.31 of the context we've
been talking about
2008.99 is the hormone testosterone
can travel to the hair follicle
2012.365 and can stimulate changes in the
genes of the cells of the hair
2014.99 follicle that can
make hair grow.
2017.12 A different hormone,
estrogen, can
2019.19 travel to the cells
of the breast tissue
2021.8 and activate genes that control
enlargement of the cells
2024.29 of the breast tissue.
2025.28 Prolactin, a different hormone,
can travel to the mammary ducts
2028.52 and control the production
and the secretion of milk.
2032.09 And in males, that can actually
happen, in certain cases,
2035.55 although it's rare.
2036.53 But prolactin can also
travel to areas of the brain
2039.11 that control libido,
for instance.
2041.09 And just so you'll
never forget it,
2043.34 males' elevated
levels of prolactin
2045.44 are actually what set
the refractory period
2047.54 after ejaculation
and prevent erection
2049.639 for some period of time.
2050.94 So you'll never
forget prolactin.
2053.96 The point being that
different hormones
2056.09 have different effects
on different cells,
2057.889 depending on what
cells those are.
2059.366 Estrogen or estradiol is going
to have different effects
2061.699 on the breast tissue
than it would on skin,
2064.37 although as effects on both.
2065.84 Similarly, when LH and
FSH, luteinizing hormone
2069.71 and follicle-stimulating
hormone, travel in the blood
2072.83 to the gonad and the
gonad is an ovary,
2076.82 it will have a certain
set of consequences.
2079.86 And when luteinizing hormone
and follicle-stimulating hormone
2082.48 travel in the blood to
a gonad and that gonad
2084.909 happens to be a teste, then
it will have a different set
2087.82 of biological implications.
2089.69 So let's focus now
on what happens when
2092.08 LH and FSH arrive at the ovary.
2094.989 And let's assume now that we're
talking about a female who
2099.19 has already undergone
puberty, or perhaps we
2102.88 could even frame this in
the context of a female who
2105.46 is about to undergo puberty.
2107.77 FSH and LH are now able to
be released because she's
2110.65 undergoing puberty.
2112.12 But the same set of
processes, essentially,
2114.82 would occur for any point from
puberty onward until menopause,
2119.51 which is the depletion of that
vault, that ovarian reserve
2124.18 of all those immature eggs.
2125.68 I'd like to take a brief
break and acknowledge
2127.75 our sponsor, Athletic Greens.
2129.79 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
vitamin mineral probiotic
2132.97 drink that also contains
digestive enzymes
2135.34 and adaptogens.
2136.42 I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012,
2139.6 so that's 10 years
now of taking Athletic
2141.55 Greens every single day.
2142.91 So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring this podcast.
2145.223 The reason I started taking
Athletic Greens and the reason
2147.64 I still take Athletic
Greens is that it
2149.62 covers all of my foundational
nutritional needs.
2152.205 So whether or not
I'm eating well
2153.58 or enough or not, I'm sure that
I'm covering all of my needs
2156.61 for vitamins,
minerals, probiotics,
2158.53 adaptogens to combat stress,
and the digestive enzymes really
2162.1 help my digestion.
2163.12 I just feel much better when
I'm drinking Athletic Greens.
2165.598 If you'd like to
try Athletic Greens,

the month of January of 10 free
2190.87 travel packs plus a year
supply of vitamin D3/K2.
2194.38 OK, so we're now going
to talk about ovulation
2196.36 and menstruation, and
let's just remember
2198.068 what this is all about.
2199.1 This is all about creating
the potential for an egg
2202.39 to be fertilized,
and that egg needs
2204.22 to have half of the
chromosomal pairs, so no pairs,
2208.18 but it's got to have 23
chromosomes just from mom.
2211.12 And we need to
position that egg so
2213.82 that the egg can
be met by the sperm
2216.82 and that sperm can
penetrate that egg
2219.01 and donate its 23 individual
strands of chromosomes
2224.2 to that egg so that you can
bring together the DNA of dad
2227.95 and the DNA of mom.
2229.3 So the obligatory
menstrual cycle
2231.46 occurs when luteinizing hormone
and follicle-stimulating
2236.08 hormone have been released.
2238.12 And the
ovulatory/menstrual cycle--
2241.81 and here I have to kind of
pick what I want to call it.
2244.683 I guess to be really accurate,
we would just call it
2246.85 the female reproductive cycle,
but that includes underneath it
2250.545 both the menstrual cycle,
as it's sometimes called,
2252.67 and the ovulatory cycle.
2254.0 So you decide.
2254.95 I'm going to interchangeably
discuss the ovulatory cycle
2258.25 and the menstrual cycle.
2259.47 The problem is, when
you say menstruation,
2261.22 people often think about
just the period, the shedding
2263.59 of the uterine lining when
fertilization has not occurred.
2266.63 So if I start saying
ovulatory cycle,
2269.35 just keep in mind I'm
referring to the entire thing.
2272.57 Now, this is probably
also a good opportunity
2274.78 to say that if you heard that
the ovulatory/menstrual cycle
2279.37 is 28 days long, that's
true in some cases,
2282.85 but that's not always true.
2284.42 It's, on average, 28 days long.
2287.2 There are some females for which
the ovulatory cycle will be
2291.49 shorter-- it can be
as short as 21 days--
2293.68 and other females for which
it will be 35 days long.
2298.48 Shorter than 21 days
and longer than 35
2300.85 days is rare, although
it does occur.
2303.465 One of the key things when
thinking about fertility
2305.59 is if you talk to OB/GYNs who
are focused on fertility, which
2308.8 I have in anticipation
of this episode,
2310.72 they'll tell you
that whether or not
2313.03 your cycle is 21 days
long or 35 days long
2316.9 is not as much of an issue
necessarily unless it's
2320.53 happening to become much
shorter or much longer
2324.1 in a kind of erratic way.
2325.88 So if you're somebody
who's consistently
2327.64 had 23 day long cycles
and all of a sudden
2330.19 you're having 30 day long
cycles, that's not necessarily
2333.01 an indication of anything bad.
2334.39 But if it's 21 days one month
and it's 30 days the next month
2338.33 and it's 17 days the next
month or even if it's always
2341.95 falling within that 21
to 35 day long cycle
2345.1 but it's very variable from
each month or every other month
2348.04 or so, you probably want
to talk to your OB/GYN
2351.605 because that could indicate
a number of different things.
2353.98 Which things could it indicate?
2355.3 Well, that will become
clear as I spell out
2357.25 the biology in a
bit more detail.
2359.35 But this idea that the
menstrual cycle/ovulatory cycle
2362.35 is always 28 days,
that's just false.
2364.33 That's just not true.
2365.89 I should also mention that there
is a common misconception that
2369.58 because the average menstrual
cycle is 28 days-- indeed,
2372.67 the average is 28 days--
2374.14 and the lunar cycle is 28 days--
2376.607 and of course, there
is a real biology
2378.19 to support the
fact that the lunar
2379.607 cycle can't, in fact,
impact certain aspects
2382.14 of human behavior.
2383.62 It does, and we'll
talk about lunar cycles
2385.56 in a future episode.
2386.82 But there is zero data
to support the idea
2390.18 that the menstrual cycle
and the lunar cycle
2393.03 are linked in any
kind of causal way.
2396.12 Sorry to break it to you.
2397.5 The lunar cycle and the
tidal cycles at the ocean
2401.407 are definitely linked in ways
that are super interesting
2403.74 related to the tilt of the
Earth and the pull of gravity
2405.72 of different planets, and
it's an incredible story
2407.94 into itself.
2409.02 But the lunar cycle and
the menstrual cycle,
2411.3 despite having some weak
correlation in terms
2413.85 of their duration or their
so-called periodicity--
2418.41 no pun intended--
2420.21 well, there's no causal
relationship whatsoever
2422.88 between the lunar cycle
and the menstrual cycle.
2425.5 If any of you are
aware of any real data
2428.88 that conflicts with
what I just said,
2430.62 please put that in the
comment section on YouTube.
2433.44 But this is pretty well
established as far as I know.
2436.44 OK, so we need to bring together
the so-called haploid contents,
2442.11 the 23 individual strands
of chromosomes from the egg,
2445.62 to a place and a position
where it could potentially
2448.26 be fertilized by the male.
2449.44 So what happens?
2450.57 Luteinizing hormone and
follicle-stimulating hormone
2452.85 travel to the ovary.
2454.587 These hormones are able
to access the ovary.
2456.42 There's a lot of blood
supply to the ovary.
2458.91 And FSH and LH
arrive at the ovary.
2463.69 The ovary has this vault,
this ovarian reserve
2466.68 of immature cells.
2467.685 They reside within what
are called follicles.
2469.56 The follicles are little
spherical packages
2472.65 that can potentially provide a
nice environment for those eggs
2476.58 to mature.
2477.78 And when FSH, in particular,
arrives at the ovary,
2483.33 a small number of
those follicles
2485.88 will split off from the reserve,
they will exit the vault,
2490.54 and they will
undergo maturation.
2492.9 And the key player here is
follicle-stimulating hormone.
2497.49 And the first 14 days of the
menstrual/ovulatory cycle
2501.75 is referred to as the
follicular phase because
2504.84 of this relationship between
FSH triggering the maturation
2507.72 of a subset of follicles.
2509.82 Now, typically in the
context of a 28 day or so
2513.72 ovulatory/menstrual
cycle, day one
2515.91 is designated as the
first day of the period,
2518.34 of the shedding of
the uterine lining
2520.53 from the previous ovulatory
menstrual cycle in which
2524.76 fertilization did not occur.
2527.17 So day one is when
the period initiates.
2530.91 It is days 1 through
14, approximately--
2533.532 because here we're
just considering
2534.99 the average of a 28-day
cycle, but it could be longer.
2537.1 It could be shorter.
2537.933 But the first half of that cycle
is the so-called follicular
2541.23 phase, FSH, has
triggered the departure
2544.47 of a subset of these follicles
that contain immature eggs.
2547.71 And it is triggering the
maturation of those eggs.
2550.68 Luteinizing hormone is
also present, but also
2553.98 at relatively low levels.
2555.433 And it's during the first half
of this ovulatory menstrual
2557.85 cycle that the main goal is to
get those follicles to mature.
2561.48 So inside of those follicles,
the egg is developing.
2564.72 It's growing.
2565.65 It's maturing.
2567.36 And in doing so, it's also
making its own hormones.
2571.3 This, I think, is one of
the most elegant aspects
2574.02 of the ovulatory menstrual
cycle that, in a few minutes,
2577.102 you'll learn about something
which still to this day,
2579.31 even though I've known about
this stuff for decades now
2581.61 because of my training, still
just blows my mind that you
2585.21 have one hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone,
2587.88 triggering the
maturation of some eggs
2590.42 inside of some follicles and
then those follicles themselves
2592.92 making another hormone
that furthers the process
2597.18 and then soon, as you'll learn,
create a hormone to trigger
2601.468 the second half of the process.
2602.76 Just a beautiful symphony of
expression of different genes
2606.66 and different hormones
to make everything
2608.55 work as optimally as possible.
2610.17 So as these different
follicles mature, somehow--
2613.86 and we still don't
know exactly how--
2615.96 one of those follicles
containing an egg
2618.9 gets selected.
2620.79 It's either because
it matures the fastest
2622.95 or there's something
about it that
2625.92 is still not
completely understood
2628.35 that allows it to be selected.
2630.42 And all the other
follicles that are maturing
2633.33 degenerate and die.
2634.86 And they're gone.
2635.61 They don't go back into
the ovarian reserve.
2637.95 They are now depleted
from that bank account
2641.19 that is the ovarian reserve.
2643.23 They die off.
2644.7 But that single egg
that, keep in mind,
2648.42 contains 23 pairs
of chromosomes--
2651.63 we haven't gotten rid
of one half of those 23
2655.14 sets of chromosomes yet.
2656.73 But that one will
continue to mature.
2658.8 And then, at some
point, that egg
2663.15 will start to undergo a process
in which those chromosomes are
2668.04 pulled apart by
little components
2671.4 within the egg called spindles.
2673.53 They literally have
a physical pulling
2675.48 of the chromosomes apart.
2676.57 So now those 23 pairs are no
longer attached to one another
2680.26 at the middle like
they were before,
2681.76 like two beads of strings--
2684.28 or I should say,
23 short strands
2687.52 of beads that were at once
connected to one another
2691.6 now are pulled apart
so that you have
2693.34 23 chromosomes on
each side, but they're
2696.4 pulled apart from one another.
2698.9 So that diploid
cell is now starting
2702.76 to become a cell in which
half of the chromosomes,
2705.86 half of those 23
pairs, are physically
2708.61 pulled away from the others.
2710.11 And then the egg actually
starts to form its own
2713.5 what we call an
involution of membrane
2715.12 around those 23 pairs, one set
of them, and encapsulates them.
2720.49 So you sort of got
an egg with two parts
2722.65 where the two sets
of chromosomes,
2724.237 two sets of 23 chromosomes,
are now separate
2726.07 from one another
inside of the egg.
2728.17 And then one of those actually
gets ejected from the egg,
2732.01 and the name of that
thing that gets ejected--
2734.35 it's sort of like a little
Hubble pod is how I imagine it,
2737.29 you know, from Star Wars or from
any kind of Space Odyssey movie
2741.22 where some thing
is ready to happen.
2743.11 A little Hubble pod
shoots out of the ship.
2745.06 Well, that 23 pairs is
now ejected from the egg.
2749.71 It's called the polar body.
2750.88 And that's going to degenerate.
2752.41 It's going to go away.
2753.67 And in doing so, take the
egg cell, which was once
2756.73 diploid-- it had 23 pairs
of chromosomes-- and making
2759.67 it haploid.
2761.02 And now what you've got,
in ideal circumstances,
2764.23 is a beautifully pristine
egg that was selected for
2767.5 and has 23 single strands
of chromosomes, 22 autosomes
2771.702 and one sex chromosome.
2772.66 And that sex chromosome is
going to be an X chromosome
2775.45 almost with certainty,
because female--
2779.29 mother-- is creating that egg.
2782.54 So then the egg that contains
just the appropriate 23
2786.64 single-stranded
chromosomes is going
2789.25 to fuse with the wall of
the ovary, and that egg
2791.53 will be released and will
travel into the Fallopian tube.
2796.0 Now, we'll get back to
that egg in a few moments.
2798.29 But that process, which
represents the first half
2800.65 of the ovulatory
menstrual cycle, again,
2802.45 was triggered by FSH and to
some extent luteinizing hormone.
2805.88 But it is the ongoing maturation
of that egg which also causes
2811.48 the production of estrogen,
which allows that whole process
2815.51 to occur.
2816.01 And you could say, why?
2817.22 Well, the answer to the
why is a very important
2819.767 biological principle
that we are going
2821.35 to return to in a number of
different contexts today,
2823.558 both as reference to
female and male fertility.
2828.04 And the principle is a
so-called negative feedback.
2832.55 So when estrogen is present
at relatively low levels
2835.72 in females in the
ovary, as it is
2839.08 during the development of these
eggs, some of that estrogen,
2842.47 of course, is going
to exit the ovary.
2844.857 It's going to go
into the bloodstream.
2846.44 And it's going to travel
back to the pituitary.
2849.81 Now, the pituitary
can release things
2852.078 like follicle-stimulating
hormone and luteinizing
2854.12 hormone.
2854.72 But the way I'd
like you to think
2856.4 about the pituitary for
sake of feedback loops
2858.86 is that it's sort of
like a thermometer
2861.02 that you would put into a pool,
like a backyard pool, that
2864.89 is attached to the heater.
2866.39 And for instance, if you were
to put a thermometer into a pool
2870.38 that you would like
to keep at 70 degrees
2872.9 and the temperature of
that pool is 60 degrees,
2875.6 well, then that
thermometer ought
2877.34 to trigger some
sort of mechanism
2879.56 where the pool would heat
up until the temperature
2881.93 of the pool hit 70
degrees, and then it
2884.12 should trigger that thermometer
to turn off the heating system.
2886.903 That's kind of a
negative feedback
2888.32 system that would keep
the temperature more
2890.112 or less correct.
2891.65 That's a lot of the way that
the system's related to estrogen
2894.78 and also testosterone and
these different things
2896.78 like luteinizing hormone and
follicle-stimulating hormone
2899.155 work as well.
2900.02 Typically, when the level
of a hormone is too high,
2904.35 then it shuts down
the production
2906.02 of the hormones that would
trigger further production
2908.3 of that hormone.
2908.84 I know that's a mouthful.
2909.68 It's a lot to think about.
2910.74 And some of you are
probably thinking, whoa,
2911.82 I'm getting dizzy
now with biology.
2913.46 But I promise you, you
can understand this.
2915.35 In females, when estrogen
is relatively low--
2918.36 but not zero but
is relatively low
2920.06 during that first follicular
half of the ovulatory cycle--
2923.84 it actually triggers negative
feedback on LH and FSH
2927.26 so that not too
much is produced.
2929.06 But then just
prior to ovulation,
2931.61 the levels of estrogen and the
levels of some other hormones
2934.79 from those eggs--
2936.68 you have the eggs producing
estrogen themselves--
2939.35 gets high enough
that it actually
2941.18 triggers a positive feedback
loop on the pituitary.
2944.79 So the pituitary is
essentially observing
2947.72 the amount of estrogen in
the bloodstream produced
2949.82 by the ovary, and the
amount of estrogen
2951.65 towards the end of the second
half of the menstrual cycle
2954.35 has increased and triggers
a positive feedback loop.
2958.16 It triggers the pituitary
to release more FSH and LH,
2962.18 and that helps trigger
ovulation, that deployment
2966.89 or the release of that
one mature proper selected
2969.92 egg that's haploid with the 23
individual pairs of chromosomes
2973.46 into the Fallopian tube.
2975.665 So let's just back up
really quickly and just
2977.54 kind of summarize
what's happened.
2978.957 Gonadotropin-releasing
hormone from the hypothalamus
2981.493 triggers the release of
follicle-stimulating hormone
2983.66 and luteinizing hormone.
2984.8 That travels to the
ovary-- triggers
2986.72 the release of a subset
of immature follicles
2990.26 with immature eggs.
2991.85 Those immature follicles
and immature eggs
2995.03 start to mature,
start to grow because
2998.18 of the presence of
follicle-stimulating hormone.
3000.61 The growth of those eggs
themselves increases estrogen.
3004.36 As the estrogen starts to
accumulate in the environment,
3006.92 some of that travels
back to the pituitary.
3009.22 And when levels of estrogen
arriving at the pituitary
3012.67 are relatively
low, the pituitary
3015.393 says, oh, we don't
need to release
3016.81 any more follicle-stimulating
and luteinizing hormone.
3019.21 However, at some point
just prior to ovulation,
3021.64 enough estrogen has been
produced by that one
3024.28 single selected
mature egg and some
3026.56 of the other follicles around
it that were maturing but then
3029.74 since died off that the estrogen
triggers a positive feedback
3033.86 loop.
3034.36 The pituitary says,
OK, and releases
3037.15 more follicle-stimulating
hormone
3038.68 and luteinizing hormone.
3039.79 And bam, the egg, which has
the proper genetic components,
3044.5 sets off out of the ovary
and into the Fallopian tube.
3048.31 So-called ovulation has begun.
3051.79 That itself, what
I just described,
3053.71 constitutes the first half of
the ovulatory/menstrual cycle,
3056.902 which we call the
follicular phase.
3058.36 And it's marked by the presence
of FSH and some other things,
3061.36 but we can really think
about it as marked by FSH
3064.3 from the pituitary and by
estrogen, or estradiol, made
3068.86 within the ovary.
3070.28 Then comes the second half of
the ovulatory/menstrual cycle,
3073.52 which I personally think is
one of the coolest mechanisms
3076.48 in all of biology,
which is that--
3079.21 remember the
follicle that housed
3081.01 that one egg that
was the selected
3083.23 egg that became the mature egg?
3084.88 And that follicle, which
no longer contains the egg
3087.76 because the egg took
off and ovulated,
3089.53 is called the corpus luteum.
3090.88 And the corpus luteum starts
making three hormones, which
3094.72 include estradiol, I
think called inhibin,
3096.628 but the most important hormone,
the one that you really
3098.92 need to know about,
is that it starts
3100.6 producing very high
levels of progesterone.
3104.5 Progesterone levels
start to increase
3107.89 about the time of
ovulation, although just
3110.35 prior to ovulation.
3111.53 And over the next second
half of the ovulatory cycle--
3116.24 so about 14 days if
it's a 28-day cycle,
3117.977 a little bit longer or
a little bit shorter,
3119.81 depending on the
length of cycle.
3121.185 Levels of progesterone
in the second half
3123.04 of the ovulatory cycle are
going to increase by 1,400 fold
3128.2 compared to what they
were in the first half
3130.78 of the ovulatory cycle.
3132.74 So again, if we
were to characterize
3134.29 the menstrual/ovulatory cycle
in broad strokes, what we would
3138.85 say is that FSH
and estrogen mark
3142.69 the initial part the first half,
the so-called follicular phase,
3146.71 and that the estrogen and
FSH set in motion ovulation,
3150.97 and they prime the
system for the production
3153.7 of a corpus luteum, which
produces progesterone.
3156.67 And the second
half of all of this
3158.74 is called the luteal phase.
3161.03 The second half of the
ovulatory/menstrual cycle
3163.21 is the luteal phase
because of corpus luteum,
3166.6 this otherwise discarded tissue
that produces progesterone.
3170.56 What does progesterone do?
3172.21 Well, progesterone impacts
the uterine lining,
3176.71 so-called endometrium
or the lining,
3178.81 the mucous lining of the uterus
where that egg that's ovulated
3183.22 is potentially going to
implant if it's fertilized.
3186.7 And so in a kind of
perfect way-- or I
3189.58 should say, in a
seemingly perfect way--
3192.4 the egg is off on its way.
3193.84 It might get fertilized.
3195.98 The remnants of the compartment
that let go of that egg
3199.76 produce a hormone that then
prepares the endometrial lining
3203.93 of the uterus for the potential
implantation of that egg.
3207.32 It's basically making the
bed for the fertilized egg
3210.17 to potentially embed in,
to implant in, and then
3213.77 achieve all the nourishment that
it needs to grow, eventually,
3217.04 into a healthy embryo and child.
3219.38 Just an amazing set of
biological mechanisms,
3222.23 if you ask me, because
what you're observing here
3225.92 is an incredible
economy of function
3228.17 whereby the same
cellular components that
3230.69 are producing the egg,
well, some of them
3232.48 are being discarded,
but they're not being
3234.23 discarded without purpose.
3236.138 They're being
discarded in a way that
3237.68 triggers the onset of
hormonal expression
3241.04 that then prepares
the fertilized
3242.48 egg to be in an enriched
environment in which it
3245.15 can thrive.
3246.0 Now, I realize that
was a lot of detail.
3247.67 But we have a couple
of key themes.
3249.59 We've got the
hypothalamus, GnRH.
3251.57 We've got the pituitary
with LH and FSH,
3254.09 and those hormones
travel to the ovary.
3256.56 The ovary has eggs in a
vault, basically immature eggs
3260.99 in a vault. Some of those
are activated by the presence
3264.05 of FSH and LH each month.
3266.09 And one of those eggs will
be selected and will ovulate.
3270.2 The remnants of the
follicle and egg
3272.06 that are not selected, the
chromosomes that you don't need
3275.03 disappear in the polar body.
3276.83 And the corpus luteum gives
rise to progesterone and sets
3280.46 in motion the second half of
the ovulatory menstrual cycle,
3284.07 which is the luteal phase,
which is essentially
3286.67 the potential for
that fertilized egg
3288.5 to embed in a nice,
nourishing environment.
3290.632 And of course, we
should all be thinking,
3292.34 if the egg is fertilized
and then it lays down
3294.65 in the nice, comfy
uterine lining
3296.72 that's been prepared
by progesterone
3299.12 in the corpus luteum, well,
then everything's fine and good.
3302.78 But what if fertilization
doesn't occur?
3304.517 Well, we all know what happens
if fertilization doesn't occur.
3307.1 If fertilization does not
occur for whatever reason,
3309.98 that uterine lining
is going to shed.
3312.752 And that's actually what's
referred to as the period.
3314.96 It's the actual removal--
3317.57 or the departure, rather--
3319.22 of the thickened
endometrium lining
3323.06 of the uterus when
fertilization has not occurred.
3328.42 And of course, if
that happens, we
3330.13 need another ovulatory
menstrual cycle.
3332.44 So how does that happen?
3333.44 Well, the hormone inhibin is
also made by the corpus luteum
3336.94 and doesn't go quite as high
as the hormone progesterone.
3341.32 But it kind of tracks that
increase in progesterone
3344.92 that occurs in the second
half of the ovulatory cycle.
3347.86 But then, if fertilization
does not occur,
3350.98 inhibin levels start to drop.
3353.29 And what I haven't told
you is what inhibin does.
3355.96 Inhibin, in concert with
other hormones like estrogen,
3359.71 feed back to the hypothalamus
and prevent the further release
3363.46 of follicle-stimulating hormone
and luteinizing hormone.
3365.92 If you have an egg that gets
fertilized and can implant,
3369.82 well, then you don't
want more eggs to mature.
3373.42 You want to hold on to
the ones in the vault.
3375.52 You don't want them to mature.
3377.56 And hormones like
inhibin and, again,
3379.768 working with other
hormones are going
3381.31 to prevent the secretion
of things like FSH and LH.
3384.58 Now, typically, people are not
getting pregnant every month.
3387.82 In fact, that's not possible.
3389.483 And part of the reason
it's not possible
3391.15 is that if the
fertilized egg implants,
3393.11 there are a number of
different hormone cascades
3395.11 that shut down the production
of things like GnRH, FSH, and LH
3399.34 in ways that prevent further
maturation of follicles
3402.73 and a follicular phase.
3403.93 But in the instance where
fertilization doesn't occur
3407.24 and menstruation occurs--
3409.15 and I should mention that
the duration of menstruation,
3412.12 the actual bleeding,
typically is anywhere from one
3414.5 to five days.
3415.84 The, quote, unquote,
"heaviness,"
3417.58 the lightness or heaviness of
that bleeding will depend on--
3421.27 you guessed it-- the amount of
progesterone that is secreted
3424.87 from the corpus luteum.
3425.98 That's one of the
key players there.
3428.2 And if menstruation occurs,
well, then inhibin levels
3434.02 also drop.
3434.62 Progesterone levels also drop.
3436.15 And when that occurs,
there's a positive feedback
3440.14 signal up at the level
of the pituitary.
3443.24 The pituitary
literally can register
3445.3 how much inhibin and
progesterone and estrogen
3448.03 is present in the bloodstream.
3449.57 And if those levels are
sufficiently low, well,
3452.8 then GnRH gets secreted again,
FSH gets secreted again,
3456.85 and LH gets secreted again.
3459.08 And the first half
the follicular phase
3461.26 of the menstrual cycle
initiates all over again.
3464.48 It's hard to overstate how
beautifully orchestrated
3466.99 this entire system is--
3468.76 The number of feedback loops
and feed-forward loops.
3471.4 I think if you can just
generally understand
3473.38 that the first half of the
menstrual/ovulatory cycle
3476.08 is marked by the maturation
of the follicles and FSH
3478.96 and that the second
half is marked
3480.82 by the accumulation
of progesterone
3483.19 and the thickening
of the uterine lining
3484.87 should fertilization
and implantation occur,
3487.69 I think that you will
certainly understand
3489.82 the female reproductive
cycle better than most people
3492.46 out there.
3493.125 It will also help you
understand a number of things
3495.25 that are sometimes associated
with the female reproductive
3497.72 cycle.
3498.22 For instance, there
are data showing
3499.72 that, in many, not all, but
in many women, in the four
3504.29 to five days prior to
ovulation, there is
3507.01 a dramatic increase in libido.
3508.81 That dramatic
increase in libido is
3510.67 triggered by a number of
things, but some of those things
3513.58 include the spike
in FSH that occurs,
3516.1 the spike in LH that occurs,
and some associated increases
3520.51 in androgens, things like
DHEA and testosterone,
3524.03 which, just as in males
can be related to libido,
3527.74 in females trigger libido.
3529.24 You can imagine why this would
be an effective mechanism
3531.94 to have in place in females if
the goal, as it were, certainly
3537.07 of the egg, perhaps not
of the woman as a whole,
3540.8 but if the goal is to
fertilize the egg--
3544.06 so increases in
libido just prior
3545.89 to the onset of ovulation.
3548.41 There's also been a lot
of discussion and interest
3551.53 and, frankly, data
exploring the malaise
3554.92 that it can occur
at certain portions
3556.66 of the menstrual cycle.
3558.82 And there's a lot of
misconception about this.
3561.13 A lot of people have focused
on the malaise that can occur
3565.75 around the time of bleeding.
3567.73 But there are
actually stronger data
3570.4 to support the fact that some,
again, some, not all women
3574.12 experience a kind of
malaise sometimes associated
3576.67 with anxiety, sometimes not,
that's associated with the mid
3580.57 to second half of
the luteal phase
3584.4 of the
ovulatory/menstrual cycle.
3587.55 And that, despite what
people commonly think,
3591.15 is not associated with
elevated levels of estrogen.
3593.76 It's actually associated with
the depletion in estrogen
3596.52 levels that can occur
during certain portions
3599.31 of that second half
of the luteal phase
3601.89 of the menstrual cycle.
3603.37 So again, this is
highly variable.
3606.81 For some people, they
might not experience
3608.73 any malaise at any point
during their menstrual cycle.
3611.49 Other individuals
also, for instance,
3613.06 might not experience any
variation in their libido
3615.44 at any point during
their menstrual cycle.
3617.19 Again, highly
variable, and yet there
3618.84 are some statistically
significant trends
3621.06 that have been
observed that tracked
3622.8 very specific
hormonal components
3624.42 within the menstrual cycle.
3625.74 Again, this will all
be very contextual.
3628.62 And of course, this can play out
in a number of different ways.
3631.62 So for instance, some women
experience very heightened
3633.87 levels of sensitivity
to caffeine
3635.58 at certain portions of
their menstrual cycle.
3637.65 Other women experience
more cramping than others
3640.942 at different portions of
their menstrual cycle.
3642.9 Tremendous variation from
individual to individual.
3646.2 One of the--
3647.55 I view it as an advantage.
3648.78 But one of the things that
many females can really do
3653.31 and experience because they have
cycles that occur every month
3656.1 that are fairly dramatic
in terms of their levels
3658.8 of hormones-- so for instance,
a more than 1,000-fold increase
3662.76 in progesterone during the
luteal phase of the menstrual
3665.1 cycle and, I should
also mention,
3667.11 a 200-fold increase in estrogen
during the period just prior
3670.35 to ovulation.
3671.16 That's why they always say
estrogen primes progesterone.
3674.393 That's what you learn in
kind of basic endocrinology
3676.56 when you're learning
the menstrual cycle.
3677.86 Estrogen in the first half
of the menstrual cycle
3679.902 primes progesterone
in the second half
3681.9 of the
ovulatory/menstrual cycle.
3684.19 Well, those estrogen increases
just prior to ovulation
3687.93 are in part responsible for
the increases in libido.
3692.25 But it's also the presence of
increased androgen just prior
3695.49 to ovulation.
3696.12 So there's a lot of
complex interplay.
3698.37 I think what we will
do is we will reserve
3700.5 the discussion about
libido, per se,
3703.41 and some of the
other aspects related
3704.97 to sexual
differentiation that we
3706.14 were talking about earlier
for a future episode.
3708.14 But hopefully now
you have in mind
3709.74 what the ovulatory/menstrual
cycle is.
3711.99 It is a signal from the
brain, from the hypothalamus,
3715.42 which then triggers a
signal from the pituitary,
3717.66 an endocrine gland, which then
signals the release of hormones
3722.04 that travel to the
ovary and that control
3724.59 two things, maturation of eggs
and the identification of one
3728.25 egg in particular and then
preparation of the milieu,
3733.65 the environment in which
that fertilized egg could
3735.99 potentially land and mature
into a healthy embryo and child.
3741.13 So if you have that
framed up in your mind
3743.14 and even if you just
extracted maybe 10% to 15%
3746.148 of the hormones and
different aspects
3747.69 that I described up until now,
I would consider you far more
3752.19 knowledgeable about this entire
process than 99% of people
3756.0 out there, certainly not
the OB/GYNs and urologists,
3759.27 but the 99% of
individuals out there.
3762.49 It also frames up for
us the second half
3765.57 of this whole story about
fertility and fertilization,
3767.98 which is the generation of sperm
and how the sperm eventually
3772.74 arrive at the egg and how
certain sperm are selected
3776.07 to potentially
fertilize that egg,
3778.86 whereas others never
really stand a chance.
3781.15 So next we're going
to talk about sperm.
3783.062 We're going to talk
about what sperm are,
3784.77 where they are generated,
and how they are generated,
3786.978 and how they need to
travel both within the male
3789.39 and within the female in
order to allow fertilization
3792.84 to potentially occur.
3793.92 I'd like to take a
brief break and thank
3796.35 our sponsor, InsideTracker.
3798.6 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
3801.24 that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA
3803.67 to help you better
understand your body
3805.41 and help you reach
your health goals.
3807.21 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
3809.82 for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact
3812.772 your immediate and
long-term health
3814.23 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
3816.775 The problem with a
lot of blood and DNA
3818.4 tests out there, however,
is that you get data
3820.59 back about metabolic
factors, lipids, and hormones
3823.4 and so forth, but you don't
know what to do with those data.
3825.9 InsideTracker
solves that problem
3827.61 and makes it very easy
for you to understand
3829.8 what sorts of nutritional,
behavioral, maybe even
3833.4 supplementation-based
interventions
3835.68 you might want to
take on in order
3837.36 to adjust the numbers of those
metabolic factors, hormones,
3840.03 lipids, and other
things that impact
3841.74 your immediate and
long-term health to bring
3843.81 those numbers into the
ranges that are appropriate
3846.27 and indeed optimal for you.

3858.73 So we've covered the
ovulatory cycle in females.
3861.69 And I confess, it was
a lot of information
3864.24 with a lot of
biological nomenclature.
3866.37 But I promise you that
many of those same themes
3869.13 and indeed the same
names and nomenclature
3871.92 will show up in the
discussion that we're
3873.66 going to have now, which is
about the generation of sperm.
3876.52 Now, sperm are similar
to eggs in the sense
3880.452 that they are part
of the germline.
3881.91 They are these protected
cells, protected in the sense
3884.59 that the activities
of an individual
3887.62 are not going to change the
genetic makeup of those cells.
3892.07 Now, again, there are
instances in which
3894.22 mutagens, such as
chemicals, could disrupt
3897.73 the genomes of the germ
cells in males, just
3900.91 as it could in females.
3901.97 But in general, the
activities, the things
3904.51 that we do, the
experiences we have,
3906.61 doesn't tend to change
the genome of those cells.
3909.41 However, there are a lot
of lifestyle factors--
3911.453 dos and don'ts, nutrition and
supplements and prescription
3913.87 drugs, et cetera-- that can
indeed modify the quality
3917.77 of the sperm.
3918.85 And we'll talk about
what sperm quality means.
3920.9 But the point is that the sperm
cell, much like the egg cell,
3927.31 are both germline cells.
3928.947 They are not like somatic cells.
3930.28 They are unique populations.
3931.6 And let's just remember what
the job of the sperm cell is.
3934.48 The job of the sperm cell is
to deliver the genetic material
3938.2 from the father and to do that
in the form of a haploid cell.
3942.92 So that means 23
chromosomes, 22 autosomes,
3947.74 one so-called sex chromosome--
3950.445 again, not sex the verb,
at least not in this case.
3952.57 Sex, the verb, is
a discussion we're
3954.16 going to have in a few
minutes, but sex the noun.
3957.07 The sex chromosome can either
be an X chromosome or a Y
3960.7 chromosome.
3961.97 So 22 autosomes and
then one sex chromosome
3964.63 is going to be contained
within the sperm
3966.91 because it's a haploid
cell, not a diploid cell.
3969.1 Remember, the egg was diploid,
then it became haploid.
3971.35 The sperm cells
are cells that are
3974.617 created through the
division of other cells.
3976.45 But after that division occurs
through a process called
3978.88 meiosis, the sperm cell is
going to contain 23 chromosomes,
3984.58 consisting of 22 autosomes
and one sex chromosome.
3987.49 And the sperm that manages
to deposit its DNA contents
3992.2 into the egg, to
fertilize the egg,
3994.18 will either have an X
sex chromosome or a Y sex
3998.47 chromosome.
3999.19 And the Y sex
chromosome has a number
4001.56 of different genes on
that chromosome that
4004.02 will suppress, for
instance, the development
4006.87 of the female reproductive axis.
4009.39 One good example would be the
Müllerian-inhibiting hormone,
4012.24 or MIH.
4013.38 The gene for
Müllerian-inhibiting hormone,
4015.79 which is a hormone that prevents
the formation of the Müllerian
4018.78 ducts, which is part of the
female reproductive structure,
4022.41 well, that gene controls the
prevention of the development
4027.78 of the female genitalia
and in doing so promotes
4032.07 the development of
the male genitalia.
4033.69 And there are other
examples of genes
4035.01 that are on the Y
chromosome that give you
4036.9 a what we call male phenotype.
4039.227 You have genotype and phenotype.
4040.56 By the way, in case you
haven't heard this in a while
4042.99 from your high school biology--
4044.04 or if you never heard
it, no big deal--
4045.665 karyotype is the
complement of chromosome--
4049.26 XX or XY.
4050.352 And there are
individuals out there
4051.81 that are XXY or XYY, a
discussion for our episode
4055.53 on sex differentiation.
4056.76 That's karyotype with a K.
4058.71 Then there's genotype, which
are the genes that you have.
4061.23 And then there's phenotype,
spelled P-H-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E,
4066.84 phenotype.
4067.65 And the phenotype
is how the genes,
4071.53 which then code for RNA,
which code for protein,
4074.91 how those are expressed in
terms of things like eye color.
4077.613 So eye color is a phenotype.
4078.78 Height is a phenotype.
4079.8 Hair color is a phenotype.
4080.94 So you have karyotype,
genotype, and phenotype.
4082.93 Well, what we need to do is
we need to bring together
4085.65 that sperm, which is
haploidd it contains those 23
4088.71 chromosomal strandes--
4090.66 with either an X or
a Y. Sex chromosome
4093.03 is the 23rd chromosome.
4094.35 We need to get that
cell to the egg.
4097.899 And so when we talk about
spermatogenesis, of course,
4101.17 we are talking about the
generation of sperm cells.
4104.069 But what we're really talking
about is the generation
4106.41 of cells whose job is to deliver
the genetic material from dad
4110.31 to the egg within the female
in a way that increases
4115.68 the probability that not only
will that egg be fertilized
4118.71 but that it will progress in
a healthy way with each set
4122.88 of chromosomes from
mom and from dad--
4124.89 each set of 23
chromosomes, that is--
4127.56 will progress in a healthy way,
will implant in a healthy way,
4131.85 and will maintain and grow in a
healthy way to a healthy embryo
4136.77 and child and eventually adult.
That's the job of the sperm.
4141.18 So as we talk about
spermatogenesis,
4143.34 let's just remember that
and why they're there
4146.067 in the first place.
4146.859 Now, a few things about
sperm that are interesting,
4149.55 besides the fact
that they're haploid
4151.62 and besides the fact that,
as you all know, they swim.
4154.213 They have a head and a tail.
4155.38 They actually have a head,
a mid region, and a tail,
4157.547 and that mid region turns
out to be very important.
4159.729 It's something we'll come
back to again and again.
4161.812 That mid region is really
key for the ability for sperm
4164.52 to engage in forward
progression to swim forward.
4167.7 It involves the activity
of mitochondria,
4170.17 which are involved in
generation of ATP, which
4173.58 is involved in all aspects
of energy and all cells.
4176.34 But let's just remember that
the sperm are swimming cells.
4180.149 And in order to create
a really good swimmer
4183.3 or set of swimmers, you
need a couple of things.
4185.68 First of all, within the testes
is where the sperm develop.
4189.99 And unlike in females
and unlike in the ovary,
4193.56 there's no vault of sperm.
4195.12 The sperm are continually
being generated.
4197.64 It takes about 60
days for sperm to be
4200.22 born from their parent cells--
4202.71 because cells actually
give rise to other cells,
4204.76 that's the it works-- to be
born from their parent cells
4206.79 and then matured to
the point where they
4208.457 can be a really good swimmer.
4209.67 Now, that doesn't mean
that a bunch of sperm
4213.6 are made on day one, and then
60 days later, all those sperm
4217.56 are deployed in the
form of ejaculate,
4219.39 and then the cycle
starts over again.
4221.14 So it's a little different than
the ovulatory menstrual cycle.
4223.74 Rather, at any given point
in time-- like right now,
4226.53 if you have testes, you have
some sperm in your testes that
4229.77 are immature and cannot swim,
cannot deliver those contents
4235.35 to--
4235.95 those genetic contents,
rather-- to the female egg.
4238.77 And you have some
sperm that are mature,
4240.51 and you very likely have
some sperm that are so mature
4243.78 that they are dying off
or that they're dead.
4246.09 Almost certainly, also,
regardless of your age,
4248.73 you have some sperm that are
healthier than others, that are
4251.64 better swimmers than others.
4253.18 This is just the way
the system works.
4256.15 Now, the process
of spermatogenesis
4259.212 involves a couple of things,
but a lot of the players
4261.42 are the same as the
process of developing
4263.88 the so-called oocyte,
the immature egg.
4268.18 We've got GnRH from
the hypothalamus.
4270.523 That's going to be a player.
4271.69 We have FSH,
follicle-stimulating hormone,
4273.888 although the name's a little
bit of a misnomer in the context
4276.43 of spermatogenesis, because in
the context of spermatogenesis,
4279.43 there is no follicle.
4280.563 What we're really
talking about is
4281.98 FSH for stimulating the
maturation of the sperm cell,
4286.31 so not egg follicle
but sperm cell.
4288.34 But we still have GnRH,
FSH, LH, and rather
4292.39 than the ovary being the
target of those hormones,
4294.76 it's going to be the testes.
4296.48 So most everybody should know
that the testes and the ovaries
4300.4 are the so-called gonads.
4302.83 The testes, of course,
reside outside of the body.
4306.25 There are instances
where the testes fail
4309.16 to descend during development.
4310.66 Certainly, if the
testes don't descend
4312.57 on time, that's something that
doctors need to be made aware
4315.07 of, the pediatrician
should be made aware of,
4316.945 because that can
prevent fertility.
4320.02 Why would that be?
4321.02 Well, it turns out
that the testes
4323.41 reside outside the
body in the scrotum
4325.63 because the
temperature conditions
4328.54 under which
spermatogenesis can occur
4331.03 and under which healthy
sperm can be maintained
4334.42 are very restricted and is
approximately 2 degrees cooler
4340.21 than the rest of the body.
4341.99 This is very important.
4343.45 I think this is something that
used to be discussed a lot more
4346.18 but isn't discussed
so much these days.
4348.88 But keeping the
testes cool enough--
4351.053 doesn't necessarily mean keeping
them cold, although there
4353.47 is a place for
using cold exposure,
4355.3 deliberate cold
exposure, to improve
4357.7 sperm quality and
number and perhaps even
4359.89 testosterone levels.
4360.98 We'll talk about that
a little bit later.
4362.688 But keeping the
testes about 2 degrees
4366.19 cooler than the rest of
the body is absolutely key.
4369.2 If sperm get too hot, they die.
4371.95 And if spermatocytes, the
cells that give rise to sperm,
4374.59 get too warm, well, then
oftentimes the sperm
4377.62 that develop are not
healthy, not healthy
4380.427 in a number of ways.
4381.26 Either they can't engage in
fast forward progression--
4384.37 that is, swimming-- or
they will lack the ability
4388.45 to deposit their DNA
contents within the egg.
4391.36 So again, whatever is
contained in the ejaculate
4394.06 is going to be a mixture of
different sperm qualities.
4396.31 And sperm of different ages will
impact the quality, but also
4400.78 the temperature under which
those sperm developed is
4405.13 going to impact their quality.
4406.75 And so we're going to get
into tools a little bit
4409.27 later, as I mentioned, but just
to give you a simple takeaway.
4412.42 If you are hoping to conceive
in the next 90 days--
4416.08 the spermatogenesis
cycle take 60 days,
4418.24 but then the sperm actually have
to migrate from the testicle
4421.63 into the so-called epididymis,
which is a related structure,
4425.17 and then into the
vas deferens and then
4427.33 into the urethra, where it
can be part of the ejaculate.
4429.82 In order for sperm to
do all that properly,
4433.21 undergo that maturation and
then exit in ejaculate in a way
4436.39 that's healthy or that
the sperm is healthy,
4439.93 if you plan to conceive children
or to try and conceive children
4443.74 in the next 90 days, you
definitely want to avoid
4446.98 exposing your testicles--
that is, your scrotum--
4450.67 to elevated temperatures.
4453.08 So that means definitely
avoiding hot tubs,
4456.19 definitely avoiding hot baths.
4457.69 Now, a brief hot bath
or hot tub or hot shower
4459.91 isn't going to be a
problem, although if you're
4462.448 really interested in conceiving,
I would avoid hot tubs
4464.74 and hot baths as
much as possible.
4467.47 Hot showers are probably fine.
4469.94 But if you're going to go
into a sauna, for instance,
4472.22 you might want to
rethink that decision.
4473.887 And if you do decide
to, you almost certainly
4475.9 would want to bring a cold
pack in that you could-- well,
4479.17 hopefully put some material
between the cold pack
4481.27 and the scrotum so you
don't get a cold burn.
4483.46 But put something there, but
keep the scrotal tissue cool.
4488.17 Keep it cold to cool because
heat exposure can really
4492.76 mutate and disrupt
the developing sperm,
4495.79 and it can kill sperm.
4497.18 And so, again, that would
be for an entire 90 days
4500.92 leading up to your
attempts to conceive.
4503.137 Again, we'll get into more tools
later, but a number of people
4505.72 also have probably heard
of the boxers versus briefs
4509.53 controversy, I guess it is,
or whether or not people call
4513.94 it going commando with no
underwear of any kind-- boxers,
4518.32 briefs, briefs, or
otherwise rather.
4520.79 It turns out that the data
on that point to the fact
4523.03 that there isn't really a big
difference in terms of sperm
4525.64 quality if people
wear boxers or briefs
4528.91 or don't wear anything under
their jeans or shorts at all.
4533.5 The scrotum has the ability to
move the testicles far enough
4537.85 away from the body in
order to achieve lower
4539.743 temperatures if it needs to.
4540.91 It achieves that
through a muscle
4542.285 called the cremaster
muscle, which
4543.94 is a really interesting
muscle, believe it or not.
4546.14 I was reading up on the
biology of the cremaster
4548.14 muscle, something
I never thought
4549.16 I'd spend too much time on but
that I ended up spending far
4551.89 too much time reading up about.
4553.393 And it's really fascinating.
4554.56 What you have is a muscle
that is a smooth muscle
4557.71 tissue, unlike skeletal muscle,
which is striated muscle,
4561.46 that is temperature dependent.
4563.12 So it has certain nerve endings,
and it has certain receptors
4566.92 on it that allow it to
respond to local temperature
4569.41 and then to relax in
order to essentially let
4573.28 the testicles to descend further
from the body or to contract
4576.21 and bring the testicles
closer to the body
4577.96 in order to try and maintain
the optimal temperature range.
4580.72 And it turns out the cremaster
muscle can achieve that
4583.215 whether or not people are
wearing boxers or briefs.
4585.34 Although it stands to
reason that any kind of--
4589.007 there's no other name for
it-- undergarments-- you know,
4591.34 I don't know why that word
just seems kind of antiquated--
4593.757 but undergarment that allows
some movement of the scrotum
4597.55 and the testicles should
be sufficient to allow
4599.62 these temperature variations to
occur and keep things in range.
4604.0 That said, a little bit later,
we'll go into some detail,
4607.18 really--
4607.69 because it's
important-- as to why,
4610.09 for instance, if you are
somebody who has big thighs,
4612.4 believe it or not,
that it actually
4613.875 can lower sperm count
substantially, whether or not
4616.0 the big thighs occur
because you're very muscular
4618.042 or the big thighs occur
because you are overweight.
4620.83 It can increase the temperature.
4622.52 If you're sitting
a lot, increases
4624.04 scrotal temperature, for sure.
4625.655 And there are some other things
that can increase scrotal
4628.03 temperature, seat heaters
in cars, for instance--
4631.18 terrible idea, just terrible
idea if you're hoping
4634.03 to conceive in the near future--
4636.71 and again, hot tub,
things of that sort.
4640.4 So temperature modulation
of spermatogenesis and sperm
4644.95 quality and function is key.
4646.283 That relates a little
bit more to tools.
4647.95 But what happens?
4648.76 How does the actual
sperm develop?
4651.22 Well, contained
within the testicle,
4653.47 you have the cells, the
so-called spermatogonia,
4656.83 which differentiate into
so-called spermatocytes.
4658.99 You don't have to
remember all this.
4660.49 And the spermatocytes undergo
this process of meiosis.
4663.11 Meiosis is a form of
cell division, which
4665.41 reduces the chromosome number to
those 23 individual strands as
4669.97 opposed to pairs.
4671.08 So it makes them haploid
as opposed to diploid.
4673.447 Very, very important for reasons
that we talked about earlier.
4676.03 And the meiosis process in
these primordial sperm cells,
4680.68 these immature sperm cells, is
similar to the meiosis process
4684.7 that occurs in eggs when
the chromosomes segregate in
4687.76 that it involves these
spindle-like structures
4690.91 within the cell.
4691.61 Now, why do I keep
bringing up the spindles?
4692.98 Well, it turns out
that the function
4694.24 of the spindle in
the egg and the sperm
4696.1 is heavily dependent on
mitochondrial function.
4699.41 And later when we get into tools
for improving egg and sperm
4702.04 quality, you're going to
hear about a lot of tools
4704.123 for improving mitochondria.
4705.28 And it's not just
because the mitochondria
4707.08 are involved in energy-demanding
aspects of cell biology.
4711.19 But it's also because the
mitochondria in this context
4714.19 are very, very important for
the removal of or the separation
4719.65 of one set of
chromosomes to give you
4721.3 these two sets of haploid
cells, the egg and the sperm.
4724.43 And this is so important because
many failures at fertilization,
4729.73 many failures at implantation,
many, many miscarriages,
4733.63 and many birth defects that
do survive after birth that
4737.05 are very detrimental, such as
trisomies and things like that,
4741.43 occur because the spindles
don't effectively pull apart
4745.18 the chromosomes in
typically the egg,
4748.12 but it can also
occur in the sperm.
4750.71 So the spindles and the
fact that mitochondria
4752.95 are rich on the spindle are
very important for generating
4755.47 these haploid sperm--
again, 23 individual strands
4757.75 of chromosomes.
4759.4 That's occurring
inside of the testes.
4763.04 So there's not as much
long-distance migration
4765.88 of the spermatocytes
and the sperm cells
4769.87 as there is the
egg just when you
4771.837 think about the overall
architecture of the uterus
4773.92 and the Fallopian tubes
compared to the testicles,
4775.54 but there's still
a lot of movement.
4776.69 So within the
testicle, if you were
4778.27 to look at the testicle
in cross-section--
4780.427 and I prefer to call
it that rather than cut
4782.26 the testicle in half.
4783.1 Any time you talk about
anatomy, you actually
4784.45 talk about slicing things.
4785.533 That's what you would do with
a cadaver is what I teach
4788.53 and we do in my
laboratory and, frankly,
4792.01 in biological laboratories
all over the place.
4794.3 But when you talk about it, you
talk about if you were to take
4796.883 a visual cross-section
through the testicle,
4798.917 what you would find is that
there are a lot of different
4801.25 little tubes, a lot of
ducts, D-U-C-T-S, ducts.
4805.72 Those are pathways.
4806.77 And the main ducts that are
important for this discussion
4810.55 are called the
seminiferous tubules.
4813.49 So it's a mesh-like
or network structure
4816.91 of tubes in the testicle.
4818.53 And the immature sperm sit
on a little compartment
4823.18 along the edge of those tubes.
4824.81 And as they mature, they
move towards the center
4827.14 of those tubes.
4827.848 And then when they
are mature enough,
4829.39 those sperm cells actually drop
into the hollow of the tube,
4833.38 and then can travel
through those tubes
4835.78 to a structure that's along
the side of the testicle called
4840.4 the epididymis.
4842.2 The epididymis, again,
is a series of ducts.
4845.02 And then the epididymis
converges with something
4847.87 called the vas deferens.
4849.937 I think in high school,
we all remember this
4851.77 by thinking about it's
the vast difference.
4853.6 I don't know who
came up with that.
4855.37 I think it was a
young girl sitting
4857.182 to the left of me that
was like, oh, it's
4858.89 like the vast difference.
4859.63 I never forgot that.
4860.45 I don't know.
4860.59 Maybe it was the topic matter.
4861.52 Maybe it was her.
4862.03 Maybe it was some
combination of the two.
4863.738 But in any case, the sperm
go from the seminiferous
4865.9 tubules to the
epididymis and then
4869.15 to the vas deferens and then
are contained in the ejaculate,
4872.72 along with seminal fluid.
4874.7 Now, the seminal fluid
is the carrier fluid
4878.63 for the sperm themselves.
4881.427 This is important
because it turns out
4883.01 that a lot of things that can
both negatively or positively
4886.16 impact the quality of the
sperm relates not just
4889.46 to the sperm cells themselves
and the temperature
4891.89 of the environment that
they were matured in,
4895.31 but also to the semen quality.
4898.37 For instance, if you are a heavy
drinker, if you are a smoker,
4903.89 or if you are a regular
user of cannabis,
4907.7 especially if you smoke
cannabis or vape cannabis,
4911.33 you create a lot of
reactive oxygen species
4914.66 that disrupt the chemistry
of the seminal fluid, which
4917.81 disrupts the sperm cells.
4919.14 So it's not a direct action
always on the sperm cell
4921.53 itself, although it can be.
4922.77 So for instance, in the form
of smoked tobacco or cannabis,
4927.418 there are a lot of
carcinogens and mutagens
4929.21 that actually mutate the DNA,
can cause DNA fragmentation,
4932.33 and debilitate sperm.
4933.53 But there are also a lot of
things created by smoking
4937.94 in particular, regardless
of what's being smoked,
4940.91 that can create elevated
reactive oxygen species
4944.15 and disrupt the seminal fluid
that the sperm are contained
4948.77 in in the so-called
ejaculate, the semen.
4951.23 Now, this will also become a
relevant conversation later
4955.01 when we briefly talk
about vasectomies.
4957.56 Vasectomies are
literally a cutting
4961.4 of the vas deferens, which
leads to a situation,
4965.06 provided the surgery
was done correctly,
4966.89 where men can still achieve
all the other aspects
4970.435 of intercourse.
4971.06 They can still achieve erection.
4973.07 They can still achieve orgasm.
4974.93 They can still ejaculate.
4977.18 But when they ejaculate, the
seminal fluid is released,
4980.28 but there are no sperm contained
within the seminal fluid.
4982.82 And it turns out
that vasectomies
4984.77 are a very effective
form of birth control.
4987.41 And they always check
to see if zero sperm
4989.9 and confirm that
zero sperm are being
4991.457 released in the ejaculate.
4992.54 They are reversible.
4993.985 And that is, vasectomies are
reversible, but not always.
4997.73 There are a subset of cases
where it's not reversible,
4999.98 in which case if people
still want to have children,
5002.147 you have to go in and actually
surgically extract sperm
5005.35 from the testicles.
5006.61 But it's a process in which
the vas deferens is altered
5012.01 or severed in a way that
the sperm can't actually
5014.29 exit the testicle.
5015.96 They can get into the
epididymis, usually,
5017.71 but not into the vas deferens
and so on and so forth.
5021.182 So if you've ever wondered
what a vasectomy is,
5023.14 that's what a vasectomy is.
5024.34 And I mentioned vasectomy
now because it illustrates
5028.833 the difference between the
seminal fluid, the semen,
5031.0 and the sperm that
the semen contain.
5034.24 So 60 days to generate the
sperm, another two weeks
5039.01 or so for the sperm to travel
through the various ducts
5042.16 to the point where they can
be contained in the ejaculate.
5045.19 Let's talk about the
sperm cells themselves.
5047.95 The sperm cells, again,
have these 23 pairs
5052.18 of single-strand chromosomes.
5053.89 They're haploid.
5054.92 They have either an X
or a Y sex chromosome
5056.83 as the 23rd so-called
sex chromosome.
5059.11 And as we all know,
they have a head.
5061.0 The head tends to be
oval in most cases.
5064.19 The head contains very
important enzymes and proteins
5067.72 that are designed to fuse
with the much larger egg
5070.99 and to actually take the
membrane of the sperm cell
5073.57 and combine to actually mesh
with the egg cell's membrane
5080.58 and then deliver the genetic
contents to the egg cell,
5084.7 in other words, to
fertilize the egg cell.
5086.88 Now, just behind the head is a
region called the mid region.
5090.48 That mid region is a
slightly thickened region.
5094.29 And here, of course, I'm
talking about healthy sperm cell
5097.08 morphology.
5097.68 Morphology simply means shape.
5099.33 A mid region-- that
mid region has a bunch
5102.45 of things related
to cell motility
5104.58 and to the forward
progression of the cells.
5107.56 First of all, it is chock a
block full of mitochondria.
5110.555 In fact, if you
were to look just
5111.93 behind the head of the
sperm, what you'd see
5114.24 is that it is completely
surrounded by mitochondria.
5118.647 There are mitochondria elsewhere
in the cell, but most of them
5121.23 are contained in this
mid region compartment
5123.063 just behind the
head of the sperm.
5125.97 And that thick region is where
the tail movement of the sperm,
5130.65 the flagellation back and forth,
is actually generated from.
5137.85 Much like if you were to
hold a rope, like a battle
5140.73 rope in the gym, and you
were to whip the battle rope,
5145.02 the whip at the
one end of the rope
5147.09 is what allows for the sort
of-- let's just call it
5152.16 what it is-- the
curves in the rope,
5153.87 the oscillations, the
rising and falling
5155.73 of the rope all the
way out to the end.
5157.77 It is the force of the whip
right at that end that with
5162.645 the battle rope you're
doing with your hand--
5164.52 and with the sperm, that is
occurring just behind the head
5167.46 of the sperm--
5168.3 that is actually going
to dictate how fast
5171.66 and how well that
sperm can swim.
5174.15 And indeed, the sperm
has to swim very far.
5176.7 How far?
5177.51 Well, on a relative scale--
5179.34 and again, these are estimations
because they're going to be--
5182.82 how should we say?
5183.75 There will be differences
in the distance
5186.9 from the head of the penis and
where the ejaculation occurs
5193.02 to the cervix, depending
on the relative size
5195.78 of the vaginal canal
and the penis that
5198.27 delivers the ejaculate
to the vaginal canal.
5200.22 But once the sperm arrive
at the cervix, which
5204.57 is at the back of
the vaginal canal
5207.42 just at the opening
to the uterus,
5209.34 once the sperm arrive
there, the distance
5212.94 from the cervix to
the egg, of course,
5215.88 will vary depending
on where that egg is
5218.01 in its ovulatory
trajectory, its pathway.
5220.92 But it is akin, if
you scale for size,
5224.43 to the distance between Los
Angeles and San Francisco,
5228.91 which is many, many
hundreds of miles.
5230.55 So those sperm have
to swim very far.
5232.71 Now, of course, if the sperm are
delivered in the vaginal canal
5236.1 somewhat further away, they
will have further to go.
5239.015 If they're delivered right
at the cervical opening,
5241.14 they will have less far to go.
5242.82 The very effective swimming
sperm swim very fast.
5247.6 So they are able to
accomplish that distance
5249.72 in just a few days.
5250.92 And this relates to
a discussion that we
5254.04 will get into in
a lot more detail
5255.84 later as to how often couples
should have intercourse
5259.74 if they're trying to conceive.
5261.313 Many people might think,
well, it's every day.
5263.23 However, the more frequent
the ejaculation, the lower
5266.28 the concentration of
sperm in each ejaculate.
5269.04 So this is not a
discussion about how often
5271.11 to have intercourse depending
to your preferences,
5273.57 for pleasure or bonding
or whatever reason.
5275.76 This is a discussion about
how often to have intercourse
5278.61 in order to optimize the
probability of fertilization
5282.03 of the egg.
5282.81 There's some general rules
that, of course, come to mind,
5285.52 which is ejaculations close
to ovulation-- both before,
5290.35 during, or sometimes after--
5292.83 are obviously advantageous.
5295.65 But you will also hear
OB/GYNs and urologist
5298.62 suggesting intercourse
every other day
5301.29 leading up to the
day of ovulation,
5304.02 starting about three
to four days out
5306.54 from the day of ovulation.
5308.34 So we got a little
bit sidetracked,
5310.17 albeit I think appropriately so,
in focusing on fertilization.
5314.598 But what we were talking
about right up until the point
5316.89 of that is the anatomy
of the sperm itself,
5319.84 which is the head,
the mid region that
5321.45 contains all those
mitochondria, and then the tail.
5324.28 Now, what we haven't discussed
is the actual generation
5327.75 of the sperm.
5328.54 So if you're a male
or if you're a female,
5331.57 I think it's really
important to understand
5333.57 how spermatogenesis works.
5336.81 Spermatogenesis works
in much in the same way
5340.05 that the generation and
maturation of eggs work,
5343.578 although, as I
mentioned before, it's
5345.12 going to occur ongoing
throughout the cycle
5348.69 of the male's life
after puberty.
5351.63 We already talked about
puberty, and I'll just
5354.27 cover this in two
or three sentences
5356.1 as it relates to males.
5357.48 And it's essentially
the same thing.
5361.35 The hypothalamus, up until
the point of puberty,
5364.35 is providing suppression
of the release
5367.62 of gonadotropin-releasing
hormone.
5369.18 Then some biological clock,
which is still not clearly
5373.32 understood-- it's probably not
leptin coming from body fat.
5378.09 Again, unlike in the female,
it's probably not leptin
5380.805 coming from body fat.
5381.68 But some other signal
arrives to the hypothalamus,
5384.92 removes that
inhibition, and GnRH,
5386.87 gonadotropin-releasing
hormone, is now
5388.85 released onto the pituitary.
5390.5 A bunch of hormones are
deployed from the pituitary
5392.87 as a consequence.
5393.66 The two most important ones for
the context of this discussion
5396.59 are follicle-stimulating
hormone and luteinizing hormone.
5400.29 Follicle-stimulating hormone
and luteinizing hormone
5402.6 travel to the
testes, and they're
5405.35 going to do two main things.
5406.77 One, they're going to trigger
the production of testosterone.
5410.09 And they're going to
trigger the production
5412.37 of the sperm themselves.
5413.78 They're going to set in
motion, for essentially
5415.88 the rest of the life of the
male, the production of sperm.
5420.47 They're going to initiate
the spermatogenesis cycle,
5422.69 and that cycle is
going to be ongoing
5424.232 at various stages
for different sperm
5426.32 for the rest of the man's life.
5428.99 This is very different than
the triggering of development
5433.76 of oocytes and eggs in females,
where there's an existing
5437.6 vault. That vault can be
depleted to the point of zero
5440.345 where it can't occur again.
5441.47 Men can generate sperm
their entire lifetime.
5443.87 Of course, there's
a diminishment
5445.52 of sperm production in
very, very late age,
5448.88 say, 80s and 90s or 100s.
5450.26 But believe it or not, there
are still sperm being produced.
5452.76 The quality of those
sperm is another question.
5455.03 So everything we're
going to talk about now
5457.16 is essentially puberty onward.
5459.95 Prior to that,
testicles are present,
5462.35 but they're not
generating sperm.
5464.63 Ejaculation isn't possible,
or if it is possible,
5467.36 it's very unlikely and
unusual, and it's not
5470.12 going to contain sperm.
5472.93 Everything we're going
to talk about now
5474.73 is puberty forward, so puberty
onward to the rest of life.
5480.25 And luteinizing hormone
secreted from the pituitary acts
5484.63 on the testes and on a
very specific cell type
5487.93 in the testes called the Leydig
egg cells, or Leydig cells,
5490.66 L-E-Y-D-I-G, the Leydig cells.
5493.0 The Leydig cells of the testes
are what produce testosterone.
5497.74 Testosterone is going to
have two major effects.
5501.56 And here I mean really
major because it
5503.29 has many, many hundreds of
effects on different tissues
5505.63 of the body.
5506.18 In fact, that's the definition
of a hormone, really.
5508.347 It's a substance that acts
in an endocrine fashion.
5511.09 It can act on the very
tissue that generated it.
5513.46 So for instance, testosterone
made by the Leydig cells
5515.74 within the testes will
act on the testes,
5517.3 as we'll talk about in a moment.
5518.633 But it can also act
on other tissues.
5521.0 It can act on the
pharynx and larynx
5522.5 and deepen the voice, as
it does during puberty.
5524.5 It can act on the hair follicles
and generate facial hair.
5526.93 It can act on the musculature
and generate protein synthesis
5530.782 and development of
muscle, bone, et
5532.24 cetera, all the
things we associate
5533.698 with puberty and with
testosterone typically.
5537.41 Restricting the conversation
to the effects of testosterone
5540.29 on the testicle itself
and on spermatogenesis,
5543.2 the Leydig cells
make testosterone.
5545.66 And keep in mind that
some of that testosterone
5547.945 will travel
elsewhere in the body
5549.32 and do its thing
for gene expression
5551.48 and the more acute effects
of testosterone on the brain
5554.12 included.
5555.68 But the testosterone
within the testes
5557.9 is at extremely
high concentration.
5560.67 In fact, the concentration of
intratesticular testosterone
5564.83 is at least 100 times higher
than the concentration
5567.97 of testosterone anywhere
else in the body,
5569.72 even though it's being secreted
into the rest of the body.
5572.828 And that's because
there are a number
5574.37 of different so-called
binding proteins and enzymes
5577.64 that sequester the
testosterone within the testes.
5580.467 So the Leydig cells are
making testosterone,
5582.3 and a lot of that
testosterone is acting on
5584.84 and is restricted to the testes.
5586.58 And that turns out to be very
important because testosterone
5591.41 within the testes
acts in concert
5594.53 with a different biological
program that starts with FSH,
5598.16 follicle-stimulating hormone,
that also travels to the testes
5601.37 and acts on a very specific
set of cells that are called
5605.45 supporting cells or,
more specifically,
5607.82 the Sertoli cells.
5609.92 The Sertoli cells
are the cells that
5612.53 generate something called ABP,
or androgen-binding protein.
5616.46 And it is the combination of
testosterone from the Leydig
5619.7 cells and ABP from
the Sertoli cells
5623.06 that is necessary
for spermatogenesis.
5626.66 It's necessary for
those spermatocytes
5629.24 to become what will eventually
be healthy, mature sperm that
5632.96 have really nice shaped oval
heads, have a mid region,
5636.23 chock a block
through mitochondria,
5637.73 and can generate a fast
whipping motion of the tail
5640.34 to swim from the cervix, or
up the vagina into the cervix,
5644.18 and from the cervix to the
egg to fertilize the egg.
5647.78 So it's really a basic set
of chemical players that are
5650.69 involved here and
so basic, in fact,
5653.67 that if you were to disrupt any
one of these chemical players--
5656.48 either the luteinizing
hormone, the FSH,
5659.115 the testosterone from
the Leydig cells,
5660.74 or androgen-binding protein--
5663.05 you would observe
pretty marked disruption
5667.61 in spermatogenesis or the
elimination of sperm entirely.
5671.07 We'll get into a few
deficits in sperm development
5673.76 and sperm number and sperm
function a little bit later.
5676.08 But just keep in mind--
5677.78 or I should say, maybe
sit back and just
5679.76 appreciate that the exact
same players generate
5682.57 from the hypothalamus,
which causes luteinizing
5685.46 hormone and follicle-stimulating
hormone released
5688.16 from the pituitary, which
travels to the gonad, which
5691.4 in this case is the
testicle, which triggers
5693.95 the release of
testosterone from Leydig
5695.63 cells, which triggers the
action of the supporting cells,
5700.13 the Sertoli cells, which make
androgen-binding protein.
5703.49 Testosterone and
androgen-binding protein
5705.23 combine and create a
chemical and actually
5708.62 a structural milieu in which
those little spermatocytes
5712.31 can go from the
walls, from literally
5714.95 the walls of the tubes of
the seminiferous tubules,
5717.53 can mature into healthy,
well-developed sperm,
5719.84 and can hop into those
ducts, those little tubes,
5723.11 and then head off to the
epididymis, where they will
5725.9 reside-- the epididymis is the
tissue nearby the testicles
5729.08 or surrounding one
portion of the testicle--
5731.16 and then eventually fuse
with the vas deferens,
5733.94 can combine with or be
contained with, rather,
5736.88 the seminal fluid, and then can
be ejaculated via the urethra
5741.41 into the female,
where then they can
5743.06 swim very quickly, effectively
the distance, for them anyway,
5746.84 from Los Angeles
to San Francisco,
5748.94 over the course of a very
short period of time,
5751.49 and fertilize the egg.
5753.71 So that's the process of
spermatogenesis, the maturation
5756.65 of sperm, which is ongoing
throughout the lifespan
5760.19 from puberty onward.
5761.66 And in doing so, we talked about
some of the hormonal elements--
5764.54 coming from the hypothalamus
and coming from the pituitary,
5767.66 and within the testes themselves
the Leydig cells, which
5770.54 produce testosterone,
the Sertoli cells,
5772.32 which are the support cells that
allow spermatogenesis to occur.
5777.95 With that in mind,
next I'd like to think
5780.32 about what's actually contained
in the ejaculate in terms
5783.02 of numbers of sperm and
what's really being selected
5786.163 for in terms of the sperm
that actually successfully
5788.33 fertilizes the egg and
what sorts of elements
5790.88 come into play in dictating
whether or not fertilization
5794.48 will or won't occur.
5795.87 And the major themes that
we're going to discuss
5797.93 are frequency of
ejaculation, but really
5801.02 that's just kind of a proxy
for talking about maximizing
5804.59 sperm concentration and quality
of sperm arriving at the egg--
5808.94 because, remember, ovulation
and the menstrual cycle
5811.28 are really about creating the
opportunity for fertilization.
5815.58 And we are also going
to talk about how
5818.03 the vaginal duct,
the vagina, and
5821.72 the milieu around the cervix
and some other elements
5824.96 within the female
herself contribute to
5828.41 and support the sperm in
their journey to the egg
5831.518 and in the likelihood that
they will fertilize the egg.
5833.81 So really what we need to talk
about first is sperm quality.
5837.29 And we should also probably
talk about ejaculate quality,
5840.68 because, as odd as
that theme might seem,
5844.82 really the ejaculate
quality, which
5847.998 has a number of
different parameters,
5849.54 including the number
of mature sperm
5852.62 that are not so mature that
they're swimming slower
5854.78 or are dead, but also
quality of sperm.
5856.56 They have, for
instance, one tail.
5857.977 It's not entirely
uncommon to see sperm
5860.3 with two tails because they
just didn't form properly
5863.06 or sperm that are
not moving very much.
5865.79 In fact, sperm motility is
scored along a scale of 0,
5868.99 1, 2, or 3, 3 being the best,
fast forward progressing.
5872.99 0 is not moving at all.
5874.94 1, they're actually
called twitchers.
5877.382 Twitchers are sperm that
sort of just twitch in place
5879.59 but don't undergo
forward progression.
5881.99 2 is somewhere in between
1 and 3, not surprisingly.
5886.82 Different clinics, different
OB/GYNs, different urologists
5890.825 will throw out
different numbers.
5892.2 But in general, it is hoped
that more than 50% of the sperm
5897.62 should be motile in some way
or another, so not scoring a 0,
5900.47 but a 1, or 2, or ideally a 3.
5903.62 The concentration of sperm--
5905.36 of course, if it's higher within
the ejaculate, the total number
5910.43 of sperm per milliliter of
ejaculate, if that's higher,
5913.76 then there's a
higher probability
5915.29 that one of those sperm
will fertilize the egg.
5918.32 One thing I didn't
mention before when
5920.0 discussing the production
of eggs and ovulation--
5922.058 and I probably should
have, so I will
5923.6 now-- is that most
often only one
5926.48 ovary gives rise to
an ovulating egg.
5931.06 It happens, but it's somewhat
rare for two mature eggs, one
5937.7 from each ovary, to be deployed
during a single ovulation.
5940.965 There's a name for that when it
occurs and both are fertilized.
5943.59 It's called fraternal twins.
5946.19 If a single egg--
5948.11 that, of course, comes
from a single ovary--
5950.24 is fertilized and
the egg splits--
5954.052 and that's something that
happens further along
5956.01 in the process of fertilization
and differentiation
5959.28 of the embryo--
5960.07 well, then what you get
are identical twins.
5963.18 There are other instances that
are quite uncommon in which
5966.457 you can get fraternal twins
through other circumstances.
5968.79 But in general, that's
the way it works.
5970.457 But essentially what
happens is one egg
5972.33 from one ovary-- that's
the most common occurrence.
5974.7 The sperm, once ejaculated
into the vaginal duct,
5978.81 are going to pass
through the cervix
5982.38 and then are going to
swim toward the egg.
5984.57 The egg could be at
varying locations
5987.9 along the female
reproductive axis.
5990.66 Now, this is actually
a very important thing
5992.88 and actually gets right down
to the safety of both the
5996.645 potentially developing
embryo and the mother.
5998.52 There is something referred
to as ectopic pregnancy,
6001.19 and that's when the
pregnancy actually occurs
6004.34 within the Fallopian tubes.
6005.84 So the precise location
in which fertilization
6008.36 between the sperm and the
egg occurs can vary somewhat.
6011.27 But ideally, the fertilized egg
implants into the endometrium
6015.17 or the endometrial
lining of the uterus
6017.33 and develops there as opposed
to within the Fallopian tubes,
6020.58 which is so-called
ectopic pregnancy.
6022.28 Now, where the sperm
and the egg meet exactly
6025.94 can vary, as I mentioned before.
6027.95 But in general, the
faster swimming sperm
6030.83 and the more far along the
ovulatory trajectory the egg
6034.82 are, the higher the probability
of a successful fertilization
6038.03 because of the proximity
to the implantation zone
6040.61 of the uterus.
6041.46 So basically it's all
a probabilities game.
6043.82 It's a probabilities
game related
6045.41 to the number of sperm
cells that encounter the egg
6047.69 and where the egg is in
terms of its ovulatory cycle
6050.42 and also its position where
it is in the ovulatory cycle.
6055.28 The sperm parameters--
or I should
6058.01 say the semen parameters--
and ejaculate parameters
6061.07 that most clinicians
want to see,
6063.29 if you were to give
a sperm sample,
6065.24 would be somewhere in excess of
15 million sperm per milliliter
6071.3 of ejaculate.
6072.92 Now, there's a lot of
discussion nowadays.
6075.11 It seems to be a very
popular news theme
6077.15 to talk about diminishing
sperm counts, the idea that 100
6081.65 years ago or maybe even 35 years
ago, the typical male ejaculate
6085.25 contained 100 million
sperm per milliliter,
6088.01 and nowadays it's down
to 15 to 20 or 50.
6091.04 And indeed, sperm counts
do seem to be declining.
6094.47 And the exact reasons
for that are not clear.
6096.77 I confess I'm a little bit
reluctant to talk about this
6099.062 because there have been a lot
of back and forth discussions
6102.08 about the safety of EMFs,
of electromagnetic fields,
6104.725 and it's not exactly what
we're talking about here.
6106.85 But there are some
excellent data
6109.13 contained in
meta-analyses and reviews
6110.72 that I will provide links
to and that we'll talk about
6112.97 in more detail in a
minute that correlate
6117.0 the advent of smartphones
and in particular caring
6119.73 of smartphones in the pocket
with diminishing sperm counts.
6123.3 Although there are certain
to be other factors that
6126.0 can explain diminishing
sperm counts as well.
6128.49 Dr. Shanna Swan, for instance,
has done beautiful work
6132.51 describing how the
phthalates and the BPAs
6136.26 and so-called
endocrine disruptors
6138.12 might be disrupting
some of the milieu
6139.89 of the seminiferous tubules.
6142.15 So this would be reductions in
testosterone and/or disruptions
6144.96 to the Sertoli cells and
androgen-binding protein
6147.12 brought about by endocrine
disruptors such as phthalates
6149.82 contained in pesticides and
contained on printed receipts
6152.69 and things of that sort.
6153.69 There are some data
that that is negatively
6155.97 impacting sperm counts.
6158.97 How much so is still debatable.
6162.61 There are also quite
good data pointing
6164.77 to the fact that
both the heat-related
6167.43 and the non-heat-related impact
of smartphones and laptops
6172.5 contained on the lap are
impacting sperm count
6175.58 and in a negative way.
6177.202 Again, there's going to
be tremendous variation
6179.16 in the concentration
of sperm from one
6180.842 individual to the next.
6181.8 It will vary according to age
and a number of other factors
6184.74 that we'll talk about
a little bit later.
6187.23 But in general, if somebody
is wishing to conceive,
6190.26 then clinicians like to
see a ejaculate volume
6193.89 of more than 2 milliliters.
6196.72 So ejaculate volume
can be anywhere
6198.87 from 1.5 to 5 milliliters.
6202.57 And that will
strongly be determined
6204.15 by how frequent
ejaculation is occurring.
6207.16 There's a lot that goes
into evaluating the quality
6209.43 of ejaculate and sperm.
6210.78 But basically these huge
variations that are observed
6215.36 of anywhere from 15 million
sperm per milliliter
6218.523 or, in some males who are not
producing sperm for whatever
6220.94 reason-- we'll talk about
those reasons in a little bit--
6224.42 as low as 5 million
sperm per milliliter,
6227.402 all the way up to
100 or maybe even
6228.86 200 million sperm
per milliliter.
6231.2 Huge variation-- the cause
of which is not always clear
6236.06 but is certainly
determined in part
6238.52 by the frequency of ejaculation.
6240.54 So because there are
so many variables
6243.14 impacting why one male
versus another male or even
6246.38 the same male
across the lifespan
6247.79 might have variations in
his concentration of sperm
6250.73 within the ejaculate, let's talk
for a second about frequency
6254.87 of ejaculation as it relates
to the goal of fertility,
6257.325 per se, because that's really
what today's episode is all
6259.7 about.
6260.28 So what I'd like
to talk about next
6261.8 is how people can
increase the probability
6264.38 of a successful
fertilization, focusing
6266.54 both on the components
from the male side
6269.39 and from the female side.
6270.62 And I'm mainly going to couch
this discussion in the context
6273.47 of the so-called natural
method of sexual intercourse
6276.8 and ejaculation in
vivo, within the female.
6281.39 But I will also touch
on some parallel themes
6283.7 as it relates to
in-vitro fertilization
6285.68 and intrauterine insemination.
6288.17 So the idea here is that
we want the maximum number
6292.73 of high-quality sperm--
that is, rapidly forward,
6295.67 motile sperm that are of
the correct morphology--
6298.35 that is, shape.
6299.6 That's going to require
a lot of mitochondria
6302.27 in the mid region,
a well-shaped head--
6304.49 so it's going to be
an oval-shaped head.
6306.17 The tail is going to be a
single tail, not multiple tails.
6308.84 These aren't going to be
the twitcher type of--
6311.36 or immotile type of sperm that
are either twitching in place
6314.6 or aren't moving forward.
6315.68 All of those
components are going
6317.69 to be essential for
increasing the probability
6320.48 of fertilization.
6321.29 But of course, there's
the female side of it,
6323.165 too, which is that
ovulation occurs
6325.1 on just one day during the
menstrual ovulatory cycle.
6328.76 And that egg will be
available for fertilization
6331.49 for approximately 24 hours.
6333.5 Now, keep in mind that
the sperm can survive
6335.93 within the vaginal duct
and within the area
6338.81 around the cervix
and within the uterus
6340.76 and along the female
reproductive tract for anywhere
6344.06 from three to five
or it's even been
6346.13 described as up to seven days.
6347.85 But generally, it's going to
be about three to five days.
6350.42 Now, most women can figure
out the day of their ovulation
6354.2 by counting the total number
of days of their typical cycle.
6357.2 And this is where
it's really useful
6358.7 to have a cycle that's of
more or less regular duration
6362.33 or, rather, of more or
less regular length.
6365.54 So as we talked about
earlier, if somebody's cycle
6368.54 is 21 days or 25 days and it's
21 or 25 days consistently
6372.47 or even 30 days
consistently, that's
6374.72 going to be a far better
scenario to favor fertilization
6377.6 than if it's 20 days
one month and then 21
6380.87 days the next month, but then
suddenly 30 days and then
6383.87 suddenly 35 days.
6385.01 Those varying durations
of the ovulatory cycle
6388.16 make it very hard,
obviously, to time
6390.47 and understand when
ovulation is going to occur.
6392.76 So regular duration
ovulatory cycles
6396.74 are the ideal circumstance, and
they're the ideal circumstance,
6399.77 because even though
the egg is only
6401.24 available for fertilization
for a few days,
6403.032 those sperm can survive for
some period of time, which
6406.16 leads to the issue of
how often should couples
6409.7 be having intercourse.
6411.08 And here, I'm
referring specifically
6413.09 to intercourse with ejaculation.
6414.53 How often should couples
be having intercourse
6416.66 around the time of ovulation
if the specific goal is
6420.95 successful fertilization of the
egg and the creation of a baby?
6425.09 This is leaving aside all
issues, which, of course, are
6428.72 interesting issues, related
to how often people are having
6431.69 intercourse, whether or
not there's ejaculation
6433.97 every time they have intercourse
or not, for sake of pleasure
6436.67 or for sake of pair
bonding and pleasure
6439.49 or for sake of any number
of other potential goals
6442.1 of intercourse.
6442.91 Here I'm only referring
to intercourse
6444.92 as it relates to the goal
of fertilization of the egg.
6449.36 So knowing what we know about
spermatogenesis and the fact
6455.39 that ejaculate is going to
contain a certain concentration
6459.05 of sperm but that within that
ejaculate some of the sperm
6462.83 will be older and less healthy
and some will be optimally
6466.63 mature and some might
even be a little bit
6468.38 immature-- although there's a
tendency for the immature sperm
6470.922 to not have yet exited the
seminiferous tubules, gone
6475.16 into the epididymis
and vas deferens.
6476.87 But given that the
ejaculate contains
6478.58 sperm of varying ages and
therefore varying quality
6482.27 and given that with each
successive ejaculation
6485.18 in a short period
of time there's
6487.46 going to be a decrease in
the concentration of sperm
6490.43 per milliliter of
semen, of ejaculate,
6493.94 we can make some
good arguments as
6496.31 to how often couples
should have intercourse
6499.28 with ejaculation around
the time of ovulation
6501.92 if the goal is to fertilize.
6503.3 If ovulation occurs
on, for instance,
6505.07 day 14 of a cycle--
and here we're
6506.69 using the kind of
standard average
6508.28 of 28 days of the cycle.
6510.0 But for some people
with a 30-day cycle,
6512.73 it could be day 15, or
with a shorter cycle,
6516.21 it could be day
12, for instance.
6517.92 But given a 28-day
average cycle,
6520.26 let's say ovulation occurs
on day 13 or on day 14.
6524.28 And typically, it would occur
on day 14 of a 28-day cycle.
6528.21 Well, then, given how long
sperm can survive inside
6532.35 of the woman, you might think
that the optimal strategy would
6535.02 be to have as much intercourse
with ejaculation in the three
6538.92 or four days leading
up to ovulation, hope
6541.89 that those sperm have swam
as far as they possibly
6544.29 can and will encounter the
egg just as soon as possible
6546.96 after it ovulates.
6548.37 It turns out that's not
the optimal strategy.
6550.32 The optimal strategy is really
to maximize the concentration
6553.83 of healthy sperm
within each ejaculate
6556.62 and to really center that
around the day of ovulation.
6559.98 So what this involves
generally and what
6562.56 the typical recommendation is
is to abstain from intercourse
6567.06 with ejaculation
about two or three
6569.7 days out from ovulation
and then, on the day
6573.36 prior to ovulation and
on the day of ovulation,
6577.32 to essentially
introduce as much semen
6580.95 and ejaculate into the
reproductive pathway
6583.23 of the female as possible.
6585.97 Now, that's the
general recommendation
6587.73 that the OB/GYNs and the
urologists that I spoke to
6590.79 gave.
6591.63 But you will also hear
a different strategy.
6594.12 It's only slightly different.
6595.44 But the different
strategy involves
6597.6 trying to maximize the
concentration of healthy sperm
6600.857 within each ejaculate with
the understanding that,
6602.94 with each subsequent ejaculation
over about a 24-hour period,
6606.9 that there's going to
be a dramatic reduction
6609.25 in the concentration of sperm.
6610.5 What that means is that
if a couple, for instance,
6612.63 were to have intercourse
with ejaculation many times
6615.75 on the day prior
to ovulation, yes,
6617.55 that will introduce
a lot of sperm
6619.83 into the reproductive pathway
of the female, but what it means
6623.97 is that, on the day of
ovulation if they were
6625.86 to have intercourse, the
number of high quality sperm
6629.13 that will be available to the
egg will be greatly diminished.
6632.73 And if none of the sperm
that were introduced
6635.28 in the day prior managed
to fertilize that egg,
6638.4 well, then essentially
chances are off
6640.74 that there will be fertilization
or they're greatly diminished.
6643.62 Rather, if they're having
intercourse with ejaculation
6647.55 once or twice on the
day prior to ovulation
6650.29 and then a maximal number
of times with ejaculation
6653.91 on the day of
ovulation, that itself
6656.31 can maximize the probability
of fertilization.
6658.72 So which strategy is optimal?
6660.09 Should couples have
as much intercourse
6661.83 with ejaculation on the
day prior to ovulation
6664.66 and on the day of ovulation?
6666.36 Or should they have intercourse
on the day prior to ovulation
6670.53 but not so frequently that it
diminishes the concentration
6673.86 of sperm and then
allows for intercourse
6677.34 with the maximum
number of ejaculations
6680.01 on the day of ovulation?
6681.57 You really hear it both ways.
6683.04 And what this really
boils down to is,
6684.72 frankly, that nobody knows.
6686.4 And the reason nobody
knows is that there's
6688.35 tremendous variation
among males in terms
6690.18 of the absolute concentration
of sperm per milliliter
6693.93 of ejaculate and the amount
of sperm per milliliter
6699.51 of ejaculate within
a given time frame.
6701.92 But what everyone agrees on
is that a period of abstinence
6705.84 ranging from 48 to 72 hours
prior to an ejaculation
6709.86 increases the concentration
of high-quality sperm
6712.83 within that first ejaculation
to occur after the abstinence
6716.46 period.
6717.91 So again, to reiterate, if one's
goal is to fertilize the egg,
6720.852 you want to take
into consideration
6722.31 that most often
there is going to be
6725.61 a dramatic decline in the
concentration of sperm
6728.79 per ejaculate any time those
ejaculations are occurring
6732.162 within a short
period of time, say,
6733.62 within 12 to 24
hours of one another.
6736.36 Now, all of this,
of course, also
6738.39 relates to the female
biology and the extent
6741.87 to which the woman can
precisely identify the day
6745.29 and timing of her ovulation.
6746.85 Some women feel as if and
indeed are very accurate
6750.93 at estimating their
time of ovulation
6753.54 to within a couple of
hours or some women even
6756.15 report being able to feel
their actual ovulation,
6759.225 whether or not they are
feeling the ovulation
6761.1 itself, the deployment of
the egg or not, isn't clear.
6763.947 I certainly wouldn't know.
6765.03 I've never produced eggs,
nor have I ovulated,
6767.782 and I'm certainly not
going to contest the idea
6769.74 that women can do that.
6772.405 I mean, it makes
sense that some people
6774.03 have a very keen
so-called interoceptive
6777.54 awareness, an awareness
of the sensory events
6779.7 within their body.
6781.2 And while, of course,
the ovaries are not
6783.72 thought of as an
organ that we want
6785.43 to be able to sense what's going
on in there in terms of feel,
6788.49 there are sensory
endings within the ovary.
6790.59 And so the notion that one
could literally sense changes
6794.497 within their ovary, including
the deployment of the egg,
6796.83 is not outside the bounds
of reason and, in fact,
6800.64 could likely be the case.
6801.9 Now, that said, there are
a number of different ways
6805.027 that women will track
their ovulation.
6806.61 One is the temperature method.
6808.15 So they'll actually measure
intravaginal temperature.
6810.66 They're looking for
changes in temperature
6812.41 that are consistent around
the time of ovulation.
6815.11 We're going to have an expert
guest on, an OB/GYN, who
6818.02 can tell us a lot more about
the details and nuances
6820.927 of the temperature method.
6822.01 You'll see a lot of
information about this online,
6823.88 but there's a lot of
misunderstanding about it,
6825.838 as well.
6826.57 Other women will use apps
that take into account
6829.3 either the temperature
information
6830.89 if they're acquiring
temperature information--
6833.565 that'll be entered
into the app--
6834.94 as well as marking the
onset of menstruation,
6838.9 the onset of
bleeding, therefore,
6840.37 the start of the
ovulatory cycle,
6841.87 because, of course, as
we mentioned earlier,
6843.13 that marks day one
of their cycle.
6844.9 And then, again
and again, you can
6846.55 see how regularity
of cycle duration
6848.95 or relative regularity
of cycle duration
6851.68 really favors this whole
process of being able to predict
6854.08 when one ovulates.
6856.15 And fortunately, if the
goal is fertilization,
6860.32 there are some margins for error
that are introduced by the fact
6864.19 that the sperm can survive
within the female reproductive
6867.43 tract for some period of
days, thereby reducing
6871.3 the need for absolute certainty
about the time of ovulation
6875.17 and so on.
6876.05 In fact, it's pretty well
known that around the time
6878.77 of ovulation a couple
of things happen.
6880.712 Earlier, we talked
about one thing,
6882.17 which is there's an increase in
libido just prior to ovulation.
6884.92 This relates to, in
part, an increase
6887.83 in some of the androgens,
things like DHEA,
6891.25 but also testosterone and
some related androgens
6894.73 that can increase libido both
in males and females and changes
6900.94 to the reproductive pathway,
the female in particular,
6904.21 a change in the pH-- that
is, the relative acidity
6907.48 versus basic nature of the
mucosal lining near the cervix
6912.25 and also vaginal
secretions, such that,
6914.74 around the time of ovulation,
the entire milieu of the vagina
6919.75 and the cervix and the locations
in which fertilization can
6923.32 occur and certainly in
which the sperm are swimming
6925.78 towards the opportunity
for fertilization
6927.79 is shifted to support
sperm motility and health.
6931.16 In other words, one of the
best environments for sperm
6933.43 to survive is going to be within
the female reproductive pathway
6937.51 itself.
6938.2 And as long as we're talking
about vaginal secretions
6940.69 and mucus, it's
important to point out
6943.09 that a number of commercially
available lubricants
6945.97 can actually be detrimental
for sperm health,
6948.56 even if they don't
contain spermicide.
6950.908 So this is something
that you'll want
6952.45 to discuss with your OB/GYN
or, certainly if you're male,
6956.89 you could also discuss
this with your urologist
6958.96 and your partner's OB/GYN.
6961.72 A lot of the commercially
available lubricants
6964.15 contain chemicals that,
while they may favorably
6967.42 change the consistency
or the viscosity
6970.24 of the vaginal pathway for
purposes of intercourse,
6973.84 certainly may not be the most
favorable for maintaining
6977.83 the health of the sperm and
the motility of the sperm.
6980.08 So again, here we're talking
about intercourse only
6983.62 in the context of trying
to maximize fertilization.
6986.29 And I should mention
that there are
6988.42 certain lubricants that are
more conducive to the sperm
6990.82 environment.
6991.54 But it's something
that you'll really
6993.082 want to talk to
your OB/GYN about
6994.81 or at least read up
about if your interest is
6997.54 in trying to fertilize
and develop an embryo.
7000.1 So we covered the
optimal strategies
7001.8 for how often couples
should have intercourse
7004.8 with ejaculation around
the time of ovulation
7008.1 in order to maximize
the probability
7010.41 that successful fertilization
and ultimately pregnancy will
7013.44 occur.
7014.46 What we haven't
covered yet, however,
7016.44 is how long couples should apply
that method over time in order
7021.81 to achieve successful
fertilization in pregnancy.
7024.33 Now, of course, if
a couple decides
7026.07 that they want to
conceive and they
7027.63 apply that method or any
other method, for instance,
7030.93 and they achieve fertilization
and a successful pregnancy
7034.87 the very first
month that they try,
7036.63 well, then there's
no other work to do,
7038.52 at least until that
child is born and if
7040.747 and only if they decide they
want to have more children.
7043.08 However, many couples
find that they do not
7046.74 conceive in the first
month of trying,
7048.96 even when they apply
the optimal methods
7050.97 and even if their age and every
other factor related to egg
7054.3 quality and sperm
quality is optimized.
7056.67 Now, I think it's
the rare instance
7058.68 in which egg quality and
sperm quality are optimized.
7061.98 In fact, the word "optimal" and
"optimization" and "optimized"
7064.878 is a little bit
misleading in general
7066.42 because no one really
knows what that is.
7068.25 But of course,
there is an ideal.
7069.93 There's a perfect
standard to which
7072.09 everyone would like to achieve.
7073.56 But of course, we all enter the
picture with genetic variables,
7076.98 environmental variables,
and so forth, many of which
7080.07 we'll talk about because you
can, in fact, adjust them
7082.328 in the direction that you would
like to improve sperm and egg
7084.87 quality.
7085.68 But most people simply
will not succeed
7089.64 in achieving a successful
fertilization the first month
7093.48 that they try.
7094.38 Now, there is a
truth that governs
7096.99 how many tries it
ought to take in order
7100.17 to achieve successful
fertilization and ultimately
7103.11 pregnancy.
7103.74 And it's very age dependent.
7105.33 And in particular, it's
dependent on the age
7107.55 of the mother, because the
age and quality of the egg,
7110.49 while it's not the only
factor, is certainly
7113.99 one of the most determining
factors in whether or not
7116.45 successful fertilization occurs.
7118.28 And as women age, the
quality of the eggs
7120.8 tends to diminish
over time, largely
7122.9 due to changes in the
mitochondrial function
7124.97 and the spindle that pulls
the chromosomes apart,
7127.52 although there could be other
factors involved as well.
7130.26 Now, before continuing
any further,
7131.88 I just want to acknowledge that
this whole language around egg
7134.69 quality and sperm quality
is not the greatest
7137.6 language because it's
entirely subjective.
7140.3 And yet the word "quality"
in these instances
7143.51 is really there to
explain a broad variety
7146.32 of factors that can,
in fact, be measured,
7148.07 things like the number of
follicles that are deployed
7150.65 each month in a woman's
ovulation or the number
7153.8 of motile sperm or the number
of morphologically-- that
7157.04 is, correctly shaped sperm
in the male and so forth.
7159.355 So when we talk about egg
quality or sperm quality,
7161.48 we're really referring to an
amalgam of different features
7165.56 related to the different
aspects of ovulation
7169.01 leading to successful
fertilization
7170.72 or the different aspects of
sperm related to whether or not
7174.02 they can arrive and
deliver their DNA contents
7176.06 and so forth.
7176.76 So I will use the words "egg
quality" and "sperm quality"
7179.27 just as general themes
because that's what
7181.04 a lot of the clinicians use.
7182.72 But I do understand that it's
a little bit of a loaded term
7185.18 in both instances, and it
doesn't relate to any one
7188.09 specific parameter, per se.
7190.52 So getting back to this
issue of how long couples
7192.77 should try according to
the age of the female
7195.41 and perhaps also
the age of the male.
7197.36 Well, most of the data
that have been collected
7199.85 relate to the age of the
female, as I mentioned before.
7202.44 And what we're
about to discuss is,
7204.655 within the scientific
literature,
7206.03 described as what's
called fecundability,
7208.52 which is the amount of time
over which a given couple needs
7212.81 to attempt to
conceive-- of course,
7214.71 by having intercourse
with ejaculation--
7216.83 around the time of ovulation.
7218.78 It assumes that all
the other things
7220.28 are being done correctly.
7222.35 And what we know is that there's
a strong age-dependent effect
7225.65 that largely rests on the
age of the egg-- that is,
7228.86 of the female.
7229.82 And what we know is that
for females 30 years old
7234.56 or younger, if they have
intercourse with ejaculation
7238.565 around the time of
ovulation, say, on the day
7240.44 before and on the
day of ovulation--
7243.14 and there could be other
intercourse with ejaculation
7245.72 around that time as well--
7247.73 on average, that will result
in a successful fertilization
7251.78 in pregnancy about
20% of the time
7254.84 on the first month
of attempting,
7256.73 the first ovulation cycle.
7258.71 Now, if fertilization and
pregnancy occurs, great.
7261.788 There'll be at least
a nine-month lag
7263.33 until they decide
whether or not they
7264.95 want to try and conceive again.
7266.51 However, most couples, even
if the woman is 30 years
7270.35 old or younger, will
not successfully
7272.51 conceive on that first attempt.
7275.0 And that's because the
probability is not 100%.
7277.55 It's 20%.
7278.42 So 80% of the time,
they simply will not
7280.82 conceive, which means that
they hopefully will try again
7284.81 the very next month.
7286.02 And if they successfully
conceive, great.
7288.253 And if they don't,
then they ought
7289.67 to try again the next month,
the next month, and so forth.
7292.11 Now, the typical advice that
an OB/GYN would give you
7295.52 is that, for a woman
30 years or younger--
7299.12 and leaving aside
the age of the father
7302.81 but still assuming that egg
quality and sperm quality
7306.95 are sufficiently high to
achieve fertilization--
7309.68 that the couple should--
7312.485 or if the woman is trying
to have kids alone,
7314.36 the woman should
attempt to conceive over
7316.82 the period of six months.
7318.59 Why?
7319.22 Well, if you think
about it, if there's
7320.845 a 20% chance in the first month
and it's unsuccessful, well,
7324.44 then on the second month,
there'll also be a 20% chance.
7327.08 On the third month,
also a 20% chance.
7329.0 What I'm describing
here is what obviously
7332.0 is independent probabilities.
7334.43 That is, if you
were to flip a coin
7336.29 and the probability of
getting heads is 50%,
7338.46 the probability of getting
tails is 50%, of course.
7341.48 You don't expect that the
previous flip had anything
7344.245 to do with the
result that you'll
7345.62 get on the subsequent flip.
7346.67 That's what independent
probabilities are.
7348.42 However, when it comes
to fecundability,
7351.86 we're really talking
about something
7353.36 which is called cumulative
pregnancy rate, which
7356.12 is not really independent
probabilities.
7358.25 Now, why would that be?
7359.31 Why would it be that if
you did not successfully
7361.31 conceive in the first
month of trying that,
7363.8 by simply trying again and
again and again, the probability
7366.53 of conceiving would increase?
7368.13 Well, the reason for that
is that this whole business
7370.43 of fertilization is
not just about what's
7372.172 happening with the egg.
7373.13 It's also about what's
happening with the sperm.
7375.2 So there are a number of
different events related
7377.84 to the biology of the egg and
the biology of the sperm, which
7380.423 you are now very familiar
with from everything
7382.34 I've talked about up until now.
7383.81 And there a bunch
of chance events,
7386.248 for instance, that the
sperm won't actually
7388.04 arrive at the egg in time
or that the egg won't arrive
7391.012 at the sperm in time,
because, of course,
7392.72 it's a bidirectional
migration of those two cell
7394.72 types, or that, for
whatever reason,
7396.74 fertilization won't occur.
7397.935 So what we're really
talking about when
7399.56 we talk about the cumulative
pregnancy rate over time
7402.83 is the fact that there are
multiple probabilities at work.
7405.86 And yes, those are somewhat
independent in the sense
7408.62 that the biology of the
sperm doesn't really strictly
7411.08 depend on the
biology of the egg,
7412.52 at least not until they
meet and fertilize.
7414.41 But the likelihood
of pregnancy depends
7418.28 on those independent
probabilities,
7419.94 which makes this a
cumulative pregnancy rate.
7422.635 Now, if any of that is
confusing, what it basically
7424.76 means is that for
the egg and the sperm
7426.71 to meet and to fertilize, a
number of different events
7429.14 that carry some intentionality--
7432.015 the sperm swims towards
the egg and so forth.
7433.89 The egg doesn't have a
personality in there,
7436.82 at least not yet.
7437.69 But it, quote, unquote,
"wants" to be fertilize.
7440.27 It is, in principle,
receptive to fertilization.
7443.42 Well, in order for
that to happen,
7445.975 there are going to be some
events related to chance
7448.1 that could limit the
ability for that to happen,
7450.188 and there'll be
other events dictated
7451.73 by the biology of those
two cell types that
7453.59 are driving that
event to happen,
7455.81 that are biasing the
event to, yes, happen.
7457.7 And so what we're
talking about when
7459.2 we talk about cumulative
pregnancy rate
7461.0 is how much of the
biology of the woman
7464.18 is skewed towards fertilization
to be likely to occur.
7468.03 So to make this very
simple, all we need to know
7470.87 is that for women 30
years old or younger,
7473.15 because the probability of
getting pregnant on any one
7477.77 attempt to conceive
is 20%, well,
7482.21 then if that doesn't
occur the first time,
7484.55 then she should simply
repeat that at least five
7486.92 and probably six times before
deciding to go to an OB/GYN
7490.58 and conclude that there's
something going on either
7492.86 with the egg or, of course,
it could be with the sperm
7495.29 because 20 times 5 is 100.
7496.873 So we're talking about
cumulative percent--
7498.665 so 20, 40, 60, 80, 100.
7501.47 And the six month
there would take you
7503.75 to 120%, which is a
different thing altogether.
7507.63 But in general,
that's why OB/GYNs
7509.547 will tell their
female patients, look,
7511.13 if you're setting
out to conceive,
7512.63 try for about five
or six months,
7514.56 and if you're not successful,
come back and see me.
7517.1 Now, for women who
are age 31 to 33,
7521.33 the probability of conceiving
in that first month
7523.49 drops to about 18%.
7525.27 So women in that age
range and their partners
7527.51 should certainly try
and conceive naturally
7529.79 over a period of six or
seven months in order
7532.49 to get to that 100%
cumulative probability.
7534.74 And then for women
who are age 34 to 37,
7537.92 the probability of conceiving
in that first month
7540.5 of trying and certainly every
month thereafter is about 11%.
7545.238 So when the age of the
woman starts extending out
7547.28 to about 34 or 35 years
old, then the typical advice
7550.76 of the OB/GYN is going to be
to attempt to conceive over
7554.06 a period of about
nine months to a year
7556.55 before deciding to take some
sort of medical intervention.
7560.75 And then, of course, as the
age of the woman increases,
7563.66 so too does the quality
of the eggs go down.
7566.51 Now, that's not true
for every woman.
7568.07 There are many women who, in
their late 30s and 40s and even
7570.86 early 50s, have successfully
conceived healthy children,
7574.37 although the probability of
that-- the likelihood of it
7577.25 drops substantially.
7578.73 So for instance, for women
who are age 38 to 39,
7581.93 the probability of a
successful conception
7584.42 by natural conception--
intercourse with ejaculation--
7587.66 is going to be about 5%.
7590.06 So it's really dropped
to a quarter of what
7592.52 it was when that woman was 30.
7595.31 Again, these are averages only.
7596.99 What does that mean?
7597.87 Well, it means that if
you are age 38 or older,
7601.01 chances are that you should
probably go to your OB/GYN
7604.67 right at the outset
of your desire
7606.29 to conceive and ask what you
can do to improve egg quality.
7609.11 Otherwise, if you were
to extend the math out,
7611.68 we know that if you're age
30 or younger, 20% chance
7614.67 in any one given month.
7615.91 That means about four
to six months of trying.
7617.97 Well, you can simply multiply
that times four or five
7622.02 for someone in their
late 30s or early 40s.
7624.685 And so what you're
really talking about
7626.31 is several years of trying.
7627.57 And of course, what's happening
during those several years?
7629.61 The woman is getting older.
7630.99 And as a consequence,
the quality of the eggs
7632.94 is declining even further.
7634.9 So if you are 35, 36
years old, it might not
7639.45 be entirely unreasonable to
talk to your OB/GYN right
7642.03 at the outset of
desiring to conceive,
7644.132 but you could also
just take the approach
7645.84 of trying to conceive naturally
for about a year or a year
7648.3 and a half before deciding
to do that, keeping in mind
7651.33 that all the while
you can't stop time.
7653.31 So biological time and aging is
going to occur in the backdrop.
7656.79 But hopefully this description
of cumulative pregnancy rate
7660.45 makes sense.
7661.2 Again, the idea is
that while it's true
7663.87 that every single month
there's an independent chance
7667.08 of the woman getting pregnant
and that chance is dropping
7671.37 from abut 20% at age 30 over
time to about, really, 1% to 3%
7676.08 for women 40 or
older, there's also
7678.33 this notion of cumulative
probability, which
7680.73 involves multiple
biological events in both
7683.13 the egg and the sperm that have
to converge in time and space
7686.4 in order for successful
fertilization to occur.
7688.92 As long as we're
on this topic, I
7690.35 think it's only fair to address
the issue of miscarriage.
7693.6 And miscarriages can arise
from a variety of sources.
7696.36 They can arise from
genetic defects.
7698.46 They can arise from issues in
the milieu view of the uterus.
7701.64 They can arise from issues with
the sperm, for that matter.
7704.67 We really don't want to
put all the weight and all
7707.16 the responsibility on the egg.
7709.36 This is always an
egg/sperm dynamic.
7711.33 And when I say
egg/sperm dynamic, now
7713.19 hopefully that calls to mind
the huge library of information
7715.89 that we've been
covering up until now
7717.432 about chromosomal segregation
and the coming together
7719.97 of these different cell types
and their genetic information.
7722.67 Any number of different
steps within the process
7725.22 of fertilization
leading up to pregnancy
7727.32 can lead to miscarriage.
7729.33 However, the probability
of miscarriage
7732.66 greatly increases as a
function of the age of the egg.
7737.4 And the basic numbers
on thisare are
7740.25 that for women who are 35
years or older, about 25%
7745.92 of successful fertilizations
lead to miscarriages.
7749.22 Now, when those miscarriages
occur during pregnancy
7752.04 can be highly variable.
7753.3 Sometimes it's within
the first trimester.
7755.19 Sometimes it could be later.
7757.36 But the probability
is about 25%.
7760.32 That probability increases
greatly over time,
7764.2 such that by the time women
are in their early 40s--
7767.22 so 40 or older--
7768.43 the probability of
miscarriage after
7770.19 a successful fertilization
is going to be about 50%.
7773.52 And this could be due
to a number of factors,
7775.8 as I mentioned before.
7776.79 But one common reason
is that there can
7779.7 be chromosomal abnormalities.
7781.32 And that could be
related typically
7783.45 to the segregation
of the egg when
7786.72 half of the
chromosomes in that egg
7788.22 are removed, taking it
from diploid to haploid.
7790.62 If you recall, there's
that little polar body,
7793.21 which is the removal of
the chromosomes that's
7796.29 ejected from the egg that
will eventually ovulate.
7798.48 And sometimes not
all the chromosomes
7800.46 that were supposed to be ejected
in that polar body are ejected.
7804.54 And as a consequence, there
are multiple chromosomes
7806.79 or duplications of chromosomes,
things like trisomies.
7809.37 Sometimes too many
chromosomes move away
7811.422 and there are actually
removal of entire chromosomes,
7813.63 meaning both strands, so that
you have chromosomal deletions.
7816.6 And in that case, typically
fertilization won't occur.
7819.473 But there are instances in
which fertilization will occur.
7821.89 So a woman will get a
positive pregnancy test.
7823.89 Her periods will stop.
7825.39 And the couple will
think that they're
7827.43 advancing along the steps
to a successful pregnancy,
7831.19 and then there will be,
sadly, a miscarriage.
7833.67 Many, many times
those miscarriages
7835.95 are the consequence
of the fact that,
7837.99 when there are extra
chromosomes there or there
7840.93 are too few chromosomes present,
that embryogenesis can simply
7846.12 not progress in a healthy way.
7848.43 There are some
instances in which
7850.62 all of the chromosomes and all
the chromosomal arrangements
7853.14 are perfectly normal and
miscarriages can still occur.
7857.08 I'm going to do a future
episode about pregnancy
7860.1 and embryonic
development where we
7861.69 will get into this more deeply.
7863.14 But just understand that the
frequency of miscarriages
7866.37 increases dramatically
after about age 34
7870.06 and then continues to
increase dramatically,
7872.82 extending well
out until the 40s.
7875.01 Now, a very important
consideration
7876.96 in terms of understanding
and predicting
7878.94 fertility and fecundability,
this word that describes
7882.33 the probability of getting
pregnant on a given try
7884.85 and over time, is
trying to address how,
7889.41 quote, unquote,
"fertile" a woman is
7891.99 and, importantly, how, quote,
unquote, "fertile" a male is.
7896.04 And we'll talk about the
male side in a moment.
7898.48 But when trying to address how
fertile a woman is, of course,
7902.07 age is going to be one of the
major factors, but just one
7905.97 factor.
7906.94 We already talked about
how age determines
7908.7 the likelihood of a
successful pregnancy
7911.23 if the intercourse and
ejaculation is being carried
7915.33 out at the correct times
and with viable sperm
7918.63 capable of fertilizing eggs.
7920.7 And then, of course, there's
the issue of egg quality.
7923.1 But in general, most
women would like
7925.38 to know how fertile they are
as a function of their age.
7930.09 And I actually think this is
one of the most important topics
7933.03 in this whole space
around fertility
7934.8 that isn't often discussed or
at least isn't often discussed
7937.56 until women are in
their late 30s or 40s,
7940.74 when oftentimes
they will look back
7943.012 and wish that either they
had frozen their eggs
7944.97 or they had frozen fertilized
embryos, which is a whole thing
7948.6 unto itself.
7949.223 And we can talk
about that when we
7950.64 have an episode on in-vitro
fertilization in more depth.
7954.0 But there is a fairly
straightforward way
7957.24 or set of ways that
women can determine
7959.88 their basic level of fertility.
7962.67 Leaving aside a lot
of the detailed issues
7964.8 about the quality of eggs
and so forth, one thing
7967.56 that you already learned
is that there's this vault,
7969.78 there's this reserve that
we call the ovarian reserve,
7972.42 and that each month a
certain number of follicles
7975.57 leave that reserve, and
there's the opportunity, based
7979.8 on the ovulation of a single
egg, to fertilize that egg
7983.7 and for the woman
to get pregnant.
7985.29 Now, one thing that
we know for sure
7986.91 is that the size of
the population that's
7990.45 released from that
vault each month
7993.33 has a very strong
positive correlation
7996.36 with the size of the
reserve in the vault itself.
7999.85 So the way to think
about this, perhaps,
8002.48 is that the vault is
like a bank account.
8004.58 It has a certain
amount of money--
8006.9 in this case, eggs-- in it.
8008.3 And you could imagine, if
someone's reasonably logical,
8012.05 that if they have more money
in their bank account, then
8014.42 they're going to
withdraw a larger amount
8016.718 each month than if they have
a small amount each month,
8019.01 if the idea is to make
that vault, that bank,
8022.37 of eggs available to them over
the longest period of time.
8026.87 And indeed, biology
is pretty smart.
8028.86 It doesn't deploy or release
half the follicles in one month
8033.35 and then just slowly trickle
out the remainder of follicles.
8035.903 No, that's not how it works.
8037.07 What you find is that, of
course, in younger women--
8039.86 so, say, in their late
teens, 20s, and 30s--
8043.91 the ovarian reserve
in the vault is
8045.89 going to have more eggs
in it, and the number
8048.56 of follicles and eggs that
leave that vault each month
8051.26 is going to be quite high.
8052.65 So one way to evaluate
how, quote, unquote,
8056.21 "fertile" you are--
8057.71 again, just one way--
is to go to your OB/GYN
8060.89 and say that you would like
to know how many follicles
8063.32 you have in a given month.
8064.507 And of course, they'll
look at them on both sides,
8066.59 in both ovaries.
8068.03 And for instance, if a woman
has just two or three follicles
8072.95 that are out each month, well,
then the assumption-- again,
8076.323 it's just an assumption-- but
the assumption that's pretty
8078.74 good-- because there is this
positive correlation that
8081.5 generally occurs--
8082.4 is that that ovarian reserve--
8084.95 that the number of
eggs in the vault
8086.81 is fairly low
compared to someone
8089.09 who, say, has 20 follicles
or 30 follicles each month.
8093.2 And that's the typical trend.
8094.49 Again, these are averages.
8095.7 And it's very important to not
get attached to any one number
8098.33 here.
8098.83 Again, these are averages.
8100.17 So for instance, there are women
who only deploy five follicles
8105.23 and eggs each month out
of their ovarian vault
8107.81 but who find themselves
to be very fertile.
8109.8 And there could be a
number of different factors
8111.8 to explain that.
8112.49 Other women will
have 20 or 30 eggs
8115.13 and follicles that leave that
vault, the ovarian reserve,
8117.71 each month.
8118.263 And they will have a
harder time getting
8119.93 pregnant for any number
of different reasons.
8121.805 But in general, the
more eggs and follicles
8123.98 that leave the vault each
month, the higher number
8127.28 of eggs that are still in
reserve, meaning the greater
8129.95 amount of time over which
a given woman could still
8132.65 attempt to have
successful fertilizations.
8135.9 Now, this small collection
of follicles and eggs
8139.138 that are released each
month actually has a name.
8141.18 They're called antral follicles.
8142.4 These are small follicles.
8143.483 They tend to be about 2
to 9 millimeters across.
8145.73 The way these are
analyzed or measured
8147.74 is woman will go into the OB/GYN
office, and by ultrasound--
8152.03 typically there's
some local anesthesia,
8153.71 but it's not often a
general anesthesia,
8155.9 but by local anesthesia or
sometimes no anesthesia--
8158.99 they will essentially count
the number of follicles that
8162.11 are present in each side,
on ovary on the left
8165.05 and the ovary on the right, and
give a woman some sense of how
8168.77 many follicles she has.
8169.94 And typically this is done
over a series of months
8172.28 to determine how many eggs
are leaving the ovarian
8175.49 reserve each month and
therefore how many eggs
8177.89 she is likely to still have
in the ovarian reserve.
8181.49 now there's a noninvasive
way to do this, as well.
8184.13 Although, typically, an OB/GYN
will do both what I just
8187.37 described with ultrasound and
measure something called AMH,
8190.67 which is anti-Müllerian hormone,
which is a hormone that is
8194.209 released by that antral
follicle population,
8197.12 the population of follicles
and eggs that leave the ovarian
8200.48 reserve each month.
8201.35 So one is a blood draw
measure of a hormone, AMH.
8204.5 The other is a structural
imaging measure
8206.75 of the antral
follicles directly.
8209.389 again the typical trend is for
the number of antral follicles
8213.03 to decline over time.
8214.6 So one might expect,
for instance,
8216.48 that a woman in her 20s or
30s might have 20, 30, maybe
8220.29 even 40 antral
follicles that are
8222.478 exiting the reserve each month.
8223.77 And again, that's the
total across both ovaries.
8227.1 Again, these are just averages.
8228.52 These are going to
be distributions.
8229.62 There will be people
with far fewer.
8230.85 There will be people
with far more.
8232.308 But that over time, regardless
of where a woman starts out,
8238.139 from one decade to the
next half decade and decade
8241.24 and so on, that the number of
antral follicles will decline
8244.469 and the amount of or the levels
of AMH will also decline.
8248.77 So what does this all mean?
8250.629 What this means
is that if you are
8252.36 a woman who is in her 20s or
30s or 40s, whatever your age,
8257.73 if you are interested in
conceiving in the future,
8260.29 it's very likely a good
idea to go to your OB/GYN
8264.6 and get either your AMH levels
measured or your follicle count
8268.86 measured and to do that several
times in a given period.
8272.01 And I don't mean a
menstrual period.
8273.51 I mean given a period of
time across several months
8275.78 to determine what is the average
number of follicles, what's
8278.28 your average AMH level,
thereby giving you
8282.24 some window into how many
eggs you are likely to still
8285.99 have in your ovarian reserve.
8287.37 I cannot tell you how many women
that I've spoken to and how
8290.1 many OB/GYNs--
8290.7 more importantly,
because they speak
8292.2 to many more women about this
than I ever have or ever will--
8296.01 wish that they had
done this earlier.
8298.75 They think, oh,
well, I'm in my 20s,
8300.33 so I'm likely to have
a ton of follicles,
8302.038 or they got pregnant
once before,
8303.413 and so they're not so concerned
about the number of follicles
8305.955 or their AMH levels.
8307.02 But over and over
again, I was told
8309.45 in researching for this
episode that the earlier
8312.27 and more frequent that women
do this procedure of measuring
8315.51 AMH and measuring
their follicle count,
8318.45 the higher the probability
that they will eventually
8320.73 have a successful
fertilization and pregnancy
8322.83 when they seek to do so.
8324.36 Now, the mirror image of all
this, of course, is the sperm.
8327.78 And there's a kind of
common misconception
8330.299 out there that, you know,
the sperm, you only need one.
8333.7 And indeed you only need one.
8334.92 But actually, you
need many, and it's
8337.41 only one that's able to
successfully fertilize the egg.
8341.25 So this whole
concept of you only
8342.84 need one is both
dismissive of the sperm
8345.66 but more importantly
dismissive of the biology
8347.61 of the sperm and the egg.
8349.86 It only takes one successful
sperm and one successful egg,
8353.653 but that's sort of
like telling a woman,
8355.32 hey, you only need one egg.
8357.299 You need one egg of sufficient
quality in the right time
8361.26 and place, and
you need one sperm
8363.69 of sufficient quality in
the right time and place
8366.24 in order to get successful
fertilization and hopefully
8368.58 pregnancy.
8369.93 But you need a lot
of sperm in order
8374.219 to get a high probability
that that one sperm will
8378.209 be able to successfully
fertilize the egg.
8380.379 So we have this image of
sperm as these dumb operators
8383.25 that just sort of swim
mindlessly towards anything.
8386.603 And if they bump into an egg,
then they fertilize the egg.
8389.02 And that's really
not the way it works.
8390.78 As I talked about
earlier, the sperm--
8392.58 with its head, its
mid region, its tail,
8394.47 chock a block with mitochondria
in the mid region--
8397.2 is really an active motile
cell that indeed will just
8401.19 swim forward, if it's a healthy,
forward progressing sperm.
8404.34 But many males out
there just simply
8407.19 do not have any knowledge
of how many quality
8410.04 sperm that they happen to have.
8411.63 Now, given the fact
that sperm analysis
8413.49 is relatively inexpensive and
also the fact that freezing
8417.27 sperm is relatively
inexpensive, I
8419.6 think it stands to reason that
most men should at least get
8422.43 some window into the number
and quality of their sperm.
8425.747 Now, it's a fair assumption
to say that if someone
8427.83 is in their late teens
or early 20s or 30s
8431.67 that they probably have
high-quality sperm.
8433.62 But again, as with the
egg and the importance
8436.44 of measuring AMH and
follicle count across time,
8439.8 men should really evaluate
the quality and number
8442.205 of their sperm.
8442.83 And we talked a
little bit earlier
8444.247 about some of the parameters
that urologists and OB/GYNs
8447.84 like to see when
evaluating sperm.
8450.84 There's a minimum number
or concentration of sperm
8453.96 that they'd like to see if
a couple is going to use
8456.33 IVF, in-vitro fertilization.
8458.07 And typically that's going
to be about 15 to 20 million
8460.5 per mil of sperm or semen.
8463.68 And typically they want to
see somewhere between 2 and 5
8466.86 milliliters of semen,
overall, in a given
8469.86 ejaculate after a 72 to 48 hour
abstinence period, because,
8474.12 of course, the
more ejaculations,
8475.92 the smaller the volume
of the ejaculate
8479.52 in a short period of time.
8481.09 But after 48 to 72
hours, you more or less
8484.08 maximize the volume
of ejaculate.
8486.3 And then, of course, they
want to see 50% but typically
8489.27 60% or more of motile
sperm in order to get IVF,
8492.73 but more is better.
8493.79 And of course, there
is an enormous range,
8495.54 as I mentioned before.
8496.457 Some males will have anywhere
from 10 to 20 million sperm
8501.15 per milliliter of
ejaculate, and some men
8504.48 will have 100 to 200 million.
8507.495 But just because they
have 100 to 200 million
8509.37 doesn't mean that all of those
sperm are of high quality
8511.832 and can fertilize eggs.
8512.79 Sometimes more than
half will be twitchers,
8515.7 and some will be immotile,
and so on and so forth.
8517.81 So it's very
straightforward what
8519.883 I believe most people
should do and what
8521.55 the urologists I spoke to
in advance of this episode
8525.03 said to do, which is to
simply do a sperm analysis.
8527.82 Refrain from ejaculation
for 48 to 72 hours.
8531.09 Give a sperm sample.
8532.89 Have that sperm sample analyzed.
8534.63 The cost of the sperm analysis
is not typically that much.
8539.04 And considering that conception
and healthy conception
8542.64 and fertilization is
an expensive process
8544.8 if you have to go the
in-vitro fertilization route,
8547.5 it stands to reason that the
cost is pretty well justified.
8550.08 You also have the option
to freeze sperm over time.
8552.66 There is evidence that
the age of the father
8555.33 and therefore the
age of the sperm
8557.55 can dictate whether
or not there's
8559.23 a higher incidence of
problematic pregnancy
8562.8 or developmental outcomes,
including autism.
8565.38 That is true.
8566.708 You've probably heard
that if the father is
8568.5 40 years or older, the
incidence of autism
8571.53 is increased significantly.
8572.85 That is true.
8573.69 Although the overall probability
of having an autistic offspring
8578.88 if somebody-- if the father,
that is-- is 40 years or older
8581.76 is still quite a bit lower
than you would imagine.
8584.88 It's not as if the probability
suddenly skyrockets.
8588.49 So we'll have an
episode on autism
8590.4 and genetic and
non-genetic influences
8593.85 on autism and other aspects
of the autism spectrum.
8596.91 But the point is this.
8599.7 I believe and the
urologists I spoke
8602.04 to who are interested in
fertility and male health
8604.8 and sexual health
suggest that men
8606.93 get their sperm analyzed
at least once every five
8611.01 years and certainly,
if they're going
8613.35 to want to conceive children
in the distant future,
8616.05 that they consider freezing
their sperm because that, too,
8618.69 is fairly nominal cost in order
to freeze sperm at a younger
8621.85 age.
8622.35 And of course, if you
can freeze and use sperm
8624.54 from the time in which you
were younger, why wouldn't you,
8627.22 right?
8627.72 I mean, you can still opt
to go for natural pregnancy
8630.36 later if that's
what you want to do.
8631.89 But having that in reserve
is generally a good idea.
8635.31 And I discussed some of the
parameters that are looked for.
8638.01 And perhaps most
importantly, there
8640.71 is the possibility of an
underlying issue whereby,
8643.47 for instance, there is very
little sperm in an ejaculate.
8649.02 As I mentioned earlier, the
seminal fluid in the ejaculate
8651.78 could have zero sperm in it,
but the volume of ejaculate
8654.54 could appear completely normal.
8656.08 So just because your ejaculate
volume is normal to you
8659.4 or is in that range
of 2 to 5 milliliters,
8662.772 well, then that
doesn't necessarily
8664.23 mean that there
are any sperm there
8665.688 or that there are very few sperm
there and the few sperm that
8670.08 are there or the many sperm that
there are functionally motile.
8673.12 So get this analyzed.
8674.25 It's really worth doing.
8675.257 And again, it's not something
you have to do every year.
8677.59 It's something that you want to
do probably every five years,
8680.37 at least until the
point where you've
8681.48 conceived as many children
as you ever want to conceive.
8683.813 So the basic takeaway here
is that, if you're a woman,
8686.37 to get your egg count--
your antral follicle count,
8689.94 that is--
8690.78 and therefore your reserve
of eggs, indirectly measured,
8694.95 and of course also get
your AMH levels measured,
8697.59 and if you're a male to
have a sperm analysis
8699.72 and to do that relatively early.
8701.1 In fact, another
incentive for doing
8702.6 that early is that
you have a comparison
8704.267 point so that, for instance,
if you are in your early 20s
8706.78 and you're not thinking
about having kids at all
8708.78 or you're thinking that
you might someday have kids
8710.37 but it's a really someday,
someday, far off in the future,
8713.28 well, it's wonderful to have
a reference point from which
8716.28 to compare your biology
in your early 20s
8719.46 to your biology in your
mid or late 30s or 40s when
8722.49 you might happen to be
interested in conceiving.
8725.34 And if that doesn't
provide incentive enough,
8728.55 I should mention-- and this
is important to point out
8730.95 and that I think both
males and females are not
8734.1 aware of-- is that one in
five couples that have issues
8738.03 with fertility,
the issue ends up
8741.15 falling on the biology that
is the quality of the sperm
8744.72 or a lack of number of sperm.
8746.83 So I think there's a
misconception that when
8749.55 fertility is an issue it's
always an issue with the eggs
8752.74 and this age-dependent decline
in the egg quality-- again,
8756.507 it's the best language we have
available to us at the moment--
8759.09 this age-dependent decline in
egg quality is often to blame,
8762.63 but not always.
8763.56 One in five couples that
have challenges conceiving it
8766.147 turns out that it's going to
be an issue with the sperm.
8768.48 And of course, there are a
number of different sperm
8769.92 analyses that, should all
the other parameters of sperm
8772.86 appear normal,
now, for instance,
8774.87 you can get a DNA
fragmentation analysis.
8777.472 You can see whether or
not the DNA of the sperm
8779.43 are somehow disrupted.
8780.99 Urologists these days are
excellent at figuring out,
8784.53 for instance, if a male
has lots and lots of sperm,
8787.23 everything looks great, but the
shape of the head of the sperm
8790.2 isn't quite right-- if
it's not oval enough
8792.24 and it's too rounded, that could
be a genetic defect under which
8795.69 conditions there is zero
probability of the male ever
8801.15 naturally conceiving, regardless
of who the female partner is.
8804.78 Believe it or not, males
can have a ton of sperm,
8807.12 but if they carry a
certain genetic defect,
8809.4 those sperm will be incapable
of depositing those 23
8812.94 chromosomes into the egg.
8815.08 However, there are ways
in which that sperm can
8818.4 be coaxed or forced
to fertilize the egg
8821.16 and deposit its genetic contents
by in-vitro fertilization
8823.71 and then implantation
into the female.
8825.37 So again, lots of
reasons to have a egg
8828.54 reserve analysis by
ultrasound and AMH
8830.85 for females and lots
of reasons for males
8833.46 to have a sperm analysis.
8834.87 And of course, typically
with a sperm analysis
8837.09 and a ovarian reserve analysis
will be a hormone analysis.
8842.72 And I'm a very strong believer
in people getting an insight--
8846.53 that is, a window--
8847.4 into their hormonal
composition, not just
8850.25 when they encounter
problems but starting
8852.98 at a pretty early age, even if
it's only done once every five
8855.59 years or so, having a
reference point to your 20s
8858.77 and to your 30s and mid-30s for
when you felt a certain way.
8861.65 Maybe, as in the case
for many people I know,
8864.2 they actually feel
better in their 40s
8865.88 than they did in their
20s because they're
8867.17 doing a lot of things
to support their health.
8868.76 That is possible.
8869.76 But in many cases,
people start feeling
8871.76 not as well or their fertility
seems to be dropping off
8875.103 or any number of different
parameters that we've discussed
8877.52 today were related to
vitality and longevity seem
8880.1 to be dropping off
over time, and they
8881.96 want to get a insight into
what could be the issue.
8884.745 And hormones are
sometimes, not always,
8886.37 but sometimes involved in
those underlying issues.
8889.2 And there is nothing as valuable
as having a reference point
8893.21 from a time in which
things were going well
8895.49 to evaluate the, for
instance, levels of hormones,
8898.85 not just testosterone but
also estrogen and progesterone
8901.92 and so forth.
8902.85 So you need a comparison
point in order
8904.55 to determine what really
needs to be changed.
8906.57 So all of this is a strong
push for people to use
8910.058 your insurance, if you're
able to put it on insurance--
8912.35 oftentimes people are--
8914.39 and if not, to try and find a
reasonable or reasonably priced
8918.92 way to do a sperm
and egg analysis
8922.34 and to ideally do a
hormone analysis as well.
8925.38 It's really going to set you
up for the maximum probability
8927.86 of being able to conceive
children when you want to
8929.985 and also to avoid a bunch of
other health-related issues
8932.96 that involve hormones
and reproductive health
8936.35 and, in general, to support
your mental health and physical
8939.29 health.
8939.805 So I've been talking about
a bunch of things to do.
8941.93 There are a couple of things to
be mindful of to actively avoid
8945.47 if your goal is to be
and remain fertile.
8948.41 And that's regardless
of whether or not
8950.3 you want to conceive children
in the future or not.
8953.24 Now, in the context
of this discussion,
8955.04 the same things that
we've heard to be
8956.75 true for other
aspects of our health
8958.43 turn out to also be true.
8960.06 So let's just start
with the basics.
8962.66 Everybody should be getting
approximately six to eight
8966.43 hours of sleep every night.
8967.64 That should be quality sleep.
8969.11 Optimizing your sleep is
fundamental to balancing
8971.977 your hormones.
8972.56 Now, balancing your
hormones is kind
8974.06 of a catch phrase for all
things related to proper hormone
8976.52 regulation.
8978.05 Sleep is the fundamental
layer of mental health,
8980.19 physical health, and
performance of all kinds
8982.61 and, believe it
or not, fertility.
8984.68 When people are not
sleeping well or enough,
8987.35 stress hormones, in
particular cortisol,
8989.51 shift to peaking
later in the day,
8991.67 and those elevated cortisol
levels later in the day
8994.13 cause a bunch of
different problems
8996.41 in both males and females,
many of which impact fertility.
8999.11 So controlling cortisol starts
with controlling your sleep.
9003.08 It also impacts testosterone
and estrogen levels.
9006.89 So of course, the proper ratios
of testosterone and estrogen
9009.4 will vary from males to females.
9011.3 But in order to get
those right or as right
9013.48 as they can be without
other interventions,
9015.473 you want to make sure you're
getting enough quality sleep.
9017.89 How much sleep?
9018.61 Most people need about six to
eight hours of sleep per night.
9021.58 Waking up once,
maybe twice per night
9023.277 in the middle of the night
and going back to sleep
9025.36 is not such a big deal, but six
to eight hours of solid sleep
9028.15 would be ideal.
9028.788 Some people need a
little bit less in order
9030.58 to function-- five hours.
9032.152 Some people need
a little bit more.
9033.61 Developing teenagers and babies
and kids need a lot more.
9036.125 People who are sick or
recovering from injury
9038.0 need a lot more.
9038.74 We've done multiple
episodes on sleep.
9040.99 We have a toolkit for
sleep available free
9043.09 at hubermanlab.com.
9044.378 You go there.
9044.92 You don't even have to
sign up for the newsletter,
9046.78 although you can if you want.
9047.988 Just go to a Toolkit for
Sleep under the menu,
9050.23 and you'll be able
to download that,
9052.0 or you can even just
view it on the screen
9053.21 if you don't want
to download it.
9054.1 It has lots of tools.
9054.975 We've done an episode
called "Perfect Your Sleep"
9058.03 that has a lot of tools.
9060.067 They're all timestamped for you.
9061.4 We've done a "Master Your
Sleep" episode, so lots of tools
9063.52 to get your sleep right.
9064.52 Get your sleep right
if you are wishing
9066.37 to conceive and/or to
simply have healthy biology,
9069.82 to be fertile, or otherwise.
9071.1 That's just fundamental.
9072.1 Now, there are other
things to not do.
9075.49 And those, again, fall into the
somewhat obvious categories,
9078.063 but I think a lot
of people aren't
9079.48 aware of just how striking an
effect these certain behaviors
9084.13 that you want to avoid can have
in diminishing your fertility
9086.92 for both males and females.
9088.157 So let's talk about those.
9089.24 The first one is smoking.
9090.64 And when we talk
about smoking here,
9092.14 we're talking about
smoking nicotine
9094.66 and we're talking
about smoking cannabis.
9096.73 And indeed, there
are strong data--
9098.38 and I will put a
reference to one
9099.97 of the better larger
analyses of these data.
9102.25 There are strong data
showing that cannabis
9104.38 reduces fertility.
9105.92 Now, I can already hear
the screams from the back,
9108.49 although they're probably
fairly drawled out screams,
9112.3 from the back of people
saying they smoke cannabis
9114.95 and they had no
trouble conceiving.
9116.92 Certainly, there
will be exceptions.
9118.42 But whether or not
you're male or female,
9120.34 smoking cannabis is a
bad idea if you want
9122.53 to conceive a healthy child.
9123.85 Can you still conceive a healthy
child while smoking cannabis?
9127.63 Probably certain people can.
9129.34 Many people will greatly
decrease the probability
9132.85 of a healthy fertilization and
pregnancy by smoking cannabis.
9136.4 There are excellent
data to support that.
9138.87 As well, nicotine,
both smoked or vaped,
9142.11 is going to disrupt the
process of fertilization
9147.15 and can disrupt
pregnancy dramatically.
9149.83 So just avoid it altogether.
9151.075 How does this happen?
9151.95 Well, it turns out that smoking
increases what are called
9154.325 reactive oxygen species.
9155.74 This greatly
disrupts the quality
9158.088 of the egg at the level of
the spindle and mitochondria
9160.38 and a number of other features.
9161.82 And in the sperm, turns out
that smoking doesn't necessarily
9165.45 disrupt the sperm
directly, although it
9167.34 can cause DNA
fragmentation, which
9170.07 can cause all sorts
of abnormalities,
9171.9 can prevent fertilization,
can lead to birth defects
9174.36 in the offspring.
9175.15 But more importantly,
it increases
9177.72 what are called reactive oxygen
species in the seminal fluid,
9180.45 in the semen that
contain the sperm,
9182.2 this very, under
normal circumstances,
9184.98 under healthy
circumstances, beautifully
9187.14 orchestrated chemistry of
fluid that allows the sperm
9190.2 to thrive in their
trajectory and attempt
9193.65 to fertilize the egg and
lead to a healthy pregnancy.
9196.3 So if you are a smoker
and you want to conceive,
9199.74 the best advice I can give
you is to quit smoking.
9201.87 And yes, that includes
cannabis as well.
9203.74 Now, I am not somebody
who believes that cannabis
9205.83 across the board is not useful.
9207.22 There are medical applications
and other applications.
9209.47 I talk about that in an
episode all about cannabis
9212.16 for health and disease.
9213.3 And notice, health
was in there too.
9214.8 So you cannabis smokers,
don't come after me with--
9217.77 I guess, whatever it
is-- with bongs and pipes
9220.05 or whatever it is that
you want-- or with vapes.
9222.15 The point is that,
while it can be
9224.73 beneficial for
certain populations,
9226.38 it's certainly bad for others.
9228.49 And if you're
trying to conceive,
9230.55 it is bad for fertility and
for a healthy pregnancy.
9233.88 Now, that's smoking--
and vaping, by the way.
9237.81 Vaping is included there.
9239.4 Now, the next category of
don'ts relates to alcohol.
9243.42 Now, everyone has heard that
drinking during pregnancy
9245.82 is a bad idea.
9247.05 You may have heard
and some people
9248.49 have talked about
the fact that there
9250.35 are cultures in
which they allow,
9253.47 if you will, or
even condone, sadly,
9256.23 one or two drinks
while pregnant,
9258.18 provided it's just champagne
or something of that sort.
9260.79 That is a terrible idea.
9262.45 I did an episode
all about alcohol,
9264.52 both its potential
health effects,
9266.73 of which there turned
out to be zero.
9268.5 And yes, that includes red wine.
9270.54 It is far better to
not drink at all.
9272.462 And if you're going
to drink, the limit--
9274.17 if you're a healthy
adult who's not
9275.52 trying to conceive,
not pregnant,
9276.895 and you don't have
issues with alcoholism--
9278.76 is probably two
drinks per week total.
9282.04 That's right, two
drinks per week total.
9284.16 And that's the level
that you really
9285.84 should consider if you're a
drinker if you're somebody
9287.76 who's trying to conceive.
9288.9 However, for a woman
who becomes pregnant,
9291.265 the total number of drinks
that you should allow yourself
9293.64 per week while pregnant and
breastfeeding is indeed zero.
9297.75 There is absolutely no evidence
that one can, quote, unquote,
9300.87 "get away" with drinking
during pregnancy.
9303.15 And people say, well, I had
a perfectly healthy child.
9304.86 But, of course, you don't know
what the health of that child
9307.36 would have been had
you not drank at all.
9309.48 Now, I'm not here with any
generally strong stance
9311.97 against alcohol.
9312.78 I myself am somebody who
has a drink every once
9316.68 in a while, although I
don't consider myself
9318.73 somebody who has a strong
proclivity for alcohol.
9321.6 And of course, at
this moment, I'm
9323.85 not trying to conceive children
and I'm certainly not pregnant.
9327.01 So that's safe for me.
9328.77 But frankly, I haven't had
a drink in a very long time.
9331.69 And so I don't miss it.
9332.95 And that's me.
9333.54 But I do realize that a lot
of people enjoy alcohol,
9336.84 and so it's that
two drinks per week
9338.43 limit that really
sets the upper limit
9340.86 and threshold beyond which
you start running into issues
9343.26 with cellular mutation.
9345.12 You start running into issues
of oxidative stress, greatly
9349.38 increase cancer risk, in
particular breast cancer risk.
9351.9 All of that's covered in the
alcohol episode that we did.
9354.96 You can find it
at hubermanlab.com
9356.55 and timestamped if you want
to navigate to specific topics
9359.32 and so forth, find out all
about the data supporting
9361.56 the statements that I'm
making, so on and so forth.
9364.12 Now, if you're somebody who's
seeking to conceive or you fall
9366.96 into this category that some
couples describe themselves
9369.45 as we're not trying but
we're not not trying--
9371.863 meaning they're not
using birth control,
9373.53 they're kind of letting
chance run its course--
9376.83 well, then you
should definitely be
9378.6 aware of the data
showing that even just
9381.09 one bout, one bout of
so-called binge drinking,
9385.09 which is five to six drinks
in a given night or half day,
9389.43 in a 12-hour period-- one
bout of five to six drinks,
9392.97 if you're a woman
or you're a man,
9395.25 greatly increases both the
likelihood of mutations
9400.41 in the embryo that would
result from a fertilization
9403.87 and at the same time, for
reasons that should be
9405.87 obvious to you based on all
the biology we've talked about,
9408.328 a greatly reduced
probability of fertilization.
9411.07 Now, that absolutely
does not mean
9412.83 that you should use the
ingestion of five or six drinks
9415.38 as a method of birth control.
9417.48 That is not what
I'm saying here.
9418.92 What I'm saying is that, if
you go out on a given night
9422.55 and you have five or six
drinks and you happen
9424.77 to become pregnant,
the probability
9426.39 that that pregnancy will
be disrupted in some way
9430.14 is greatly increased.
9431.64 What the exact consequences
are, no one can tell you.
9435.07 But also, if you're somebody
who is interested in conceiving
9439.36 a child, well,
then you absolutely
9441.34 should abstain from ingesting
drinks more than one or two
9445.875 during the time in which
you're trying to conceive,
9448.0 and ideally it would be zero.
9449.65 And you certainly would
want to avoid drinking
9452.11 multiple drinks per night.
9453.46 And so this idea of going out
and having three or four drinks
9456.97 or four or five
drinks in a given
9458.83 night at a time in
which you're also
9461.02 trying to conceive children,
the biology tells us,
9464.74 the epidemiology tells us that
this is just a terrible idea.
9467.65 It's going to reduce the
likelihood of fertility
9470.26 and successful pregnancy.
9471.68 And if there is a
successful pregnancy,
9473.72 the word "success" needs
to be in quotes, right?
9476.38 I mean, I think every parent--
9478.45 every species, for
that matter-- wants
9480.7 to increase the probability
of having healthy offspring.
9484.52 And so, to my mind anyway and to
the OB/GYNs and the urologists
9488.65 that are focused on
fertility that I spoke to,
9490.9 everyone will say,
try as hard as you
9493.48 can to avoid these so-called
binge drinking episodes.
9496.535 And again, these
episodes are one night
9498.16 of consuming five to six drinks.
9499.69 Now, another important thing
to remember in this context
9502.03 is that the negative effects
of consuming five or six drinks
9505.99 in a given night extend
over many weeks following
9509.86 the ingestion of that alcohol.
9511.75 If you're a male,
what that means
9514.15 is that's going to impact
the quality of your sperm
9517.84 and greatly decrease
the likelihood
9519.55 of successful fertilization
and/or healthy pregnancy
9524.65 over the period of that entire
spermatogenesis window, which
9528.46 is, as we talked about before,
60 to 90 days, 60 to generate
9532.492 the sperm and then some
additional time for the sperm
9534.7 to be transported to the point
where they could be ejaculated.
9538.11 If you're a woman and you have
five or six drinks on a given
9540.61 night, well, then you are going
to disrupt the quality not
9544.18 of just the egg that
eventually ovulates
9546.85 but indeed the entire
pool of follicles that
9549.34 leaves the ovarian
vault in reserve
9551.38 and from which the one
egg will be selected.
9553.85 In other words, you are reducing
the quality of all of the eggs
9558.55 that you happen to
deploy that month.
9560.26 Now, some of you who were really
following the biology earlier
9562.928 might say, well, what if
I have those five or six
9564.97 drinks during the time in which
I'm menstruating, just in which
9568.15 there's bleeding present?
9569.77 And therefore, I
haven't yet ovulated.
9572.51 Ah!
9573.01 But if you remember the
biology we talked about earlier
9575.56 specifically, there is a
subset of follicles and eggs
9579.29 that leave that ovarian reserve
quite a bit before that one egg
9584.65 is selected for and ovulates.
9586.2 And of course, there are all
the different hormonal cascades
9588.7 and the general milieu
of the ovary which
9590.86 are important and
are being regulated
9592.493 by different hormones.
9593.41 And yes, indeed, the
regulation of those hormones
9595.96 is strongly impacted by
alcohol through a number
9598.435 of different pathways,
through the regulation
9600.31 of the neurotransmitter
GABA up in the brain--
9602.893 it's actually a lot of
GABA and GABA receptors
9604.81 in the hypothalamus, the
very region from which
9606.79 gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
our old friend from a couple
9609.55 hours ago in this
discussion, going
9612.07 to disrupt GnRH secretion.
9614.08 You can disrupt pituitary
function with alcohol.
9617.14 Again and again,
what we're seeing
9618.91 is that consuming more than
one or two drinks per week
9622.75 of alcohol is really detrimental
to the entire process
9625.96 of fertility and the entire
process of healthy pregnancy.
9629.44 And that's true from both
the male side and the sperm,
9632.17 and it's true from the
female side and the egg.
9634.63 So my simple advice
on this is if you
9636.58 are wishing to have a healthy
fertilization and pregnancy,
9640.96 the best thing to do would
be avoid alcohol altogether
9643.34 and, if you are going to
drink, to really limit
9645.298 that drinking to one or two
drinks per week maximum.
9648.64 So those are the major don'ts.
9649.9 Really avoid excessive stress.
9651.67 And I should mention,
excessive stress
9653.29 is not just best avoided by
getting enough quality sleep
9655.63 at night.
9656.0 Although that is
the primary way.
9657.49 There are other ways
to avoid stress.
9658.9 We've done entire
episodes about this,
9660.483 and we have a toolkit
related to reducing stress
9662.56 with very simple,
zero-cost tools.
9664.21 Again, you can find all
that at hubermanlab.com.
9666.31 And I should
mention, if you want
9667.685 to find any episode
or topic or timestamp,
9670.09 that website is keyword
search available.
9673.9 So you can just go
to hubermanlab.com,
9675.73 put into the search
function "stress tools,"
9678.04 and a bunch of different
links will pop up
9679.9 related to those topics,
likewise with sleep, likewise
9683.075 with any number of
different topics you
9684.7 might be interested in.
9685.7 So get enough quality sleep
and thereby reduce stress
9689.05 and also directly buffer
stress with real-time tools
9691.72 to buffer stress that I've
talked about in the episodes
9694.81 that you can access.
9695.77 And there are ways to greatly
reduce your overall level
9699.28 of stress, to limit
any cortisol that's
9701.59 released to early in the day,
which is when you want cortisol
9704.212 released, and not have
it late in the day
9705.92 and so on and so forth.
9707.03 So reduce your stress.
9708.16 And as I just told
you, by all means,
9713.07 do not drink more than
two drinks per week.
9715.4 And zero is better than two.
9716.81 If anyone tells you,
oh, well, there's
9718.46 all this resveratrol in red
wine, and that's good for us,
9721.94 the data simply
tell us there's not
9723.5 enough resveratrol in
red wine to really have
9725.393 any positive health benefit.
9726.56 The data around
resveratrol and health
9728.78 benefits itself is
under question nowadays.
9731.33 Zero alcohol is better
than any alcohol.
9734.18 Two drinks per
week is the limit.
9735.8 Also, limit or eliminate or
avoid nicotine and ideally
9741.83 cannabis, smoking and vaping,
at the time in which you
9744.71 are trying to get pregnant.
9746.48 And certainly, if
you are pregnant,
9748.07 avoid all of the things, as
best you can, that I just
9750.8 described a moment ago.
9752.25 Now, there are a couple of
other don'ts that are really
9754.542 important.
9755.19 One of the most important
don'ts relates to STIs,
9757.79 or sexually-transmitted
infections.
9759.77 Everyone who is sexually
active should get an STI check.
9762.57 In fact, if you go
to a fertility clinic
9764.66 or you go for sperm analysis
or you go for egg analysis,
9767.12 almost always they
will do an STI check,
9770.0 even if you happen to be in
a monogamous relationship,
9772.4 even if you happen to
be not sexually active
9774.233 and you're somebody
who is seeking
9775.65 to use IVF with a sperm donor
or something of that sort.
9778.01 Why would they do that?
9779.253 Why is there so much
concern about that?
9780.92 Is it about avoiding
giving birth
9783.26 to a child that has something
like a herpes infection or HIV?
9788.383 Well, certainly
that's one reason,
9789.8 but that's a down-the-line
reason, because
9791.45 at the time when someone
goes into the clinic for one
9793.658 of these sperm or egg analyses,
that's well in advance
9796.91 of any pregnancy, right?
9798.17 The reason is there
are a number of STIs--
9800.9 in particular chlamydia-- for
which it greatly increases
9804.35 the probability of miscarriage.
9805.79 So chlamydia is one of those
very insidious and cryptic STIs
9810.39 because a lot of people,
both males and females,
9812.39 don't even realize that
they have chlamydia,
9814.49 and then they can
carry chlamydia
9816.932 at the time in
which they conceive,
9818.39 and then that can lead
to ectopic pregnancies
9820.265 and/or miscarriages.
9821.48 So by all means,
get an STI check
9823.94 if you are somebody who's
seeking to conceive children
9826.52 or evaluating your
fertility generally.
9829.43 Chlamydia can also have damaging
effects on the epididymis
9831.98 and on the various other aspects
of male reproductive health.
9835.04 In the future, we
will do an episode
9836.54 all about sexual health.
9837.7 This is not the time for that.
9838.95 But get an STI
check if your goal
9840.92 is to conceive a healthy child.
9842.66 Now, the other thing that can
have a very negative impact
9845.21 on fertility and healthy
pregnancy is a viral infection.
9850.22 For instance, if a male has
had a severe viral illness--
9853.353 and this could be any number
of different viral illnesses,
9855.77 from flu to cold or any
number of different viruses.
9858.11 Pick your favorite virus--
9860.66 in the previous 70
to 90 days, that
9863.33 can greatly diminish the
number and/or quality of sperm.
9867.99 So that's really important.
9869.115 This is also important if you're
going to go in and do a sperm
9871.698 analysis and you had
a viral infection
9873.44 in the previous 70 to 90 days.
9875.385 Well, then you need
to be aware of that
9877.01 because it could greatly impact
the parameters of that sperm
9879.68 analysis.
9880.37 Likewise, for women, if you've
had a serious viral infection
9882.98 in the previous 30 days,
does that mean you should not
9884.87 try and conceive?
9885.578 Not necessarily, but you should
talk to your OB/GYN about that.
9889.28 There are data showing
that viral infection--
9892.55 in particular of influenza--
in the mother in the first
9895.34 trimester of pregnancy has some
correlation-- it's not 100%--
9899.48 but some correlation with
negative mental health outcomes
9902.54 of the offspring sometime
later, including schizophrenia.
9904.975 This is some of
the work that was
9906.35 done at Caltech a
number of years ago
9909.14 and other laboratories, as well.
9911.15 Those data are still
being built up over time.
9913.79 Again, it's not one-for-one.
9915.44 It's not causal.
9916.68 So if you did get an influenza
or a cold or other kind
9919.715 of viral infection during
the first trimester
9921.59 or any trimester of pregnancy,
I don't want to cause alarm,
9924.5 but you should talk to
your OB/GYN about this.
9926.96 The goal, of course, is to
avoid viral illness at any time
9929.45 when you're trying to conceive
or have a healthy pregnancy.
9932.66 But of course, sometimes
people will get ill,
9934.76 and the children can turn out
to be perfectly normal and fine.
9938.078 But it is something
that you want to avoid.
9939.87 And it will impact
your egg analysis,
9942.29 and it will impact
sperm analysis.
9944.385 And one thing I found
really surprising
9946.01 in researching this episode
was that 1 in 25 men
9951.35 carry a copy of a mutation
for cystic fibrosis.
9955.68 Now, some of you are probably
familiar with cystic fibrosis
9958.37 as a condition that
can cause issues
9960.952 with the lungs, the
accumulation of fluid
9962.66 in the lungs or other tissues.
9964.61 Cystic fibrosis,
in order to express
9967.07 that way of accumulation
of fluid in the lungs,
9969.11 you really need two copies.
9970.67 You need two mutant copies
or you need two copies
9973.88 of the cystic fibrosis gene.
9976.52 1 in 25 men will
carry just one copy
9979.28 and therefore will not have any
symptoms of cystic fibrosis.
9982.82 But those 1 in 25
men will have defects
9987.08 in the architecture of
the vas deferens, the duct
9990.62 through which the
ejaculate needs
9992.6 to pass in order to
eventually be ejaculated out
9996.5 of the urethra.
9997.53 And so what that means
is that these men can
10000.22 have what appears to
be normal semen volume
10002.26 but that they won't have
normal numbers of sperm.
10005.62 And that's not because of a
deficit in making the sperm.
10008.553 The testes can
function just fine.
10009.97 The brain and the
pituitary are communicating
10012.37 with the testes just fine.
10013.64 But that literally
the passageway
10015.28 by which those sperm arrive
within the seminal fluid
10017.8 and are eventually
ejaculated is disrupted
10020.26 by the cystic fibrosis gene.
10021.7 Luckily, if somebody has just
one copy of the cystic fibrosis
10025.03 gene and they're male
and this is the issue,
10028.0 the vas deferens either can be
repaired by a urologist who's
10033.55 expert in the surgical
repair of vas deferens
10035.77 or sperm can be extracted from
the testicle directly, which
10038.908 might sound like a
painful procedure,
10040.45 but I believe
nowadays, in talking
10042.64 with various experts
on this, it turns out
10044.5 that it can be done with
a minimum of discomfort.
10046.93 And certainly, if the goal
is to have a healthy child,
10049.24 you're going to
need those sperm,
10050.44 so you're going to want to
get them one way or the other,
10052.815 regardless of the discomfort.
10054.048 Now, before getting
into some of the things
10055.84 that you can do in
the positive sense
10057.55 to increase your
fertility, we do
10059.093 need to touch on just
a few other things
10060.76 that you want to avoid
in order to avoid
10063.04 diminishing your fertility.
10064.54 And this mainly
relates to males,
10066.04 but it will also be
relevant to females.
10068.625 And of course, when I say
also relevant to females,
10070.75 I'm referring to the fact that,
if it's a woman and a man who
10073.84 are trying to conceive,
then she, of course,
10076.585 is going to be interested in her
egg quality but also the sperm
10079.21 quality.
10079.78 And of course,
there are women who
10081.197 are conceiving by way of sperm
donor, through IVF or IUI
10084.79 or otherwise.
10085.57 But in any case, the need
to understand and maximize
10090.76 the quality of both the egg
and the sperm is paramount.
10093.44 So in order for men to maximize
the quality of their sperm,
10096.58 as I mentioned
earlier, does not seem
10098.5 to be a big difference
whether or not they use boxers
10100.81 or briefs or whether or not
they, quote, unquote, "go
10103.15 commando," they don't wear any
boxers or briefs of any kind.
10107.09 However, it is important to
keep the testicles cool enough.
10110.62 They need to be about
2 degrees cooler
10112.42 than the rest of the body.
10113.93 And there are a number of
different ways to do that.
10116.36 As I mentioned before,
avoid going in hot tubs
10118.695 during the period
in which you're
10120.07 trying to conceive children.
10122.65 You should also
avoid going in saunas
10124.413 during the period
in which you are
10125.83 trying to conceive children.
10126.997 And if you do go in the sauna,
you can bring an ice pack there
10129.67 and you can put it
on the testicles
10131.89 in order to offset
the heat of the sauna
10135.1 and keep the testicles
cool while in the sauna.
10138.608 The other thing that you'll
definitely want to do
10140.65 is avoid putting a laptop
or any other hot device
10143.62 directly onto your lap.
10144.91 There are a number
of different devices
10148.362 that you can put on your lap.
10149.57 You could put books
or a box or there
10151.13 are these devices that
are designed to dispel
10153.23 the heat from the laptop.
10154.48 I would say, if you're
trying to conceive,
10156.23 just keep the laptop
off of your lap.
10157.933 Just put it on a table or
standing desk or whatever.
10160.1 Just keep it off of your lap.
10162.2 Also, there are some
really interesting data
10164.3 showing that the amount of
time that men spend sitting,
10167.288 regardless of whether
or not they sit
10168.83 with their ankle on their
opposite knee or with knees
10173.03 spread, the classic man spread
stance, or any other kind
10177.41 of seated stance is
going to increase
10179.81 the temperature of the
scrotum for reasons that
10182.815 are somewhat
obvious if you think
10184.19 about the architecture
of all this.
10185.52 I think both men and women, if
you put enough thought to it,
10187.25 you go, oh yeah, that would
increase the temperature.
10189.458 Obviously avoid seat heaters
in cars or otherwise.
10193.19 But reducing the total amount
of time that you spend seated
10197.3 is really important if you
want to keep the temperature
10200.3 milieu of the scrotum
optimal for sperm quality
10203.33 and fertilization.
10204.297 And as I mentioned
earlier, it's going
10205.88 to be important to make
sure that your legs are not
10208.61 really big to the point
where they are creating
10211.73 a hotter than is healthy
environment for the scrotum
10215.36 and testicles.
10216.08 So a hotter than normal
environment for the testicles
10219.53 can be caused by legs
that are very large,
10221.96 upper thighs that are very
large due to obesity or due
10225.71 to those upper thighs
being too muscular.
10227.84 So by all means,
don't skip leg day.
10229.37 But be aware that if
you're somebody who's
10230.78 trying to conceive,
you want to do whatever
10232.572 you can to reduce the
temperature of the scrotum
10236.06 or at least not let it
get too hot for too long.
10240.09 So I can think of
all sorts of reasons
10243.297 now that men are
going to come up with
10244.88 to do the man spread
stance of their knees
10247.97 really far apart, even further
if they have large legs.
10250.46 That's not a discussion
we want to have here,
10252.11 and that's not really what
today's discussion is about.
10253.94 Really the principle is
what's most important, which
10256.107 is to keep the
temperature of the scrotum
10257.99 and testicles lower than
the rest of your body.
10261.33 There's a direct blood flow from
the body to the testicle that
10264.38 provides blood flow.
10265.28 It's designed in a way
that that blood pathway
10269.78 should be outside the
body and as far away
10272.42 from the body as
possible in order
10274.31 to get the temperature
milieu of the scrotum
10276.2 and testicle correct for
healthy sperm quality.
10278.93 Now, a topic that is sure
to be a bit controversial--
10281.417 but it really shouldn't
be because the data,
10283.25 at least to me, are very clear--
10285.8 is this issue of phone
use and sperm quality.
10289.91 Now, this can open up a
whole array of issues related
10294.17 to things like EMFs,
and you've got people
10296.21 out there who have ideas about
5G and all of this stuff.
10300.14 That is not what this
discussion is about.
10302.06 The discussion I'm about to have
with you relates to the fact
10305.15 that the electromagnetic fields
and the heat-related effects
10309.32 of smartphones can indeed
have a detrimental effect
10313.25 on sperm quality and, yes,
indeed, on testosterone levels
10316.73 as well.
10317.54 I'm going to refer
you to a paper.
10319.09 We will link it in the
show note captions.
10320.84 The title of this paper is
"Effects of Mobile Phone
10323.45 Usage on Sperm Quality.
10324.95 No time-dependent
relationship on usage.
10327.71 A systematic review and
updated meta-analysis."
10330.24 This is the paper
that came out in 2021
10333.2 and talks about the fact
that phones emit a radio
10336.02 frequency electromagnetic
waves, which
10338.18 are called RF, radio frequency,
EMWs, electromagnetic waves,
10342.5 at a low level between 80
and 2,200 megahertz that
10346.85 can be absorbed by the
human body-- we know this.
10349.31 This is not controversial-- and
have potential adverse effects
10351.98 on brain, heart,
endocrine system,
10353.27 and reproductive function.
10354.353 That has been established.
10356.12 Keep in mind, there is
basically no controversy
10359.12 that radio frequency
waves and EMFs
10361.55 can have a negative impact
on biological tissues.
10363.81 The question is, how intense
are those radiofrequency waves
10367.91 and EMFs, and how
detrimental are those
10371.225 on those biological tissues?
10373.22 It's a matter of degrees.
10374.73 But there is very
little controversy as to
10376.55 whether or not they have an
effect on biological tissues.
10378.925 And I'm aware of absolutely
zero data showing
10381.29 that they can have a positive
effect on biological tissues.
10383.78 Since what we're mainly talking
about now are smartphones,
10386.51 we want to separate out the
heat effects of smartphones
10388.91 from the EMFs
related to the fact
10390.74 that they are Wi-Fi
smartphones or they're
10393.23 using cellular
towers and Wi-Fi, one
10396.74 or the other or a combination.
10398.31 So there are a number of
different things in the phone
10400.19 that could be detrimental.
10401.21 We need to separate those out.
10402.14 Why?
10402.74 Well, because you
might have heard
10404.33 that carrying your
phone in your pocket
10405.955 can reduce your testosterone
levels and sperm count.
10408.59 And guess what, that is true.
10410.96 The data contained
within this meta-analyses
10413.24 and other meta-analyses
clearly point out
10415.67 that it can reduce sperm count
and maybe testosterone levels
10419.42 significantly, but certainly
sperm count and motility
10422.33 significantly.
10423.11 It reduces sperm quality.
10424.85 So should you avoid putting your
phone in your pocket, certainly
10428.97 your front pocket?
10429.72 I would suggest yes,
if you are somebody
10432.02 who is seeking to conceive.
10433.82 I'm not somebody who is going
to stop using my smartphone.
10436.237 I don't expect anyone's going
to stop using their smartphone.
10438.778 The question is, should you
carry it in your front pocket
10441.41 if you're a male?
10442.49 I think, to be on the
safe side, the answer
10444.59 is probably avoid doing
that too much of the time.
10447.01 Ideally, don't do it at all.
10448.81 Then people will say, well,
what if I turn off the Wi-Fi
10452.98 or I turn off the
cellular access?
10455.5 Then is it still a problem?
10457.07 Well, it's a problem due to
the heat-related effects.
10459.91 And then people say,
well, I don't actually
10461.77 feel the heat of the phone.
10462.895 It doesn't get that warm.
10464.05 But the temperature effects
of the phone, it turns out,
10468.7 are enough, even under
conditions in which people
10471.49 don't report it to be
uncomfortably warm, that it can
10474.4 change the temperature
milieu of the testicle
10476.483 in ways that can
diminish sperm quality.
10478.15 How much and how that
relates to fertility
10480.82 and healthy pregnancy,
not clear, but since we're
10483.49 talking about things
to avoid, if your goal
10485.59 is to have a healthy
fertilization and pregnancy,
10489.145 well, then, by all means,
just don't carry it
10491.02 in your front pocket.
10491.83 Then people say, well,
what about back pocket
10493.27 or what about backpack?
10494.32 Look, it's very
clear that avoiding
10497.17 being too close to the phone is
probably better for your sperm
10500.38 quality than putting the phone
very close to your testicles
10504.19 or anywhere else on your body.
10505.93 But it's also the reality
that most people are going
10508.24 to carry a phone nowadays.
10510.28 It's just the reality.
10511.34 I think the current estimates--
and it's discussed in this
10514.84 paper-- that 90% of the human
population has a smartphone--
10519.04 90%, which is incredible-- the
adult population, of course.
10522.43 Although a lot of kids
have them, as well.
10524.18 So this paper goes on to detail
a number of different studies
10526.78 and outcomes from studies.
10527.89 But basically what they find--
and here I'm paraphrasing--
10530.307 is that the data indicate
that sperm quality declines
10533.855 when people start
using a mobile phone.
10535.48 So from the point they
start using a mobile phone,
10537.25 regardless of the usage
time-- this is important.
10539.45 It used to be thought that it
was four hours a day or more
10542.2 of holding your phone or having
that phone close to your body
10545.63 was going to diminish
sperm quality.
10547.13 It turns out that it's
not related to usage time.
10549.01 That's even the
title of the paper.
10550.48 It's just the fact
that people are
10551.897 using mobile phones is reducing
sperm count and quality.
10555.7 That's the reality.
10556.66 Is it entirely responsible for
all the reductions in sperm
10559.918 quality and maybe
even the reductions
10561.46 in testosterone levels that
we're observing from decade
10563.752 to decade going forward?
10565.39 I doubt that's the case.
10566.68 Is it likely to be one
of the major players?
10569.14 I've got my bet on the fact
that it is based on the data
10573.1 that I've observed.
10573.97 And so if any of you
would like to peruse
10575.83 the data in this meta-analysis,
they're quite good.
10578.02 This study looked at 18 studies
that include 4,280 samples.
10582.34 They were able to
separate out the radio
10584.62 frequency versus
the heat effects,
10586.39 and they were able to eliminate
this time of usage variable,
10590.68 that previously we thought
if you were exposed
10592.63 to a lot of cell
phone contact, then
10595.163 it was far worse than if you
were exposed to a little bit.
10597.58 Turns out, if you're
exposed to any at all,
10599.23 you're going to
diminish sperm quality.
10600.77 What does that mean?
10601.51 Does that mean
that no matter what
10602.71 you do, if you own a
smartphone, that you're going
10604.793 to diminish sperm quality?
10606.01 I think the short answer is yes,
but that you can mitigate it.
10609.43 What might you do?
10610.48 Well, keeping your phone away
from your groin or as far
10612.898 from your groin as
possible if you're
10614.44 a male who's wishing to
conceive and maybe even a male
10616.69 who's wishing to maximize his
testosterone levels because it
10619.99 does appear that radiofrequency
waves and the heat
10622.39 from the phone--
10623.2 so both of those factors,
independently and together,
10626.11 of course--
10626.8 can disrupt the Leydig
cells of the testes
10628.99 and the production
of testosterone,
10630.58 and intratesticular
testosterone is
10632.89 important for sperm production.
10634.42 The exact biological variables
leading to all of these changes
10637.36 isn't exactly clear.
10638.78 But if you're like
me, you say, OK,
10640.36 probably not a problem for most
males to carry their phone.
10643.72 But probably best to not
carry it in the front pocket.
10646.66 Maybe even avoid carrying it
in the back pocket as well.
10649.01 Again, in the future,
we will have an episode
10650.885 all about Bluetooth.
10651.85 We'll talk about
various aspects of EMFs.
10654.76 It's a super
interesting data set.
10657.01 And it's a data set for which
there's a ton of controversy.
10660.16 It's really
interesting, however,
10661.995 and there are more and more
quality data coming out
10664.12 all the time.
10664.713 And I think, going
forward, we are
10666.13 going to see that, indeed,
there are some negative effects
10668.547 of smartphones related to
both the radio frequency
10671.35 transmission and the fact
that they generate heat.
10675.67 And in general, heat is not
good for biological tissues.
10678.77 So any discussion
about heat and sperm
10680.71 and how heat is
detrimental to sperm
10683.68 has to raise this
issue of whether or not
10685.54 cold is good for the testicle.
10687.4 OK, well, now there's
a lot of data starting
10689.83 to come out about
the positive effects,
10692.41 the positive biological effects,
of deliberate cold exposure
10696.79 on different aspects
of brain biology,
10699.79 such as the release of
dopamine and norepinephrine,
10702.07 and on the biology of the
body, to some extent metabolism
10705.4 but more so the impact on
brown fat stores, which
10707.95 are good for us, so-called
brown fat thermogenesis.
10710.56 There's a lot related to
deliberate cold exposure,
10713.3 and we've done entire episodes
on deliberate cold exposure.
10716.05 Again, you can find
that at hubermanlab.com.
10717.91 We did a guest
episode with an expert
10719.95 on the use of cold for
health and performance
10722.518 with my colleague Craig Heller
from Stanford Department
10724.81 of Biology.
10725.38 We also have a toolkit on how to
apply deliberate, cold exposure
10729.64 for health for both
females and for males--
10732.31 for sports performance,
cognitive performance, mood,
10734.69 sleep, et cetera.
10735.43 You can find all that,
again, at hubermanlab.com.
10737.472 Totally zero cost.
10739.055 Just go into the menu, go to
newsletter, and scroll down,
10741.43 and you'll find those.
10744.07 When thinking about
sperm quality,
10746.29 we want remember that
excessive heat is bad.
10748.86 Now, does that mean that
deliberate cold is good?
10751.77 Well, it turns out that one
of the major causes of lowered
10755.76 sperm count and overall
reduced sperm quality that's
10760.32 quite common is the presence
of what's called a varicocele.
10762.87 A varicocele is kind of like
varicose veins of the veins
10766.8 that innervate the testicle.
10768.6 And what it
essentially does is it
10771.78 means that blood will pool
in the testicular region.
10776.19 It can't circulate back to
the body quickly enough.
10778.56 And therefore, the temperature
of that environment increases.
10780.75 There are some other
things that varicoceles
10782.583 do which can be obstructive
at the physical level.
10784.71 So they're not just
temperature related.
10786.69 It's pretty clear that using
deliberate cold exposure
10790.47 can be healthy for the
sperm because of the ways
10793.11 not that cold directly supports
testosterone or sperm quality
10798.12 but rather because
cold reduces heat.
10801.12 So you will find
available online--
10805.505 I think they're
actually called--
10806.88 forgive me, but that's
what they're called.
10808.26 I didn't name them--
called snowballs.
10809.843 These are-- they're sort of
like gel pack cold briefs
10814.53 that you can buy and men will
wear for some period of time.
10817.38 I don't think you
wear them all day.
10818.88 You wear them for
some period of time.
10820.86 A lot of people are now using
cold showers and ice baths
10824.04 and circulating cold baths
or going into a cold ocean
10826.38 or lake for any number
of different reasons
10828.482 I talked about earlier.
10829.44 I, myself, start every
day with either a one
10832.32 to three-minute
cold shower or a one
10833.98 to three-minute
immersion up to my neck
10836.52 in a cold bath, cold
water, circulating water,
10840.84 or a cold shower.
10841.743 I do that mainly for the
psychological effects
10843.66 related to the long
lasting increases
10845.4 in dopamine and epinephrine.
10846.935 But there are
other data starting
10848.31 to come out showing that
that sort of approach
10851.37 or similar approaches can
increase testosterone levels
10854.34 and maybe even sperm
counts, can reduce
10855.99 cortisol late in the evening if
the cold exposure is done early
10858.54 in the day, so on and so forth.
10859.832 So a lot of interesting data
coming out in really good
10862.17 journals that are peer-reviewed
and so on-- in humans,
10866.783 I should mention, those
studies are done in humans--
10868.95 to support the use of
deliberate cold exposure.
10870.99 But again, if you're going to
use deliberate cold exposure
10873.407 to improve sperm
quality, can it work?
10875.31 Yes, indeed, it can
work, either indirectly
10877.8 by increasing
testosterone or directly
10879.75 by improving sperm quality.
10881.13 But both of those effects
are likely to be indirect
10883.83 by virtue of reducing the
temperature of the testicle
10886.74 overall, not because there's
any sort of magic effect of cold
10890.49 on the testicle.
10891.42 Now, I have to imagine
that a number of you,
10893.253 in particular the females
listening to this,
10895.41 are going to say, is
deliberate cold exposure--
10898.318 and for that matter, is
deliberate heat exposure,
10900.36 like sauna or hot tub--
good or bad for the ovary,
10903.63 for eggs, and for fertility?
10905.04 Now, there are fewer data
to look to, unfortunately.
10909.3 But what we do know is that
deliberate cold exposure
10912.45 done in the way that
I just described-- one
10914.26 to three minutes a day,
ideally early in the day,
10916.438 through cold shower or
immersion up to the neck--
10918.48 doesn't have to be an ice bath.
10919.772 It could be cold
circulating water or even
10922.14 non-circulating cold water.
10923.58 And people will
say, well, how cold?
10925.14 I should have
mentioned that before.
10926.64 How cold?
10928.15 There is no way I can
tell you exactly how
10930.567 cold the water should be,
because for some people,
10932.65 60 degrees Fahrenheit
will be exceedingly cold.
10934.998 For other people, 40 degrees is
going to be more appropriate.
10937.54 How cold should you make it?
10938.8 If you're going to embrace
these practices, you want--
10941.81 according to the literature,
what you want to do
10943.81 is make it
uncomfortably cold such
10946.03 that you really want
to get out, but safe.
10948.28 You don't want to go into
30-degree water immediately.
10951.19 You can actually have a heart
attack and die if you do that.
10953.69 So you want to progress
gradually into the cold.
10956.86 So you don't want to shock
your system too much.
10959.02 Although it is the adrenaline
evoked by that [GASPS],,
10961.84 that quickening or
shortening or elimination
10964.06 of the breath for a
short period of time
10965.727 when you get into
uncomfortably cold water that
10967.9 correlates with or is
actually the reflection of--
10970.57 would be more accurate to
say-- the release of adrenaline
10972.97 and then dopamine
and so forth, which
10974.83 has been very well documented.
10976.64 So uncomfortably cold,
but safe to stay in.
10980.27 And I cannot tell you an exact
number that is uncomfortably
10983.98 cold but safe for you.
10985.1 It's going to differ
person by person.
10986.41 You want to figure that out.
10987.31 Just like I can't tell you how
much weight that you should
10989.727 squat in order to achieve
some effective resistance
10992.175 training for the
legs, it's going
10993.55 to differ depending
on your strength
10996.01 and your prior
experience and so forth.
10997.73 So ease into it.
10998.53 Be safe.
10999.22 But it does appear
that both for men,
11001.38 for reasons I talked about a
few minutes ago, and for women
11005.7 that deliberate, cold
exposure can be beneficial
11008.94 for fertility and for
hormone production,
11011.61 but in particular for females
in terms of regulating cortisol
11015.145 and for hormone production.
11016.27 Now, you might say, OK,
getting into cold is stressful.
11018.3 How can that be helpful
for regulating stress?
11020.07 Well, it turns out, when
you get into the cold,
11022.028 you get a big
surge in adrenaline
11023.46 and then dopamine, which
is very long lasting,
11025.44 provided that's done in
the early part of the day.
11027.7 So I would say, not
too close to sleep.
11030.09 Then what you do is you restrict
your maximum cortisol release
11033.3 to a period earlier in
the day that buffers--
11037.32 reduces, that is--
the likelihood
11039.15 that you would have excessive
amounts of cortisol later
11041.907 in the day, which not
only can disrupt sleep
11043.74 but is correlated with a number
of other hormonal effects that
11047.43 are not good for
us and therefore
11048.96 not good for fertility.
11050.1 So here what I'm
describing are positive
11051.99 yet indirect effects of
a cold on hormone levels
11056.49 both in males and in females.
11059.08 So for men, we talked about
increased testosterone,
11061.68 improved sperm quality
that was indirect.
11063.75 You're reducing the
temperature of the testicle.
11066.12 But it's not that cold
itself is positively
11068.262 impacting those things.
11069.22 Does that make sense?
11069.69 Heat is bad.
11070.48 Therefore, reducing
temperature is good.
11072.33 Likewise, with females,
deliberate cold exposure
11075.39 can be good for the
overall fertility process,
11078.15 not because cold is good
for the ovary or being
11081.24 cold is good for the ovary
or for luteinizing hormone
11084.82 or for follicle-stimulating
hormone or anything
11086.79 else like that, but rather that
using deliberate cold exposure
11091.02 as a way to restrict
stress in a deliberate
11093.36 way to a particular
time of day increases
11096.33 the release of cortisol,
then, and indirectly reduces
11099.427 the amount of cortisol
that's released
11101.01 at other times along
the 24-hour cycle.
11104.05 So these are positive
yet indirect effects.
11106.36 So if you're a woman who really
is interested in exploring
11109.71 deliberate cold exposure or
who enjoys it or is already
11112.5 doing it and you're
wishing to conceive, great.
11115.11 Explore it.
11115.825 Do it safely, of
course, but explore it
11117.45 and continue to do it.
11118.36 However, if you're somebody
who just hates the cold
11120.33 and doesn't want to
go anywhere near it,
11121.65 there's no reason to think
that you absolutely need it,
11123.6 provided that your stress,
your sleep, and other factors
11125.97 are all being
carried out properly.
11127.578 The next things that
we'll talk about
11129.12 in terms of positive
things or things
11130.98 that we can do in order
to maximize fertility
11133.41 for both females and
males are the things
11135.39 that you also generally
hear about elsewhere.
11137.91 Right along with sleep and
avoiding alcohol and avoiding
11141.09 nicotine and avoiding cannabis,
avoiding excessive heat
11144.06 for the testicle,
avoiding excessive stress,
11146.88 is that you want to try
to get enough exercise.
11151.65 Why would exercise have
anything to do with any of this?
11154.57 Well, exercise-- and that
is both a combination
11157.53 of resistance training and
cardiovascular exercise--
11159.9 is going to improve the
health of the mitochondria--
11162.39 in particular,
cardiovascular exercise.
11164.352 And I realize that for you
fitness experts out there,
11166.56 any time someone says "cardio,"
people kind of roll their eyes,
11169.185 like, what is that?
11170.25 There's endurance training.
11171.6 There's interval training.
11172.71 There's HIIT training.
11173.73 There's sprints.
11174.467 There's all sorts
of different things.
11176.05 Some of those overlap.
11176.79 Some of them are separate.
11178.02 Indeed, that's the case.
11179.25 But we can use a general
rule of thumb here, which
11182.28 is that, for most people,
getting anywhere from 30
11185.22 and ideally 45 to 60
minutes of exercise per day
11189.24 for six days per week,
maybe even seven--
11191.49 but most people like to
take a day off or need
11193.56 to take a complete
day off each week--
11195.18 six to seven days
per week is going
11196.86 to be good for mitochondrial
health and function.
11199.342 It's also going to impact
all the other things,
11201.3 like quality sleep,
mood, reducing stress,
11203.55 and so on and so forth.
11204.67 So exercise we can handle pretty
quickly by just saying everyone
11208.65 should be doing it.
11209.82 Now, when people are pregnant,
they might have to, of course,
11212.92 change the amount of exercise
or the type of exercise
11215.148 that they're doing.
11215.94 There are varying
opinions on that,
11217.398 but certainly the type of
exercise and the amount
11220.35 can vary when
people are pregnant.
11221.86 But if you're
seeking to conceive,
11223.497 getting enough exercise
is good because it's
11225.33 good for the mitochondria.
11226.413 The mitochondria are present in
that mid region of the sperm.
11230.34 And mitochondria are critical
for chromosomal segregation
11234.48 and the spindle
and other aspects
11236.7 of the formation of a
healthy egg, ovulation,
11238.89 and fertilization in the female.
11240.228 One thing that I
know a lot of people
11241.77 are interested in nowadays is
so-called intermittent fasting
11244.77 or time-restricted feeding.
11246.3 I mean, let's be fair, everybody
is restricting their feeding
11248.877 time because hopefully
everybody is sleeping
11250.71 at some point in
the 24-hour cycle,
11252.51 and nobody is eating
while they are sleeping.
11255.33 That said, many
people are employing
11257.97 a so-called eight-hour feeding
window or a 10-hour feeding
11260.562 window or a 12-hour
feeding window.
11262.02 And indeed, there are some data
to support the idea that that
11265.005 can be a good thing for a number
of different biological and
11268.08 health parameters.
11268.9 However, there are
also a lot of data,
11271.832 especially recently,
pointing to the fact
11273.54 that your overall
number of calories
11275.97 and the quality of
your food sources
11277.74 is going to be the most
important variable.
11279.93 And some people simply find
that time-restricted feeding--
11282.69 intermittent fasting,
as it's also called--
11285.15 is just a convenient
way to ensure
11287.07 that your total
intake of calories
11289.23 is not excessive
for what you need.
11291.27 Now, with all that
said, there is evidence
11294.21 that I've covered
in a solo episode
11295.703 and will soon have
an expert guest
11297.12 on showing that time-restricted
feeding can have
11301.32 certain positive outcomes
for various aspects of organ,
11305.04 cellular, and tissue health.
11307.23 This is somewhat
controversial, but there
11309.03 is growing evidence that,
by restricting your feeding
11311.58 window to, say, 8 hours
or 10 hours or 12 hours,
11314.55 that it is better than if
you were to eat over a longer
11317.1 period of each 24-hour cycle.
11319.56 But again, the data
are still incoming.
11321.625 The reason we want to talk
about time-restricted feeding,
11324.0 intermittent fasting
is that a lot of people
11326.07 do use it because
they find it easier
11328.29 to not eat at certain periods
of their 24-hour cycle
11331.47 than to restrict calories.
11332.79 But again, keep in mind, you
have to restrict calories
11336.132 if your goal is to
maintain or lose
11337.59 weight, a discussion
that we've covered
11339.87 in that episode on
intermittent fasting
11341.79 and in the episode
with Dr. Layne Norton
11343.92 and that we will cover in
other episodes in the future.
11348.16 So refer to those episodes
at hubermanlab.com
11350.79 if you would like to learn more
about intermittent fasting,
11353.31 per se.
11354.06 For sake of this conversation,
a number of people
11356.7 are probably asking, if
I restrict my feeding
11359.61 to a certain window each
24 hours because that's
11362.983 what's convenient or
because I'm excited
11364.65 about the potential
positive effects
11366.18 of intermittent
fasting, is that going
11369.03 to disrupt the likelihood
of fertility and thereby
11373.5 a healthy pregnancy?
11374.67 And the short answer to
that is, if you are a female
11377.73 and you are having regular
menstrual cycles that
11379.95 is a fairly
consistent duration--
11382.45 so maybe it's 21
days, maybe it's
11384.24 35, or anywhere in
between, but it's
11385.83 fairly consistent
from month to month--
11387.488 and you are following
intermittent fasting,
11389.28 time-restricted
feeding, well, then
11391.14 chances are pretty
good that it's not
11393.48 disrupting your fertility and
likelihood of fertilization
11397.91 and a healthy pregnancy.
11398.91 Of course, during pregnancy,
you need to talk to your doctor
11401.94 and make sure that you're
eating in a way that's
11403.98 supportive both of you and
of the developing fetus.
11406.41 That's extremely important.
11407.86 I am not aware of
data exploring,
11410.85 in a regimented way,
time-restricted feeding
11413.1 during pregnancy.
11414.34 So please, please, please,
if you're pregnant,
11416.52 do not jump on a
time-restricted feeding,
11418.38 so-called intermittent
fasting diet.
11419.88 Talk to your OB/GYN.
11422.07 Talk to your doctor.
11423.72 Talk to multiple
doctors, for that matter,
11425.79 before doing anything like
that, because, of course,
11428.01 you're now eating for two, or
if you have twins in there,
11430.41 you're eating for three.
11432.15 Very important.
11433.08 If, however, you're
not yet pregnant
11434.58 and you want to be fertile, get
pregnant, or simply maintain
11439.02 a fertile potential
and biology and you're
11442.77 following intermittent
fasting, it's
11444.78 going to be the regularity of
those periods and regularity
11447.748 of cycle length that will
tell you whether or not
11449.79 that's a good idea or not.
11451.35 Keeping in mind, of course,
that if your total number
11454.68 of calories is too low,
your periods will cease.
11457.8 That's a well-known effect.
11459.67 But of course, stress
can also induce
11462.78 cessation of menstruation.
11465.42 And there are other factors
that can induce cessation
11467.76 of menstruation as well.
11469.15 Some of them start with changes
in the brain, literally,
11472.417 in the hypothalamus.
11473.25 Some occur in the pituitary.
11474.93 Many lifestyle
factors can do that.
11477.39 But most typically,
it's going to be
11479.19 excessive caloric
restriction or it's
11481.71 going to be a caloric
deficit brought on
11484.32 by excess physical activity.
11486.52 So even if someone's
eating a lot,
11488.28 if they're not eating enough to
offset their physical activity
11492.06 or they're not eating
enough of, in particular,
11494.22 fats, the essential
fatty acids and protein,
11497.49 but also carbohydrates, well,
then menstruation can cease.
11500.24 And of course, if
menstruation is ceasing,
11501.99 chances are, almost
with certainty,
11504.15 that you're not getting
regular ovulations.
11506.32 Now, in terms of males
and whether or not
11508.243 intermittent fasting
is going to disrupt
11509.91 spermatogenesis and
testosterone production,
11513.66 there's essentially no
data we can look to.
11516.49 But we can look to
the general logic
11518.1 around the relationship
between body fat, testosterone,
11522.42 and spermatogenesis.
11523.53 And this was something
that was covered
11525.21 in a discussion I had on
optimization of hormone
11528.95 health for males that I
had with Dr. Kyle Gillette,
11531.35 who's a medical doctor
and obesity specialist.
11533.72 Again, you find that
episode at hubermanlab.com
11536.03 if you want to learn all about
hormone optimization in males.
11539.0 And essentially, the
story is as follows.
11541.62 If a male is
excessively overweight,
11544.77 he's carrying too much body
fat in particular, not too
11547.37 much muscle--
11547.912 although that can
be an issue too,
11549.328 but too much body fat
is typically the issue--
11551.45 so more than, say,
20% body fat--
11555.53 well, then losing
body fat is going
11558.02 to be the primary goal for
maximizing testosterone, sperm
11561.29 health, and spermatogenesis.
11563.69 If, however, a male is already
lean, well, then actually
11567.92 increasing calories will
increase testosterone.
11571.19 So it's a bit of a
complicated story,
11573.587 although not so complicated that
none of us can understand it.
11576.17 Basically, if you're
overweight, you
11578.03 should focus on losing weight in
order to maximize sperm quality
11580.94 and health.
11581.51 If you are very lean, well,
then restricting your calories
11585.08 to the point where you are
starting to lose weight
11587.96 or you're dropping
even more body fat
11590.66 is unlikely to increase
your testosterone further.
11593.75 It doesn't necessarily
mean it's bad
11595.37 or that you shouldn't
try and go, for instance,
11597.59 from 15% to 10% body fat.
11599.025 I'm not saying that
that's bad and that
11600.65 will reduce your testosterone.
11602.0 But in general,
if you're already
11603.38 very lean-- so 10%
body fat, 5% body
11606.408 fat-- and you start
restricting calories further,
11608.45 your testosterone
levels will drop.
11610.71 So in the context of
intermittent fasting,
11612.76 it's really not an
issue of whether or not
11614.51 your feeding window is
8 hours or 12 hours.
11616.64 It's really an issue
of whether or not
11618.223 you're getting enough calories
to offset the physical demands
11620.9 and activities of your
life, whether or not
11623.03 you're on a maintenance diet
to maintain your weight.
11625.28 And of course, you have to
put all that in the context of
11627.23 whether or not you're overweight
or lean to begin with.
11629.54 The simple thing to
take away from this
11631.25 is, if you're a
male who's using--
11633.14 because you like it--
intermittent fasting,
11635.12 so-called
time-restricted feeding,
11636.56 and you're following an
eight hour or maybe even
11639.523 a one meal per day
type approach--
11640.94 although I don't
really recommend
11642.11 that for a number of reasons
we could talk about separately.
11644.61 If you're eating over the course
of 8 or 10 or 12 hours per day
11647.96 because that's what works
for you and you are ingesting
11650.9 enough calories to maintain
your weight if you're already
11653.42 lean or you are
ingesting fewer calories
11658.51 than you are burning in order
to lose weight because you are
11661.01 already overweight and
you want to lose body fat,
11664.295 you're probably optimizing
for all the things
11666.17 that you need to do in order
to improve sperm quality
11668.93 and testosterone levels.
11670.31 Now, also in that
episode that I did
11672.02 with Dr. Kyle Gillette on
optimizing hormones for males,
11675.08 we talked about testosterone
replacement therapy.
11677.42 It's not a topic I want to get
into in any detail right now.
11680.19 But I will say this.
11681.74 Remember earlier when we were
talking about spermatogenesis
11684.38 and the fact that in order
for sperm to be generated
11686.87 consistently every month
ongoing from the time of puberty
11690.83 until essentially the
time that a man dies,
11694.04 you need two things.
11695.25 You need testosterone
production from the Leydig cells
11697.64 of the testes, and you
need spermatogenesis
11701.42 to be supported by that
androgen-binding protein
11704.54 coming from the support
cells, from the Sertoli cells.
11707.42 So you need
testosterone, and you
11708.8 need androgen-binding protein,
and you need the Leydig cells
11711.38 and the Sertoli cells active.
11713.27 When men take exogenous,
meaning from outside the body,
11716.39 testosterone, either by cream or
by patch or by pellets or more
11719.51 typically by injection--
the most typical TRT
11722.03 approach nowadays is
testosterone cypionate, which
11724.19 is biologically identical
to the kind of testosterone
11728.0 you would make.
11728.69 Well, because of negative
feedback loops, which you also
11731.12 learned about
earlier, the testicles
11733.82 themselves shut down their
own testosterone production.
11737.69 Why would that be?
11738.44 OK, so you're taking
testosterone in by syringe
11741.14 or by patch or any other method.
11743.88 So the circulating testosterone
and the amount that
11746.18 arrives at the testicle
is going to be hopefully
11749.69 clinically appropriate,
not super physiological,
11751.76 but it'll be somewhere in
the healthy reference range,
11754.01 maybe a little bit higher.
11755.203 Nowadays, some people are
going a little bit higher.
11757.37 So we're not talking about
full blown, quote, unquote,
11759.23 "anabolic steroid
use," keeping in mind,
11761.28 of course, that
estrogen is a steroid.
11762.947 Testosterone is a steroid.
11764.03 But when we think
about steroids,
11764.96 we mean like
performance-enhancing drugs, so
11766.793 super physiological doses.
11768.65 We're talking about
within physiological
11770.75 or near physiological ranges.
11772.62 So if someone's taking
their testosterone
11774.38 in from an outside,
exogenous, source,
11778.13 the levels of
circulating testosterone
11779.87 will be sufficiently
high that the pituitary
11782.15 will register that and will
stop making luteinizing hormone
11786.32 and generally
follicle-stimulating hormone,
11788.48 as well.
11789.08 And as a consequence,
spermatogenesis
11791.72 is vastly reduced or eliminated.
11794.48 In other words, for men
who are on TRT or who
11798.32 are taking testosterone
from an external source,
11801.95 the number of sperm that
they're going to make
11803.9 is going to be
dramatically reduced.
11805.53 There are things that they
can do to offset that,
11807.572 like taking hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, which is just
11810.5 kind of a mimic for
luteinizing hormone
11812.18 to stimulate the testes to
continue to make testosterone.
11816.23 And some men will also--
11818.45 or instead-- take FSH to
stimulate the Sertoli cells
11822.8 to support spermatogenesis--
excuse me--
11826.73 or both or some combination.
11828.33 Some people take
clomiphene, Clomid.
11830.09 There are any number
of different ways
11831.673 to bypass or offset the
sperm-reducing effects
11835.58 of taking exogenous
testosterone.
11837.6 This is a conversation
that was covered
11839.33 in a fair amount of detail in
that episode with Dr. Gillette.
11841.91 But just keep in mind that if
you are taking testosterone
11845.63 from an exogenous source, your
sperm counts will dramatically
11849.568 be reduced, unless you do
something to offset it.
11851.61 So if you are
wishing to conceive,
11853.137 you need to think
about whether or not
11854.72 you're going to offset the
testosterone replacement
11857.18 therapy or whether or not you're
going to come off it entirely.
11860.61 So you'll need to talk to
a urologist endocrinologist
11863.0 about that.
11864.65 And again, a number of these
different themes and ways
11867.08 to go about tapering
off TRT were
11868.82 covered in that episode
with Dr. Kyle Gillette.
11871.04 So if you're on TRT or
you're considering taking it
11873.38 and you're interested
in having children,
11875.088 not just now but at
any point, you really
11876.875 want to take these things
into consideration.
11878.75 Now, I do want to point out
that, for the number of you
11881.63 out there who are taking
supplements, some of which
11884.39 we've talked about
on this podcast
11885.86 and I've talked about in other
podcasts, such as tongkat ali--
11888.27 it turns out that there
are a lot of men and women
11890.353 taking tongkat ali to reduce
sex hormone binding globulin
11893.24 levels, to increase testosterone
and estrogen, in some cases,
11896.0 libido and so forth.
11898.19 Those approaches, meaning
supplement-based approaches,
11900.98 to increase testosterone
or free testosterone
11905.54 or some related
hormones, are not
11908.36 going to shut down your
own endogenous testosterone
11911.0 production and reduce the
number of sperm that you make
11913.94 or, at least as far as we
know, disrupt ovulation
11916.835 in any kind of way,
provided that the dosages
11918.71 are within normal ranges.
11919.76 Again, supplementation
to support your hormones
11922.97 should not disrupt
ovulation or spermatogenesis
11927.47 or testosterone production.
11928.76 Quite the opposite.
11929.76 It should enhance it.
11930.74 What I just described
around TRT as taking
11932.93 exogenous testosterone,
that itself
11935.39 is an entirely different beast.
11937.07 Now, with all of
that said, there
11938.84 are some supplements
out there that
11942.08 include testosterone
as a ingredient that's
11945.5 been snuck in to various
formulas that include
11949.308 blends and things of that sort.
11950.6 You want to be aware of that.
11951.808 And we did an episode about
how to develop a rational guide
11954.77 to supplementation.
11956.1 I highly recommend
listening to that episode.
11958.095 Again, it's timestamped,
available free
11959.72 at hubermanlab.com
in all formats.
11962.03 Because it talks about
which supplements
11964.52 are likely to be
"clean," quote, unquote,
11966.32 to contain the things that
you expect them to contain,
11968.42 there's more and more
evidence coming out that
11970.337 a lot of supplements,
including some--
11971.96 for instance,
supplements that contain
11974.51 testicle or the
extracts of testicles
11976.85 can contain testosterone.
11978.242 Whether or not they can shut
down your own endogenous
11980.45 testosterone
production isn't clear.
11982.293 No one's really
explored that in detail.
11983.96 But based on everything we
just talked about with TRT,
11985.97 it stands to reason that it
might either reduce it or shut
11988.56 it down.
11989.06 It's just never
been explored yet.
11990.87 So by all means, make sure
that what you're taking
11993.672 if you're taking supplements.
11994.88 But again, the
major point here is
11997.25 that, for both
females and males,
11998.66 taking supplements to
support healthy hormone
12001.24 production, including
things like tongkat ali,
12004.63 is not the same as taking
hormones or bioidentical
12008.44 hormones, which indeed can
shut down your own endogenous
12012.01 production of
hormones and thereby
12013.57 reduce both egg quality and
the chance of fertilization
12017.23 and healthy pregnancy
and sperm quality
12019.06 and the chance of fertilization
and healthy pregnancy.
12021.37 Any time there's a discussion
about fertility and pregnancy,
12025.54 there seems to also be
a parallel discussion
12027.7 about sex determination.
12029.47 That is, what factors can
influence whether or not
12032.83 the child that's born
is male or female.
12035.41 That is, whether or not it has
double X chromosomes-- so one X
12038.53 chromosome from mom, one
X chromosome from dad
12040.72 because the egg was
fertilized by a sperm that
12042.91 had an X sex chromosome,
that 23rd chromosome--
12046.15 or whether or not the offspring
is male, whether or not
12048.91 it has the X chromosome from
mom, because it's always going
12051.368 to be the X chromosome
in that egg,
12053.83 and a Y chromosome
from the sperm that
12056.14 fertilized that particular egg.
12057.815 Now, of course, there
are instances out
12059.44 there of people that have XXY
chromosomes or XYY chromosomes.
12064.87 But the vast majority
of people out there
12067.9 are going to have either
an XX chromosome-- so we
12072.04 call that a female karyotype.
12074.74 This is different than
genotype and phenotype,
12076.99 but a female karyotype
would be XX--
12080.23 or a male karyotype,
which would be XY.
12084.76 Now, despite the fact that
it is the egg and the sperm
12087.31 and the chromosomes
that they carry
12088.768 that are going to
determine the chromosomes,
12091.01 there's a lot of lore and
discussion about the factors
12094.27 that can bias which sperm
will fertilize the egg
12098.14 and thereby whether
or not you're
12099.67 going to get an XX, female,
or an XY, male, chromosome
12103.27 and therefore offspring.
12104.63 Now, not only is the lore
around this whole issue of sex
12107.68 determination rather prominent,
but it is also somewhat unusual
12112.33 and perhaps even interesting.
12113.86 So for instance,
Aristotle himself proposed
12117.58 that if a man is thinking about
himself and his own pleasure
12122.44 more than his partner
and her pleasure
12126.25 at the point of
ejaculation, then
12129.46 the offspring will be male.
12131.11 Aristotle also asserted
that if a man is thinking
12133.51 more about his partner
and her pleasure
12135.76 at the point in which he
ejaculates, well, then
12138.85 the offspring would be female.
12140.83 And of course, we
have zero reason
12143.17 to believe that there's any
truth to Aristotle's theory.
12146.11 There are no data
to support that.
12147.693 In fact, I'm not
even sure how you
12149.11 would run that experiment
because you can't really
12151.81 look at people's thoughts.
12153.31 You'd have to rely on
honest self-report.
12156.31 And even if people were
to faithfully report
12159.43 what they were thinking about
at the moment of ejaculation,
12162.35 this would involve, of
course, bringing people
12164.267 into the laboratory and
somehow measuring or analyzing
12167.22 their thoughts or
gathering their thoughts
12168.97 during the sexual intercourse
at the point of ejaculation,
12172.15 then figuring out which
biological sex was
12175.0 the offspring, et cetera.
12176.59 Just near impossible and
probably not the most important
12179.71 experiment to invest
our time doing.
12181.9 Nonetheless, there
continues to be
12185.26 a lot of lore about
what determines
12187.668 the sex of the offspring.
12188.71 Most notably, there's a
lot of lore and discussion
12191.17 and rumor about the idea that
particular sexual positions
12195.31 at the point of ejaculation
during intercourse
12198.04 can somehow bias the likelihood
that a pregnancy will
12202.03 be either resulting in
male or female offspring.
12206.43 Now, again, there are
zero data to support this,
12208.79 and yet this whole notion
of sex determination
12211.88 is a really interesting
one that people
12213.56 seem to be somewhat obsessed
by, so much so that, again,
12217.31 if you go online or
if you were to talk
12219.08 to people in the sort of
let's call it holistic
12222.17 or peripheral health spaces
related to fertility,
12226.26 there is discussion
about, OK, well,
12227.96 you take this sexual position
at the point of ejaculation
12230.42 to get a boy and you
take that sexual position
12232.337 at the point of
ejaculation to get a girl
12234.05 or you do this in the
early part of the day
12236.75 or the later part of the day.
12238.38 Again, all for
which there is zero
12240.71 data to support any kind
of systematic relationship
12244.34 between what I just discussed
and the biological sex
12246.53 of the offspring.
12247.37 That said, there are
now emerging methods
12251.21 that people are using in order
to separate out the sperm that
12257.0 will indeed give rise
to a male offspring
12260.36 versus a female offspring.
12261.87 Now, this, of course,
is done in the context
12263.72 of in-vitro fertilization.
12265.437 We haven't talked too much
about in-vitro fertilization.
12267.77 But in-vitro
fertilization involves,
12269.84 as the name suggests, taking
an egg and taking a sperm,
12273.8 pairing them in a dish.
12275.18 This can be done a
number of different ways.
12277.88 But just to briefly
describe the IVF procedure,
12280.91 IVF involves
administering supra--
12284.62 meaning greater than normal--
supraphysiological levels
12288.32 of follicle-stimulating
hormone and luteinizing hormone
12291.89 during the follicular
phase of a woman's cycle.
12294.44 What that causes is the
maturation of not just one
12298.31 egg that would be ovulated but
multiple follicles and eggs.
12303.63 And then ovulation
itself is suppressed also
12307.25 through the administration
of exogenous hormones.
12310.04 And then, under
ultrasound guidance,
12312.59 an OB/GYN goes in and collects
the mature eggs and follicles,
12316.43 puts them in a
dish, and then sperm
12318.337 are delivered to that dish,
and those could either
12320.42 be sperm that were
frozen previously,
12322.7 or more typically or ideally,
it would be live sperm collected
12326.21 that day that are
washed through a very
12329.27 straightforward procedure.
12331.04 And then those sperm
either are allowed
12333.23 to compete for those eggs
and fertilize those eggs
12335.87 and allow them to advance
to very early embryo stage
12339.71 before those embryos are
frozen and eventually implanted
12342.2 into a woman in order to have
them be carried to full term,
12346.5 ideally.
12347.18 Or there's a procedure in which
specific sperm are selected
12351.26 because they have the
best morphology, motility,
12353.45 and so forth.
12354.26 And in a process
called ICSI, I-C-S-I,
12357.68 in which the sperm themselves
are literally forced
12361.79 to fertilize that
particular egg.
12364.02 Now, under those conditions,
typically a couple or a woman,
12370.957 if she's doing this on her
own with a sperm donor,
12373.04 will get multiple
fertilized embryos
12376.61 that are carried to
a multicellular stage
12380.18 so that it's clear that
they could grow into a child
12383.45 if they were implanted
into a viable host--
12386.507 sometimes the surrogate,
sometimes the woman
12388.34 who wants the child herself.
12390.17 And under those
conditions, it is
12391.88 possible to look at
the genetic makeup,
12393.77 including the karyotype,
of those early nascent
12397.04 embryos, in which case
people really can select
12400.31 the sex of their offspring.
12401.48 That is, they will have
some embryos that are
12405.26 XX, some embryos that are XY.
12407.51 It's very likely,
also, that they
12409.01 will have some embryos that have
karyotypes or genotypes which
12413.24 are not ideal in that
they would potentially
12416.33 lead to a miscarriage or
some other genetic defect.
12418.58 And so, typically,
people do not select
12421.4 to implant those embryos
if they have the option
12425.12 to implant embryos that are
of either XX or XY karyotype
12430.49 and the normal
chromosomal arrangements
12433.67 for obvious reasons.
12436.07 So the whole point here is
that sex selection is possible,
12440.03 but only using
in-vitro fertilization.
12443.18 The other thing that
is becoming clear to us
12445.7 in more recent years is that
sex selection is actually
12449.3 possible at the level
of the sperm even prior
12451.97 to fertilization.
12453.21 This is an emerging data
set, and this is largely
12456.47 happening in clinics outside
of the United States.
12458.69 But there are some clinics
that have figured out methods
12461.12 in which they can
take a sperm sample
12463.19 and they can spin that
sperm sample in a centrifuge
12466.7 at a rate that separates
out the sperm into what
12469.4 are called different fractions.
12470.85 So for those of you who've
done a little bit of biology
12472.4 with centrifuge, it's when
you spin any kind of substance
12475.31 that includes multiple things
in it of different weights.
12478.165 When you spin them, the
things of different weights
12480.29 segregate out into
different fractions
12482.423 along the depth of the tube.
12483.59 And then you can take out
one fraction or the next
12485.81 simply with a little pipette.
12486.86 You take out the top
fraction, the middle fraction,
12488.985 and so forth.
12489.6 And what these clinics
have figured out
12491.24 is that if they spin the sperm
sample at the correct spin rate
12496.07 that the sperm
that will give rise
12499.1 to male offspring and the
sperm that will give rise
12502.67 to female offspring segregate
out into different fractions,
12505.73 allowing them to take each
of those fractions separately
12509.69 and to apply them to eggs, if
it's in-vitro fertilization,
12513.71 and give rise very reliably,
certainly much more
12517.13 than chance, to either
male or female embryos.
12521.39 They also, of course,
can choose to do
12523.76 this outside the context
of in-vitro fertilization.
12526.2 So some people are now opting
to have their sperm samples spun
12529.67 out in this way, separate
out the sperm that give rise
12532.85 to male or female
offspring, and then
12534.59 to only use the fraction
that they are interested in--
12538.59 so if they want a boy,
they'll use one fraction.
12540.59 If they want a girl, they'll
use different fraction--
12543.02 and then to use those fractions
in the context of what's
12546.65 called IUI, or intrauterine
insemination, which
12549.98 is, as the name suggests, rather
than having the man deliver
12554.0 the ejaculate with his penis
and the sperm with his penis,
12556.46 they have a device.
12557.99 The devices are now
commercially sold.
12559.89 Believe it or not, they're
sold over-the-counter
12561.89 and on the internet, so people
will even do this at home.
12564.21 And so what they're doing
is they'll take the sperm,
12566.377 and they'll do IUI in order
to bias the probability
12571.1 that they're going to get a
male or a female offspring.
12573.62 Again, this is something
that's now emerging.
12576.32 It's not commonplace.
12577.91 Most of the time, people simply
roll the dice, as it were,
12582.26 by having either intercourse
and just hoping for or not
12586.43 caring if they get a male
or a female offspring
12589.01 or, in the instance
of IVF, selecting
12591.05 male or female offspring,
sometimes largely
12593.18 on the basis of the
chromosomal arrangements.
12595.1 So of course, some
people might prefer
12598.79 to have one or the
other biological sex
12601.1 as their offspring.
12602.07 But of course, the healthy
chromosomal arrangements
12605.18 are going to be paramount
for getting a healthy child.
12608.03 And as I mentioned before,
unhealthy chromosomal
12611.24 arrangements or abnormal
chromosomal arrangements
12613.34 often lead to miscarriage
and/or birth defects.
12616.53 So selecting for healthy
chromosomal arrangements
12619.55 is always paramount,
but some people
12621.29 are selecting for
biological sex.
12622.88 And indeed, some couples
who can conceive naturally
12627.41 are opting for
IUI in order to be
12630.86 able to select biological
sex because of this ability
12633.74 to spin out the sperm samples
to different fractions
12637.04 and select the male
or female sperm.
12639.98 That is, the sperm
that would give rise
12641.63 to a male or female offspring.
12643.02 So this is a rapidly emerging
theme, believe it or not.
12646.98 Who knew?
12648.17 And of course, it has nothing to
do with Aristotle's assertions
12650.87 about what people are
thinking about at the point
12652.912 of ejaculation, nor
does it have anything
12654.86 to do with body position at
the point of ejaculation.
12657.86 But I do find it
rather interesting
12659.51 that, even in this
day and age, people
12662.21 seem to be continually
pursuing new and different ways
12665.87 to understand why one
sperm or another sperm
12668.57 happens to fertilize the egg.
12671.55 And when that information
is not available,
12673.99 because, frankly, it's
not available yet--
12675.74 we don't know why
a sperm containing
12677.96 a Y chromosome or a sperm
containing an X chromosome
12680.42 is more likely to
fertilize an egg.
12682.005 And there are some
ideas, for instance,
12683.63 that older fathers tend to
have more daughters as opposed
12686.15 to sons.
12686.767 But when you really look at
the data, it's pretty mixed.
12689.1 So if you've heard
that before, it
12691.607 has a particular nickname
that I'm not going
12693.44 to describe on the podcast.
12694.637 You can look it up online.
12695.72 But if any of you are aware
of any other kind of ideals
12699.8 or lore, no matter how
ridiculous or crazy, please
12702.328 put them in the comment
section on YouTube.
12704.12 I'd be very curious to learn
about those, mostly out
12707.09 of interest and curiosity.
12709.43 But, look, sometimes
these outrageous stories,
12712.34 such as notions of body
position and how they influence
12715.905 biological sex, even though
they turn out not to be true,
12718.28 turn out to be interesting
for other reasons.
12720.327 And in fact, next,
we're going to talk
12721.91 about how body position
during sexual intercourse
12724.55 can, in fact, influence
fertility and pregnancy.
12728.64 So another common theme
around fertility and pregnancy
12731.18 that you'll hear about
is that, for couples
12733.31 that are trying to get pregnant,
that during intercourse they
12737.21 should do whatever it
is that works for them,
12739.64 but then after
the man ejaculates
12743.18 that the woman should
try and position
12745.31 her ankles above her head
or somehow otherwise tilt
12750.23 her pelvis back in order
to increase the rate and/or
12754.19 probability that the
sperm swim toward the egg,
12757.59 as opposed to the
other direction.
12759.38 Now, I talked to a couple
of different OB/GYNs
12762.47 and urologists that are focused
on fertility about this topic,
12766.67 and it turns out you get
pretty mixed answers as to
12769.04 whether or not there's
any validity to this idea
12771.38 that the woman's body position
after the man ejaculates
12774.83 inside of her can
somehow influence
12777.38 the probability of pregnancy.
12778.85 One group of experts
told me that there
12781.16 is no reason for a woman
to need to continue
12783.56 to lie down, elevate the
ankles, or in any way
12787.04 tilt her pelvis back
in order to increase
12789.65 the probability of
successful fertilization.
12792.83 The other group suggested that
indeed there is a strong reason
12797.12 to believe that tilting the
pelvis back, maybe even keeping
12801.11 the ankles elevated,
and having a woman lie
12803.94 on her back for about 15 minutes
with the pelvis positioned
12807.99 at about 20 degrees back
is ideal for optimizing
12813.21 fertilization.
12813.815 I mean, they were
really specific
12815.19 about the recommendations.
12816.273 So I find this interesting that,
within the cohort of extremely
12820.89 well trained MDs, OB/GYNs
and urology fertility docs,
12825.51 and OB/GYNs, you see a split.
12827.58 It has nothing to do
with whether or not
12829.29 the physician was male or
female or their training
12832.92 or their institution,
none of that.
12834.59 There just seemed to be a sort
of even split between the two.
12836.74 Now, granted, it wasn't
the largest sample size
12838.5 that I could have obtained.
12839.625 And yet I do find it
interesting that there's
12842.09 this split in the
opinion about this.
12845.04 One group, the group that said,
no, pelvic position doesn't
12848.94 really matter, don't
worry about it,
12851.62 it's not going to influence
the rates of fertilization,
12854.46 argued that the sperm
swim very quickly
12857.595 and that if they are
released near the cervix
12859.47 they're going to swim very
quickly toward the egg
12862.08 in order to fertilize it
regardless of pelvic position.
12865.86 The other group said, well,
yes, sperm swim quickly
12870.09 and even if they're
released right at the entry
12872.91 to the cervix that the sperm
still have a long distance
12876.58 to go.
12877.08 Again, if you were to
scale this according
12879.36 to the size of the sperm versus
the size of a human body,
12882.57 an entire human body,
what you'd scale it to
12885.09 is the distance between Los
Angeles and San Francisco.
12887.34 And it needs to undergo that
basically within 24 hours
12889.77 or so.
12890.04 Although, as we
mentioned earlier,
12891.457 sperm can survive
quite a while inside
12894.09 of the woman's body-- maybe
three or five days at least.
12897.85 So in both cases
they acknowledge
12899.245 it's a long distance.
12900.12 But on the one hand,
you have a group
12901.83 of experts that are saying the
sperm more or less know what
12904.315 to do and are going
to do it regardless
12905.94 of the position of the woman
after ejaculation inside her
12909.06 and the other group
saying, no, we
12911.06 want to do everything
we can to bias
12912.6 the likelihood that the
sperm will fertilize the egg.
12916.17 Well, setting aside
the basic argument
12919.92 that tilting back at the pelvis
and lying stationary or so
12925.02 for about 15 minutes
after sexual intercourse
12928.35 and ejaculation is not
an expensive endeavor,
12933.69 although it requires
a little bit of time.
12936.21 And it forces people to
remain motionless or close
12939.42 to motionless, and they're not
up and around and moving about.
12942.69 Aside from that, it's a
relatively low investment.
12945.4 So one argument is,
well, if it could
12947.43 bias the likelihood of
fertilization at all
12950.82 and people want to get pregnant,
why wouldn't they do that?
12954.807 So that's a reasonable argument.
12956.14 But it doesn't really
point to the mechanism.
12958.41 The arguments that point to a
potential mechanism are that--
12961.518 if you recall what we were
talking about when we talked
12963.81 about sperm quality,
sperm quality
12966.055 involves a bunch of
different measures,
12967.68 like concentration of sperm
per milliliter of semen,
12971.25 morphology of those sperm,
how many are forward motile.
12974.61 It turns out that in any
one ejaculate sample,
12977.88 the total number of forward
motile and yet fast forward
12982.71 motile sperm that are also of
the highest quality morphology
12988.59 is actually quite low.
12990.37 And so the idea here
is that you want
12993.0 to get as many sperm
of the highest quality
12995.73 swimming toward the egg because
those sperm stand the highest
12999.03 probability of
fertilizing that egg.
13000.682 And in fact, this relates to
some of the discussion we were
13003.14 having earlier about behavioral
dos and don'ts for sake
13006.89 of increasing the
probability of fertilization.
13010.4 And the one that is most
important here is cannabis.
13013.91 It turns out that
the data on cannabis
13015.74 really do support the
idea that some of you
13018.5 may have heard from
parents and teachers--
13020.93 I don't know, I did hear this
from parents and teachers--
13023.72 that cannabis can disrupt
the swimming styles of sperm
13028.7 in ways that are not
supportive of fertilization,
13031.82 that it can turn more of
the sperm into twitchers.
13034.1 Although when I
learned about this,
13035.21 I was not informed of
the word "twitchers."
13037.002 What I was told is that,
if you use cannabis,
13040.1 that the sperm don't know
which direction to go,
13042.44 that they're confused,
almost implying
13045.2 that the sperm themselves
are high on cannabis.
13047.87 Well, that's certainly not the
argument that I'm making here.
13051.35 But it does seem to be
the case that people
13054.26 who use cannabis, even once,
the sperm that are generated
13058.63 during that particular month
or two months during which
13063.7 or after which they
use cannabis have
13066.19 less forward motility and
possibly altered morphology,
13070.87 as well.
13071.56 I want to be very
clear, I did not
13073.12 say that if you use cannabis
once you are forever
13075.79 disrupting the motility and
morphology of your sperm.
13079.36 I did not say that.
13080.17 What I said is that if
you use cannabis once,
13082.75 then the sperm that are
generated in the 60 days
13085.96 after that cannabis
use are going
13089.13 to have a higher incidence of
disrupted motility and perhaps
13092.83 morphology as well.
13094.84 Remember, sperm are continually
generated every 60 days or so.
13099.9 And so if you use cannabis
once, you are not forever
13103.26 disrupting your sperm.
13104.28 But if you are using
cannabis and then you
13106.53 are looking to conceive
in the next 60 days,
13108.87 you are going to be reducing,
we think significantly so,
13112.95 the number of quality
forwardly motile sperm.
13116.74 So the simple takeaway from
this is avoid cannabis use.
13119.52 Although if you are going
to use cannabis-- and again,
13121.95 there are medical
uses of cannabis
13124.17 and beneficial uses of cannabis
for certain populations.
13126.6 It can be bad for
other populations.
13128.41 We talked about that in
the Huberman Lab podcast
13130.53 all about cannabis.
13131.46 But if you're going
to use cannabis,
13133.11 you should try and abstain
from cannabis in the two months
13136.77 prior to the attempt to
fertilize and get pregnant.
13140.97 Now, I'm not aware
of any data on how
13143.58 cannabis use by the woman
can influence the likelihood
13147.0 of fertilization and pregnancy.
13148.59 And I want to couch this whole
discussion around cannabis
13151.052 under the umbrella of something
that came up in the episode
13153.51 that I did on cannabis,
which is that, for about half
13156.93 of people out there,
male and female--
13159.79 so here we're not distinguishing
by biological sex.
13163.71 About half of people
that use cannabis
13165.63 report it as an aphrodisiac.
13167.34 It makes them want to have
sexual intercourse more than
13170.595 if they don't use cannabis.
13171.72 And for the other
half, it actually
13173.64 has the opposite effect by way
of an influence on a hormone
13176.49 called prolactin,
which suppresses
13178.5 the dopamine system,
the testosterone,
13180.24 and the estrogenic system.
13182.29 And so this whole idea that
cannabis is an aphrodisiac
13185.19 seems to be true for about half
of the human population and not
13188.25 for the other half of
the human population.
13190.06 So I mention that because
I know a number of people
13192.66 use cannabis as an aphrodisiac.
13195.72 They like to use cannabis
before intercourse.
13197.61 It was actually very
surprising to me
13200.07 to discover when I
researched that cannabis
13202.2 episode that approximately
15% of women who are pregnant
13207.66 continue to use cannabis
during pregnancy.
13210.51 And that's a very
alarming statistic.
13212.7 And everything we know is
that the use of cannabis
13216.33 during pregnancy is detrimental
to the health and particularly
13219.6 the brain development
of the fetus.
13221.35 So that's a real concern.
13223.17 I highly recommend women
abstain from cannabis use
13225.93 during pregnancy.
13227.49 Talk to your OB/GYN about
it if you're using it all
13230.25 or considering using at all.
13231.63 So based on what I told
you earlier about the fact
13233.79 that cannabis use is not good
for egg quality and the fact
13238.23 that cannabis use can
disrupt the motility of sperm
13240.93 and therefore is not
good for sperm quality
13244.17 and it can disrupt the patterns
of swimming in sperm in ways
13247.74 that reduce the
likelihood of fertility,
13249.942 I think the take-home message
is clear, which is that
13252.15 whether or not you want
to be a cannabis user
13255.03 or not, if you are going
to try and conceive
13257.22 and certainly while
you're pregnant,
13258.72 you're going to want to
avoid the use of cannabis.
13260.97 And that is smoked cannabis
and vaped cannabis.
13263.97 And during pregnancy,
the consumption
13267.39 of cannabis even in edible
form or in tincture form
13270.06 is also going to be detrimental
to the developing fetus.
13272.88 But of course, we
started this conversation
13275.07 in the context of body
position, in particular
13278.1 at the point of
ejaculation, in determining
13280.2 the sex of the offspring and/or
the likelihood of getting
13284.61 a successful fertilization
in pregnancy.
13286.75 And I think that given that the
tilting back of the pelvis--
13290.97 so again, this is elevating the
pelvis by about 20 degrees--
13294.33 I don't think it has
to be exact, exact--
13296.31 but about 20 degrees for about
15 minutes post-ejaculation
13300.12 inside of the
woman-- or I suppose
13302.4 if people are using IUI,
intrauterine insemination.
13305.7 Since that seems to be the
consensus among those experts
13308.76 that believe that
pelvic tilt backward
13313.17 can be beneficial for
increasing the probability
13315.99 of fertilization and
given that it involves
13318.12 no cost but a little bit
of time seems to me that,
13320.557 if you want to get
pregnant, that that
13322.14 would be the right thing to do.
13323.577 And as far as I know,
there's no information
13325.41 nor was I able to obtain any
recommendations from experts
13328.98 about what the ideal
body position of the male
13331.77 is after ejaculation
if the goal is
13334.32 to increase the probability
of fertilization in pregnancy.
13337.45 So we've been talking about
behavioral interventions,
13339.66 some dos and some don'ts that
people can do to increase
13341.952 their fertility, and the
likelihood that any fertilized
13345.15 egg will be carried
to term successfully.
13347.67 And soon we'll also
talk about things
13349.68 that people can take to
improve their fertility.
13352.23 Now, keep in mind that
this entire discussion
13354.36 is about fertility.
13355.8 But also remember,
as we discussed
13358.05 at the beginning of
the episode, trying
13360.72 to increase your fertility
is one of the best ways
13364.2 to think about trying
to create and maintain
13367.29 optimal physical health.
13369.392 So for people that
are trying to conceive
13371.1 and for people who are
not trying to conceive,
13373.23 optimizing your fertility
status, whether or not
13375.51 you're male or female,
is one of the best ways
13378.03 to target those approaches.
13379.71 And there are now a lot of
data supporting the idea
13382.44 that acupuncture
of all things can
13384.96 be very beneficial for improving
both female and male fertility
13388.74 and, should a
woman get pregnant,
13390.93 for improving the quality
of outcomes-- that
13393.57 is, the likelihood
that there will
13395.46 be a successful pregnancy
that is carried to term,
13399.6 not premature, and
so on and so forth.
13402.312 Now, for some of
you out there, you
13403.77 might think, oh, of
course, acupuncture,
13405.27 acupuncture has been known to
work for thousands of years.
13407.687 And therefore,
it's not surprising
13410.25 that it would assist with
fertility and pregnancy.
13413.31 For many of you
out there, however,
13415.21 probably thinking,
acupuncture, that
13416.73 seems kind of like
fringe science.
13418.53 But what I can assure
you is that there are now
13421.05 quite a few clinical
trials funded
13423.42 by government agencies, like the
National Institutes of Health,
13426.72 showing that acupuncture is
a very effective treatment
13429.45 for a number of
different things,
13430.93 including fertility
and pregnancy,
13432.66 but for hormone status,
for stress relief,
13436.56 even for chronic illnesses
of different kinds,
13439.18 including autoimmune illnesses.
13440.68 So this is no longer
considered fringe science.
13443.02 In fact, one of the
best laboratories
13445.05 in the world working
on this is a laboratory
13447.21 out of Harvard Medical School
run by a guy named Qiufu Fu.
13450.9 Qiufu's lab has really been
exploring in a mechanistic way
13454.74 how the different
stimulation sites that
13457.08 are used in acupuncture--
so where the needles are
13459.21 inserted-- tap into
neural pathways that
13461.85 link the different
organs of the body.
13463.87 So for instance, they've
found that stimulation
13466.83 of a particular site
on the lower limb
13469.71 can reduce inflammation
dramatically
13472.08 throughout the body by
way of neural pathways
13475.17 that originate in the
lower limb and extend
13477.66 to areas such as the
kidney and the pancreas.
13479.95 So all these, quote,
unquote, "ancient maps"
13482.79 of the human body as they
relate to acupuncture
13484.95 are now being parsed at the
level of mechanism, which
13487.53 I think is wonderful because
it not only is showing us
13490.71 that so much of what has
been purported and reported
13494.19 in the landscape of
acupuncture actually
13496.74 has an underlying
mechanistic basis,
13498.72 and with additional mechanistic
understanding, of course,
13501.55 always arrive new
and better practices.
13503.77 That's the idea, to evolve
these fields of acupuncture,
13506.88 to evolve the fields of
mechanistic understanding
13508.98 of our biology and health.
13510.61 And so the issue of whether
or not acupuncture can assist
13514.59 in getting pregnant and in
carrying a child to term
13518.49 and for that child to
be healthy are really
13520.74 starting to emerge
in a major way.
13523.32 And rather than go
into all those data
13525.3 in detail, what I can
tell you is that there are
13527.64 clinical trials and data
supporting the fact that
13529.89 female fertility
itself can be supported
13532.05 by acupuncture through several
mechanisms, one of which
13536.25 is the balancing-- and I realize
that's a somewhat tricky term,
13539.335 and I'll define it
better in a moment--
13540.96 the balancing of hormones across
the ovulatory/menstrual cycle,
13546.13 including regulating
levels of FSH
13548.19 so that they're not
too high nor too low
13550.32 and restricting the
FSH to the follicular
13553.23 phase of the menstrual cycle,
as well as using acupuncture
13558.63 to improve things
like blood flow
13560.79 and the health of
the ovary itself
13562.62 and other aspects of the
female reproductive axis.
13565.71 So acupuncture can operate at
the chemical level, impacting
13569.68 hormones.
13570.18 It can act at the
mechanical level,
13572.46 impacting the different tissues
through which the egg has
13575.46 to pass and so on and so forth.
13577.05 Likewise, on the male
side, acupuncture
13579.63 has been shown to improve
semen volume, quality of sperm,
13584.4 sperm motility, et
cetera, and in large part
13588.03 through changes in the
neural pathways that
13590.76 innervate the very tissues and
vascular input to the scrotum
13595.92 and testicles, because,
as we learned earlier,
13598.77 temperature regulation of
the scrotum and testicles
13600.9 is so vital for
getting healthy sperm
13603.51 and increasing sperm quality.
13605.41 In addition, there are good
data to support the idea
13608.34 that acupuncture can increase
levels of testosterone,
13611.708 free testosterone, and
the sorts of hormones that
13613.75 are going to support healthy
hormone production and sperm
13617.2 production in males.
13619.18 And this is distinct from
applying testosterone
13623.29 from an exogenous source.
13624.61 So when we're talking about
acupuncture and increasing
13626.86 levels of testosterone, we're
talking about increasing levels
13629.402 of endogenous testosterone.
13631.03 So those Leydig cells can
support the Sertoli cells,
13633.7 and the Sertoli cells can make
that androgen-binding protein,
13636.34 and you get enhanced
spermatogenesis.
13638.62 You can find evidence for all
of these different features,
13641.08 both changes to the
chemical milieu-- that
13642.85 is, the hormones-- and changes
to the mechanical milieu,
13645.34 including, for instance,
improvement of the pathways
13648.64 leading from the seminiferous
tubules to the epididymis
13651.16 to the vas deferens, basically
clearing out the plumbing so
13653.95 that more quality
ejaculate can be delivered,
13656.14 which, of course, is going
to increase the probability
13658.39 of fertilization.
13659.84 So when you hear
that acupuncture
13661.45 can improve the
likelihood of pregnancy,
13663.94 that's an accurate statement for
which there are now increasing
13666.67 amounts of mechanistic data.
13668.62 If you want to learn more
about how acupuncture
13670.9 can be used to contribute
to improved fertilization
13673.84 and pregnancy,
there are a number
13675.58 of different excellent
reviews on this,
13677.65 both as it relates to females
and as it relates to males.
13681.53 One of the best papers
that I happen to like
13683.98 is one that we'll
provide a link to
13685.527 in the references entitled
"Acupuncture and Herbal
13687.61 Medicine for Female Fertility,
An Overview of Systematic
13690.58 Review," so a review of reviews.
13693.4 This was published
recently in 2021.
13696.242 We'll provide a link to that.
13697.45 And there's also going to
be a link to a review that
13701.08 relates to acupuncture for
male fertility and hormone
13704.11 augmentation.
13705.1 I should just mention
briefly that if you're
13707.35 going to look at
scientific papers,
13709.51 one thing that you'll
want to consider
13711.28 is also looking at the
references that they reference.
13713.748 Now, of course, papers tend to
reference a ton of references,
13716.29 in particular in reviews.
13717.435 So what you'll
want to do is look
13718.81 for the references
that are showing up
13720.7 most often in the introduction.
13722.77 Those references
often are going to be
13724.9 the most prominent recent
reviews or the most important
13728.17 findings in recent years.
13729.52 That's not always the case,
but that's often the case.
13731.96 So if you read the first couple
of paragraphs of these papers--
13734.585 and these are openly available
as full text, by the way,
13737.18 online if you go
to these links--
13738.61 you'll be able to access the
best papers, the most relevant
13742.0 papers, in the context
of acupuncture supporting
13744.94 female and acupuncture
supporting male fertility
13748.63 and hormone status.
13749.68 Now, I'd like to discuss things
that both men and women can
13752.74 take in order to
maximize their fertility.
13755.32 And again and again, when
we're talking about fertility,
13759.56 we're talking about people
who want to conceive and have
13762.26 children, but also we're
talking about a basic measure
13766.58 of overall health status.
13768.06 So if you're somebody who does
not want to conceive children,
13770.96 I still encourage you to
think about whether or not
13773.57 you would want to
do certain things
13775.04 or not do certain
things in order
13777.11 to maximize your fertility as a
means to maximize your vitality
13781.28 and longevity,
because that's really
13782.84 what maximizing fertility is
about for a lot of people.
13786.05 That said, I know
a lot of people
13787.61 would like to conceive
children, perhaps not right away
13789.99 but in the future.
13790.85 And what I'm about
to describe are
13792.5 some tools and
interventions that is things
13795.11 that one can take in order to
improve their hormone status
13800.09 but also, in particular,
the quality of their eggs
13803.15 and the quality of their sperm
in the short and long term.
13806.52 The first on the list of things
that people can take in order
13809.36 to improve egg quality or
sperm quality is L-carnitine.
13813.26 L-carnitine is present
in various foods,
13815.63 in particular in red meats.
13817.31 But again, it's going
to be very hard to get
13819.32 sufficient levels of L-carnitine
to improve egg quality
13821.9 and sperm quality, the
unless you're going
13823.67 to take it in supplement form.
13825.05 The typical recommendation,
based on peer-reviewed studies
13828.29 that have shown significant
improvements in egg quality--
13830.84 that is chromosomal
arrangements,
13833.09 that is the likelihood of
fertility-- or pregnancy,
13835.91 rather--
13836.45 the likelihood of
sperm being forward
13839.3 fast swimmers as opposed
to twitchers or immotile
13841.55 and having proper morphology--
all those measures
13843.71 has been demonstrated to
be significantly improved
13847.37 by the ingestion of L-carnitine.
13848.87 How much L-carnitine?
13850.04 Well, that depends on how you're
obtaining the L-carnitine.
13852.53 If you're obtaining
it in capsule form,
13856.01 1 to 3 grams per day of
capsule form L-carnitine
13860.36 is what's been suggested to
improve egg quality and sperm
13863.39 quality.
13864.05 Now, 1 to 3 grams per day
can be taken all at once
13867.29 or spread out throughout
the 24-hour cycle.
13869.33 It can be taken with
or without food.
13871.865 It does not seem to matter.
13873.78 And when taken for a
period of 30 to 60 days,
13877.61 it does seem to
significantly improve
13879.56 all the parameters that
have been discussed for egg
13881.93 quality and sperm quality.
13883.64 Now, the mechanism for that
effect is pretty clear.
13886.16 L-carnitine is involved in the
processing of lipids, fats,
13891.53 in terms of
mitochondrial function.
13894.21 And as we talked about
before, mitochondria
13896.42 are vital for the organization
and action of the spindle that
13900.56 pulls apart the
chromosomes, taking
13902.21 that cell within the female
from diploid to haploid,
13906.26 which is essential.
13907.37 You really want just the 23
individual chromosomal strands.
13911.12 You don't want
chromosomal repeats.
13913.64 It's also involved in the
actual fusion of the egg
13916.79 as it exits the ovary and
enters the ovulation cycle.
13921.022 Mitochondria are also important,
as we talked about before,
13923.48 for the forward motility
of sperm because
13925.22 of the enrichment
of mitochondria
13926.595 in that mid region
just behind the head.
13928.28 They cause the
whipping flagellation
13930.62 of the tail, allowing
for forward movement,
13932.93 as well as other aspects
of cellular morphology.
13935.31 So it makes a lot of sense as to
why L-carnitine supplementation
13938.847 would be beneficial.
13939.68 Again, it's 1 to 3 grams per
day over a period of about 30
13942.76 to 60 months.
13943.453 If you're hoping to conceive
in the upcoming months,
13945.62 recommend taking it for at
least 30 days prior to that.
13949.31 Of course, based on the data
we talked about before--
13952.1 cumulative probability,
fecundability,
13954.08 et cetera-- there's
no reason to not
13955.73 continue to try for
pregnancy before taking
13957.74 L-carnitine, but L-carnitine is
going to improve egg and sperm
13961.07 quality.
13961.64 And so you might actually
take the stance that,
13965.66 even if you don't have any
problem getting pregnant,
13968.42 wouldn't you want to
maximize the quality
13970.94 of the egg that gets fertilized
and the quality of the sperm
13973.73 that fertilizes that egg?
13975.27 So that's additional rationale
for taking L-carnitine.
13978.29 One important note--
if you are going
13980.45 to take L-carnitine in
oral form, in capsule form,
13983.66 it can increase
something called TMAO.
13986.03 TMAO can cause stiffening
of the arteries.
13988.43 You don't want TMAO
levels to go too high.
13990.8 One way to offset the
increases in TMAO caused
13993.68 by oral L-carnitine is
to take 600 milligrams
13996.95 of garlic per day.
13998.602 I suppose you could
eat cloves of garlic.
14000.31 That would work just as
well because garlic contains
14002.26 something called
allicin, which can
14003.82 offset the increase in TMAO.
14006.01 But 600 milligram capsules
of garlic are going to be--
14009.55 or garlic extract, rather--
14011.78 is going to be the most probably
cost effective and simplest way
14016.3 to do this.
14017.17 And also, they are going to
create that garlic smell.
14019.388 Some people like
the smell of garlic.
14020.93 Some people don't.
14021.68 So if you're going to
take oral L-carnitine,
14023.62 I suggest also
taking 600 milligrams
14025.72 a day of garlic extract.
14027.985 And you can do that at any
time throughout the day.
14030.11 It doesn't have to be
with the L-carnitine.
14032.442 The next item on the list of
compounds that have been shown
14034.9 to improve egg quality
and sperm quality--
14037.03 and quite robustly so--
14038.98 is coenzyme Q10.
14040.6 Coenzyme Q10 is something
that you can actually measure
14043.45 levels of in your blood.
14045.183 Most physicians
will say that they
14046.6 want to see your
levels of coenzyme Q10
14048.4 to be somewhere
between 0.5 and 2.5.
14050.673 It's going to
depend on the units.
14052.09 Most people, I
realize, are not going
14053.632 to run off and get
their CoQ10 measured.
14055.75 It's not included in most
standard blood tests.
14057.82 But if you were to
measure your CoQ10,
14059.5 that's the range that
you want to look for.
14061.63 That said, many people opt
to supplement with CoQ10.
14065.08 And you'll find that many
fertility docs, OB/GYNs,
14068.56 and urologists that are trying
to assist their male patients
14071.08 with fertility
will suggest CoQ10
14072.7 because, again, it supports
the health of mitochondria.
14076.18 Mitochondria are so vital to so
many aspects of the formation
14080.53 and fertilization of
the egg and sperm that,
14085.27 of course, fertilizes the egg.
14087.58 The coenzyme Q10 dosages
that are most often suggested
14091.0 and that you'll observe in
the peer-reviewed research
14094.15 literature-- on
humans, I should add--
14096.13 is 100 to 400
milligrams per day.
14099.55 And the coenzyme Q10
is taken generally
14102.49 with a meal and ideally
a meal that contains fat.
14105.61 And there's even some idea
that taking coenzyme Q10
14108.82 with your dinner, assuming that
dinner includes some fat-- you
14112.773 don't have to add
additional fat--
14114.19 is going to be more advantageous
than taking coenzyme Q10 early
14117.85 in the day, although
that's probably
14119.35 a detail that's getting a little
too far down in the weeds.
14121.808 So again, 100 to 400 milligrams
of coenzyme Q10 per day,
14124.9 whether or not you're
a man or a woman,
14126.61 for improving the
likelihood of fertility
14129.31 by way of improving
egg and sperm quality.
14131.56 And again, if you're somebody
who just doesn't have
14133.685 any problem getting pregnant
or if you're already producing
14136.33 many sperm of
quality morphology,
14138.467 this is another case in which
you could take a step back
14140.8 and say, well, why wouldn't
I want to further optimize
14143.26 the quality of the
egg and the sperm,
14144.55 because the quality of
the egg and the sperm
14145.96 ultimately are
going to determine
14147.64 not just whether or not you
have a successful pregnancy
14149.95 but are going to determine,
admittedly in ways that will
14154.22 forever remain cryptic
to you-- but nonetheless
14156.62 are going to be
important in determining
14158.54 the qualities of the
brain tissue and body
14161.21 tissue of your offspring.
14162.71 The third item on the list of
compounds which are commonly
14165.5 suggested or prescribed
by fertility docs
14169.7 nowadays for men
and women wishing
14171.23 to conceive and/or
optimize their fertility
14173.48 as a basis for general vitality
and health is inositol.
14177.74 Now, inositol has many uses.
14179.85 So you'll hear about
the use of inositol
14181.52 for reducing anxiety
or improving mood
14183.663 or even for the
treatment of depression.
14185.33 We talked about inositol
in previous episodes
14187.37 of this podcast.
14188.81 For instance, I
talked about inositol
14191.51 and in particular taking 900
milligrams of myo-inositol
14195.29 prior to sleep, which
is something that I do,
14197.48 along with the other supplements
that I take and recommend
14200.33 for sleep, such as magnesium 3
and 8, apigenin, and theanine.
14204.313 If you're curious
about those, you
14205.73 can see our newsletter on sleep
or our "Perfect Your Sleep"
14208.16 episode or the "Master
Your Sleep" episode.
14209.75 It talks about behavioral and
supplementation-based tools
14212.125 for improving sleep.
14213.11 But myo-inositol is not just
suggested for or prescribed
14218.21 for people that are
wishing to get pregnant
14221.21 and for general health.
14222.59 But myo-inositol is
often recommended
14225.32 for people that want to improve
egg and sperm quality because
14229.49 of the way that
it can positively
14230.99 impact insulin sensitivity.
14232.85 Insulin sensitivity might sound
like a bad thing to people
14236.0 out there.
14236.58 But it turns out that you
want to be insulin sensitive.
14239.84 The last thing you want is
to be insulin insensitive.
14242.48 Insulin insensitivity is
associated with type 2
14244.55 diabetes, with obesity,
and even for people
14246.83 who are not challenged
with obesity,
14249.53 you want your cells to
be insulin sensitive.
14251.867 You don't want a lot of insulin
floating around in your system
14254.45 with your cells unable
to use that insulin.
14257.87 That's really what insulin
insensitivity is about.
14260.15 Myo-inositol, at dosages
of 1 to 5 grams per day--
14265.342 that's pretty high,
1 to 5 grams per day,
14267.05 keeping in mind that 1,000
milligrams is 1 gram--
14270.2 has been suggested to improve
egg quality and sperm quality.
14273.83 Now, one point of--
14275.63 I wouldn't say
caution-- but of note
14277.22 is that myo-inositol
can reduce anxiety,
14279.927 and it can be a
slight sedative, which
14281.51 is why some folks, including
myself, take almost a gram, 900
14285.5 milligrams, prior to sleep.
14287.69 If you're going to take
5 grams of myo-inositol,
14290.84 you would want to restrict
that to the late evening
14293.315 or second half of your day.
14294.44 And I don't suggest
starting that high.
14296.065 I would start with 1
or 2 grams and then
14297.95 working your way
up, seeing what you
14299.45 can tolerate in terms of
the level of anti-anxiety
14303.5 and drowsiness that it produces.
14306.26 1 to 5 grams per
day of myo-inositol
14308.75 is what's suggested for both
men and women wishing to improve
14312.89 egg health and sperm health.
14314.18 But for women, it's also often
suggested to include also--
14319.04 so to take myo-inositol, but
to also take D-chiro inositol.
14323.6 D-chiro inositol
has elements in it
14326.69 that can be both pro
and anti-androgenic.
14330.11 Androgens are things like
testosterone and related
14332.42 molecules.
14333.44 There are a number of
different causes of infertility
14336.35 and disruption to egg
quality, age being the most
14339.44 significant factor.
14340.55 But another significant
and very common
14343.13 factor, even among young
women who are of fertile age,
14346.73 is having too many androgens
and as it relates to something
14350.36 called polycystic
ovarian syndrome.
14352.37 We'll do an entire episode
about menopause and PCOS
14354.775 and a number of
other things that
14356.15 relate to fertility because
it's an entire and very
14359.78 interesting other discussion
that we need to have.
14362.19 But the recommendation
is that women
14363.71 take 1 to 5 grams
of myo-inositol
14366.26 but also D-chiro inositol
because of the ways
14370.16 that it can balance
androgens and offset some
14373.07 of the negative effects of
polycystic ovarian syndrome
14376.31 or even for women who do
not have polycystic ovarian
14378.92 syndrome because of the ways
that D-chiro inositol can
14381.83 balance androgens in
ways that are beneficial.
14384.71 The dosages of D-chiro
inositol that are recommended
14388.55 tend to be 1/25 to 1/40
of the myo-inositol dose.
14393.01 So you'll have to get
out your calculator.
14394.76 Remember, 1,000
milligrams equals 1 gram.
14396.95 So figure out, if you're
taking 1 gram of myo-inositol
14399.74 per day or 2 grams,
you're going to want
14402.11 to convert that to milligrams.
14403.76 So let's say you're taking 2
grams of myo-inositol per day.
14407.18 That's 2,000 milligrams.
14408.38 Then you'd want to
divide that by 25.
14410.75 And that's how many
milligrams of D-chiro inositol
14413.96 you would want to take, as well.
14415.59 Or you could go with the lower
end dose and divide it by 40
14418.73 and take that number of
milligrams of D-chiro inositol
14423.08 along with the inositol.
14424.31 Again, probably taking it later
in the day is going to be good.
14427.16 And it's not clear
at all that taking it
14429.373 with food or without food makes
any difference whatsoever.
14431.79 So I would suggest
you do either.
14433.67 Keep in mind, as I'm discussing
these recommendations,
14436.26 I may call them prescriptions.
14437.51 But none of these are
prescription drugs.
14439.218 And of course, you should
always discuss any supplements
14441.74 that you're planning to take or
stop taking, for that matter,
14444.8 with your physician.
14445.67 I don't say that to protect me.
14446.962 I say that to protect you.
14448.107 Any time you're going
to add or change
14449.69 something in your
overall health regimen,
14451.398 you want to discuss that
with your trusted health care
14454.2 professional, typically, I would
hope, a board-certified MD.
14457.5 The fourth item in the list of
commonly suggested supplements
14461.55 for men and women wishing to
optimize egg and sperm quality,
14465.36 respectively, is
omega-3 fatty acids.
14468.477 And now, here, we're
talking about something
14470.31 that could be obtained from food
and can be obtained from food.
14472.935 So if you're consuming
fatty ocean fish, things
14475.89 like sardines, anchovies,
salmon with the skin,
14479.19 chances are you're going to
get some quality omega-3s.
14482.61 Omega-3s are also available
in plant-based sources.
14485.65 It's also available in
krill, for that matter.
14487.98 But most people find
it difficult to reach
14489.93 the threshold required
for optimizing
14493.2 mental health and
physical health
14494.61 that is the threshold of the
EPA essential fatty acids.
14497.83 And so for that
matter, I've suggested
14500.07 before on this podcast--
14501.27 and many fertility
docs will suggest--
14503.31 that their patients take omega-3
fatty acids in supplement form.
14508.22 It could be taken in liquid
form or in capsule form,
14510.56 but enough of those that you're
getting at least 1 gram per day
14513.95 of the EPA form of omega-3,
so at least 1 gram per day
14517.82 and as high as 2 or even 3
grams per day of the EPA form.
14521.625 So you'll need to
look at the packaging
14523.25 because oftentimes it'll
say high potency omega-3.
14525.86 It'll say 1,500
milligrams of omega-3s.
14530.06 But that's not 1,500
milligrams of the EPA form.
14533.028 You look on the back of
the label, and it'll say,
14535.07 each serving contains
750 milligrams of EPA.
14538.88 You want to get above
that 1 gram dosage per day
14542.12 and as high as 3 grams
per day of the EPAs.
14545.06 The most cost-effective
way to do
14546.47 that is going to be
liquid-form omegas,
14548.652 but that's a little bit
inconvenient for many people,
14550.86 and some people
don't like the taste.
14552.402 That's why they rely on
the capsule-form omegas.
14554.66 And of course,
there are compounds
14556.31 that can impact
fertility status, quality
14558.92 of eggs, quality of sperm,
not by adjusting mitochondria
14562.55 or insulin sensitivity
or creating
14565.01 a general milieu of support
for the egg and the sperm
14568.46 production and function, such
as the compounds that I just
14572.6 listed off do, but
rather compounds
14576.28 that influence the
hormones involved
14578.17 in the generation of sperm and
the generation of the eggs,
14580.72 involved in the ovulatory cycle
and the spermatogenesis cycle,
14584.02 that is.
14584.74 Now, these are going to
come in different forms.
14587.57 And I want to just emphasize
that the supplements that
14590.83 do this, that adjust
hormones in these ways that
14592.9 can be beneficial, are
distinct from hormone therapy
14596.35 or bioidentical hormones,
distinct from hormone therapy
14599.733 or bioidentical
hormones, because,
14601.15 as we discussed
earlier, when you take
14603.88 a hormone like testosterone or
even estrogen, for that matter,
14606.59 from an exogenous,
an outside source,
14608.38 you're going to disrupt
the feedback pathways
14610.797 inside of your body, and
you're going to shut down
14612.88 your own endogenous production.
14614.65 The supplements I'm about
to describe do not do that
14618.31 and yet can adjust levels of
hormones in more subtle ways
14621.7 that can be beneficial for the
process of maximizing fertility
14626.29 for males and for females.
14627.85 The first of which on this
list that I'd like to discuss
14630.305 has been discussed
in previous podcasts
14631.93 as well, which is a
substance called tongkat ali.
14634.63 Tongkat ali also
goes by other names.
14637.42 But when taken at 400
milligrams per day,
14640.03 sometimes separated
into two dosages
14641.59 but typically taken as
once a day early in the day
14644.92 because they can be a little
bit stimulating, although not
14648.28 anxiety provoking--
14649.12 I've never heard of that.
14650.362 It can be a little
bit stimulating.
14651.82 But 400 milligrams
a day of tongkat ali
14653.71 has been shown to
increase free testosterone
14656.608 by way of reducing something
called sex hormone binding
14658.9 globulin.
14659.4 It's also been shown to
increase luteinizing hormone,
14661.9 the net effect of which
has been described
14664.57 as a subtle but significant
increase in libido
14668.65 and some of the other parameters
associated with increased
14671.86 androgens, like free
testosterone in males
14673.84 and females.
14674.35 So a number of people out
there are taking tongkat ali
14676.6 in this way--
14677.142 400 milligrams per
day, restricted
14678.61 to the early part of the
day, with or without food.
14682.45 People always ask, do you
need to cycle tongkat ali?
14684.88 I'm not aware of any need
to cycle tongkat ali.
14687.07 In fact, it tends
to work better,
14688.75 meaning the effects on libido
and some other hormone profiles
14692.11 tend to increase over time.
14693.82 Again, tongkat ali is an option.
14696.31 Certainly, none of these
things are requirements.
14698.44 We're simply
listing off options.
14699.97 But many people, both
males and females,
14702.22 seem to benefit from
and like tongkat ali,
14705.34 even if they're not
seeking to conceive.
14707.53 There's no reason to think
that tongkat ali directly
14709.9 improves sperm quality.
14711.49 Except in males, the increase in
androgen created by tongkat ali
14715.12 supplementation can indeed lead
to improved spermatogenesis.
14718.93 So there's a growing amount
of data in the research
14721.627 literature on tongkat ali.
14722.71 Many people find it beneficial.
14724.34 And so it's something that
both men and women wishing
14726.61 to conceive and/or optimize
their fertility just
14729.01 as a general health parameter
might want to explore.
14731.86 The other supplement that's
been shown to improve both egg
14735.64 quality and sperm quality--
14738.46 and there I'm
referring to a number
14739.937 of different parameters related
to egg quality and sperm
14742.27 quality--
14742.9 as well as to increase
libido fairly substantially
14746.92 is a substance called Shilajit.
14748.87 Shilajit, spelled
S-H-I-L-A-G-I-T--
14753.55 Shilajit is actually
a compound that's
14757.18 used in ayurvedic
medicine, but there
14759.04 are some really good
research studies exploring
14761.5 the supplementation with
Shilajit at about 250
14765.34 milligrams twice per day.
14767.12 And this has been looked
at in males and in females.
14769.66 And it does seem to
significantly increase
14771.97 two hormones.
14772.93 One is testosterone,
and the other
14775.12 is follicle-stimulating hormone.
14777.43 And for that reason, Shilajit
is often considered a tonic
14781.06 that people use both as an
aphrodisiac to increase libido
14785.53 as well as to
increase fertility.
14788.08 Now, one note of caution,
if you're a woman
14790.99 and you're considering
taking Shilajit in order
14792.983 to increase testosterone and
follicle-stimulating hormone,
14795.4 keep in mind that
the ovulatory cycle
14797.08 is this very tightly
regulated cycle in which you
14801.28 want low but elevated levels
of follicle-stimulating hormone
14805.3 early in the
follicular phase, then
14807.01 it peaks right before
ovulation, and then low levels
14810.087 of follicle-stimulating
hormone in the second half
14812.17 of your cycle.
14812.77 For that reason, using
Shilajit chronically
14815.8 around the entire course
of your ovulatory cycle
14818.74 could be a little
bit risky, and I'd
14820.24 recommend that you talk to
your OB/GYN prior to doing that
14824.38 or if doing that at all.
14826.72 For males, it's a little
bit less of an issue,
14828.67 because, as I mentioned
earlier, sperm are constantly
14830.878 being generated, and
the presence of FSH
14833.83 is going to increase
spermatogenesis.
14836.32 Now, Shilajit is not FSH itself.
14839.23 Shilajit stimulates
the release of FSH.
14842.26 And it stimulates the
release of testosterone.
14844.24 So again, there's
no reason to think
14845.74 that it would shut down your
endogenous testosterone or FSH
14848.56 production.
14849.91 Although there are limited
amount of data that really
14852.4 explore that in detail.
14853.78 Many people use
Shilajit in order
14856.57 to increase their
testosterone, FSH,
14858.82 their libido, and various
aspects of sperm health.
14863.95 Again, the dosages of Shilajit
are about 250 milligrams,
14866.83 two times per day.
14867.67 One issue with
Shilajit is it often
14869.14 comes as a tar, which is a
little hard to measure out
14872.11 the dosages.
14872.86 Yes, a tar.
14873.94 It's this kind of
thick, gummy substance
14876.04 that you're supposed
to dissolve in water.
14877.79 And the recommendations
are you take a little bead
14879.873 and dissolve it in water.
14881.04 It is available in
capsule form where
14882.71 the ability to
control the dosage
14885.56 is made a little bit easier.
14886.95 But of course, as
with any supplement,
14888.65 I recommend starting with
the lowest possible dosage.
14891.08 So you might want to start with
a very small bead of Shilajit
14894.8 dissolved in water,
taken once per day,
14896.79 and then increase
the dosage as needed
14898.85 in order to obtain the
effects that you want.
14901.4 Things like Shilajit
start to bring us
14903.5 into the realm of
what can only be
14905.33 described as a little
bit unwieldy, right?
14907.1 Here we're saying you can't
really control the dosage.
14908.99 Now you're talking
about hormones
14910.365 that need to be tightly
regulated, at least for females
14912.77 across the ovarian cycle.
14913.91 For males, yes,
it has been shown
14915.59 to increase
testosterone and FSH,
14917.72 improve sperm motility and sperm
count pretty significantly.
14921.65 No reason to think that you
couldn't do that chronically
14923.99 with Shilajit.
14924.65 And yet, I do want to
acknowledge that Shilajit,
14927.44 as this black tar
substance, contains
14929.99 a lot of different things.
14931.2 In fact, it comes
from a mineral pitch.
14933.14 What is that?
14933.76 It comes from literally
the dirt and plants
14936.2 that have been compressed
by rocks in the Himalayas.
14938.56 So that's pretty esoteric
stuff when it really
14940.622 comes down to it.
14941.33 But the biological
effects of Shilajit,
14943.7 in both males and females,
seem to be related to the fact
14946.49 that it is highly enriched in
something called folic acid,
14949.46 and folic acid is
involved in a lot
14951.17 of different cellular processes,
not the least of which,
14953.78 at least in this context, is
the transport of molecules
14957.92 across cell membranes.
14959.337 And for hormones to
have their effect,
14960.92 they need to cross cell
membranes on the outside
14962.92 and the inside of the cell.
14964.588 So maybe that's how
it's having its effect.
14966.38 Again, the mechanisms of
exactly how Shilajit increases
14969.92 testosterone and FSH and
thereby libido, egg quality,
14973.31 and sperm quality
aren't entirely clear.
14975.32 But for the more
adventurous of you out there
14978.068 who want to experiment
with Shilajit,
14979.61 whether or not you're
trying to conceive or not,
14982.43 it might be something
to consider.
14983.87 But of course, do talk
to your physician.
14985.7 The next compound that I
want to discuss is zinc.
14988.91 And this discussion
mainly pertains to males,
14991.31 although I, of course,
should point out
14993.26 that females should get the
recommended daily allowance
14996.74 of zinc each day.
14998.0 Males, on the other
hand, seem to benefit
15000.58 from having additionally
high levels of zinc intake.
15004.163 Now, that can be
obtained through foods.
15005.83 You often hear, oh, oysters
are enriched in zinc,
15008.62 and oysters are an aphrodisiac.
15011.205 I don't know who's doing
the marketing for oysters,
15013.33 but it's really terrific.
15015.08 I think that seems
to have persisted.
15016.69 And maybe it's true.
15019.51 Oysters are enriched in zinc.
15021.04 What does zinc do for fertility?
15023.87 Well, in males, we know,
based on a really nice set
15026.74 of studies, that
zinc dosages that
15029.23 are pretty high of
about 120 milligrams
15031.72 taken twice per day--
15033.73 that's quite a lot-- with
meals can significantly
15037.24 increase testosterone
and dihydrotestosterone.
15040.54 And this probably shouldn't
come as a surprise to us.
15042.86 It turns out that zinc is
highly enriched in human testes
15046.54 and in the testes
of other animals,
15048.2 including fish
and other mammals.
15049.72 And it was actually in 1921
that it was observed in fish
15054.76 that zinc levels skyrocket
in the testes of fish
15058.54 during their breeding season.
15060.02 So zinc is correlated with
increases in breeding,
15062.973 but you never know
which direction
15064.39 that correlation is running.
15065.77 It turns out that
zinc in both animals,
15069.56 including fish, other mammals,
and in humans, strongly
15073.06 impacts the enzymatic
functions in the testes,
15075.55 including the function of
androgen-binding protein.
15078.8 So it seems that
high levels of zinc
15080.38 can increase spermatogenesis
and testosterone
15082.75 levels very significantly.
15085.193 This was explored in
a really nice study
15086.86 that I'll provide
a reference to.
15087.88 It's an older study.
15088.73 But I really like.
15089.56 It's called "Effect
of Zinc Administration
15091.31 on Plasma Testosterone,
Dihydrotestosterone,
15093.55 and Sperm Count."
15094.75 This is but just one
study among many now.
15098.29 This dates back to 1981,
but there have been studies
15101.41 subsequently that point to
the fact that supplementation
15103.81 with zinc at those
high levels can really
15105.518 be helpful in
terms of increasing
15108.4 sperm count,
testosterone, and even
15111.04 testicular size, of all things.
15113.03 So one important
point about taking
15115.75 zinc-- this 120 milligrams
of zinc two times daily
15119.225 definitely needs to
be done with meals.
15120.85 If you've ever taken
zinc on an empty stomach,
15122.92 even if you just take 15
or 30 milligrams of zinc,
15125.59 you can feel very nauseous,
not well, for a few hours.
15129.1 So make sure that you're
taking zinc with full meals.
15131.83 So this would mean that
you're taking in at least
15134.59 two full meals per day.
15137.83 I should also mention that
zinc supplementation did not
15140.26 appear to impact
gonadotropin-releasing hormone
15143.2 or prolactin.
15143.89 So it seems to be a
fairly targeted effect
15146.29 on the testosterone and
related pathways in males.
15148.84 As far as I know, there have
not been systematic explorations
15152.08 of the effects of high levels of
zinc administration on females.
15155.325 I would hope that those
studies would soon be done.
15157.45 But meanwhile, if
you're a male and you're
15159.28 interested in
improving sperm quality
15160.93 and your testosterone levels
overall for whatever reason,
15164.02 zinc likely is a good candidate.
15166.0 And that pretty much
summarizes the compounds
15168.28 that men and women
should take in order
15170.35 to maximize egg quality,
sperm quality, and fertility.
15173.157 And then, of course,
we start to enter
15174.74 the landscape of other things
that men and women can take
15177.5 in order to improve fertility,
and those other things
15180.26 generally are
prescription drugs.
15182.39 And so I just want to mention
what a few of those are.
15184.815 But of course, these are things
that you would absolutely
15187.19 have to obtain prescriptions
for from your MD,
15191.03 and your MD, without
question, would
15194.3 want to take blood tests prior
to prescribing these things.
15197.22 So for instance,
if men have been
15199.4 taking exogenous
testosterone through the use
15202.1 of anabolic steroids, like
performance-enhancing drugs
15204.56 or even testosterone
replacement therapy,
15206.54 their endogenous
testosterone levels
15208.19 are going to be very low,
and their sperm counts
15210.193 are going to be very low,
unless, for instance, they
15212.36 are prescribed and
taking something
15213.89 like hCG, human chorionic
gonadotropin, which
15217.55 mimics LH and would stimulate
the testes to produce
15220.16 testosterone and through
some indirect pathways rescue
15223.4 spermatogenesis, although
not to the same degree
15225.83 as if people are not
taking exogenous sources
15229.1 of testosterone.
15230.33 Some men, even if they've
never touched TRT or exogenous
15234.32 testosterone of any
kind, will be prescribed
15237.29 to take hCG because
of its ability
15239.42 to stimulate the
testes to produce
15241.31 more testosterone and sperm.
15242.7 So they're just
taking hCG alone.
15244.61 Other men will take--
15245.84 or will be prescribed, rather--
15247.43 FSH in order to stimulate
spermatogenesis, or hCG
15250.64 and FSH, or clomiphene,
which can regulate
15254.18 all sorts of things in
the both testosterone and
15256.49 estrogen-related pathways at
the level of brain and pituitary
15260.81 and gonad, testes.
15263.54 Likewise, for women,
if they're low in FSH,
15265.85 they might be prescribed FSH.
15267.77 If they are low in
luteinizing hormone,
15270.68 they might be prescribed hCG.
15272.15 If they're low in
testosterone, they might even
15273.71 be prescribed testosterone.
15274.85 And if their
testosterone is too high
15276.41 and they're dealing
with PCOS, they
15277.88 might be prescribed
anti-androgens and androgen
15280.82 blockers and on and on and on.
15283.32 There are so many
different hormones that
15285.26 can impact the different
aspects of the ovulatory
15287.6 and the spermatogenesis
cycle that the OB/GYNs
15291.95 and the urologists focused on
male fertility nowadays really
15295.04 have an excellent handle
on which levers and buttons
15297.83 and threads to pull and
push and so forth in order
15300.59 to set in motion
a proper ovulatory
15303.14 cycle and a proper
spermatogenesis cycle.
15306.08 Everything we talked
about up until now
15308.305 and in the early
phase of this episode,
15309.93 especially, about how
the brain commands
15312.92 the pituitary and the pituitary
commands the gonads and then
15315.89 the gonads, the
ovary, or the testes
15317.72 send feedback signals
to the pituitary
15320.0 to then influence
the pituitary, all
15321.98 of that incredible
orchestra, that dance,
15324.44 is so tightly regulated in
a way that really provides
15327.92 the OB/GYNs and
the fertility docs
15329.99 concerned with male fertility
exceptional tools to,
15333.26 for instance, figure out if a
man is not producing any sperm
15336.86 but his testosterone levels
are well within normal range,
15340.28 well, then there are some very
clear sets of explorations
15343.018 and potential treatments.
15344.06 Some of which are
mechanical, making sure
15345.768 the epididymis and vas
deferens are clear,
15347.69 allowing the sperm to
enter the ejaculate
15349.79 and the ejaculate
to enter the urethra
15351.47 and obviously to enter
the female, as well
15355.93 as for a woman
who's not ovulating
15357.88 to adjust her levels of FSH or
maybe even to apply acupuncture
15362.65 in conjunction with
supplementation
15364.39 and various prescription
hormone therapies to adjust
15367.87 fertility and ovulation
and the probability
15370.06 of successful pregnancy.
15371.93 So there's a vast landscape
of prescription drugs
15374.56 and surgical interventions
of varying degrees
15377.35 of invasiveness.
15379.33 And some are, for instance,
outpatient procedures.
15383.14 Some require general
anesthesia, et cetera,
15385.27 in order to maximize male
and female fertility.
15388.39 What I've tried to do
today is to provide you
15391.81 with a deep dive understanding
of the ovulatory and menstrual
15396.39 cycle.
15396.89 We talked about the brain,
the pituitary, the ovary,
15398.71 the Fallopian
tubes, and, in fact,
15400.13 the whole female
reproductive axis
15401.77 as it relates to
fertility and reproduction
15406.15 I also describe the male
reproductive axis as it relates
15410.62 to the brain, the pituitary,
the gonad, the testes,
15413.2 and the various
ducts, the pathways,
15415.18 out of the testes that allow
the sperm to be enriched
15419.8 within the semen and then
the semen and the ejaculate
15422.29 to exit through the urethra.
15424.15 I did all that as a way
to frame the various tools
15426.85 and interventions
that can really
15429.07 assist in increasing fertility,
egg quality, and sperm quality.
15433.4 So when we discuss
mitochondria in the context
15435.58 of the development of an egg
or the development of sperm
15438.61 and its ability to
swim quickly forward,
15441.7 now it should make
sense as to why
15443.62 give an intervention,
whether or not
15445.12 it's L-carnitine
or whether or not
15446.537 it's exercise or whether or
not it's getting enough sleep
15448.912 and limiting stress, why all
that should matter and why,
15451.27 in fact, mechanistically
those interventions can work.
15454.765 Because, indeed, there
are many interventions
15456.64 that we can all do and use
to support our fertility.
15460.33 And again, as a more
general theme today,
15462.52 I really wanted to,
A, teach you about
15464.71 the human reproductive axis--
15466.6 I do find the biology of the
ovulatory and menstrual cycle
15470.23 and spermatogenesis to be
absolutely fascinating to me.
15473.4 And again, if you're somebody
who's interested in conceiving
15475.9 or if you've already
conceived children
15477.73 and even if you don't
want more children,
15479.65 this is really the
aspect of our biology
15482.26 that allowed us to be here.
15484.45 It's the aspect of our biology
that determined whether or not
15487.84 we are male or female.
15489.1 It's the aspect of our biology
that determines so, so much,
15491.74 and yet I think that most
of us generally are not
15494.47 taught this in school or
at least not at the depth
15496.66 that we discussed it today.
15498.37 So hopefully that information
was in and of itself
15501.07 interesting and
perhaps useful as well.
15503.42 And I do think that
even if people are not
15505.21 wishing to conceive more
children that the information
15508.06 related to fertility and
optimizing egg and sperm health
15510.91 is of value in the sense that
optimizing egg and sperm health
15515.2 can be used as a proxy for
optimizing our body and brain
15519.07 health generally.
15519.82 In other words-- and here I'm
admittedly taking words out
15524.05 of the mouths of the
various wonderful doctors,
15526.87 the OB/GYNs and neurologists
that helped inform me
15530.35 in anticipation of this
episode-- what is good
15532.9 for the woman is
good for the egg
15535.03 and for fertility
and for pregnancy.
15537.1 And what's good for the
man is good for the quality
15541.42 and production of sperm and
for fertility and pregnancy.
15545.56 Put differently, whether or
not we are male or female,
15548.92 the things that we can do
to optimize our fertility
15551.65 are the exact same
things that we should all
15554.14 be doing to optimize our
vitality and our longevity.
15557.57 And I realize today's episode
was so much the deep dive
15560.59 and fairly broad, as well,
that it ended up being
15563.56 fairly long and extensive.
15565.33 And yet we still
have not touched
15567.378 on any of the important themes
that I know a number of people
15569.92 want to know about-- so,
for instance, menopause,
15573.43 andropause, PCOS,
and other themes
15576.865 related to hormones and
reproductive function
15578.74 and biology.
15579.47 And I promise that we will have
episodes, both solo episodes
15582.79 and episodes with expert
guests, in the future
15585.55 to cover all of those
topics in detail.
15587.54 Meanwhile, the information
discussed in today's episode
15590.23 should serve as a
basic foundation

15627.16 During today's episode and
on many previous episodes
15629.59 of the Huberman Lab podcast,
we discussed supplements.
15632.11 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
15634.18 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them
15636.28 for things like sleep,
hormone augmentation, focus,
15638.95 and much more.
15640.032 The Huberman Lab
podcast is now partnered
15641.74 with Momentous Supplements
because, as I mentioned
15644.05 at the beginning
of today's episode,
15645.58 Momentous Supplements are
of the very highest quality,
15648.04 they ship
internationally, and they
15649.84 have single-ingredient
formulations
15651.82 that allow you to
develop the most
15653.41 biologically-effective and
cost-effective supplement
15655.89 regimen for you.

supplements discussed
15658.83 on today's and other
Huberman Lab podcasts,

15673.08 And at all of those

15674.82 science and science-related
tools, some of which
15677.1 overlap with the contents
of the Huberman Lab podcast,
15679.35 but much of which is
distinct from the content
15681.603 of the Huberman Lab podcast.

15716.508 this incredible thing that
we call fertility, including

spermatogenesis, fertilization
15722.1 itself, and all the events
leading up to pregnancy.
