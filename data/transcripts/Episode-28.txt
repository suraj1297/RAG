0.36 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.28 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
6.54 [upbeat music]
9.27 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.35 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.32 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.27 Today, we're discussing alcohol,
17.31 one of the most commonly
consumed substances
19.23 on the planet Earth.
20.1 I should mention that both humans
21.84 and non-human animals consume alcohol
24.54 either for recreational purposes
26.73 because they like the
feeling that it gives them
29.79 or for medicinal purposes
31.5 or for other purposes that we'll discuss.
33.87 We are, of course, going to
discuss the effects of alcohol
36.57 on our biology, ranging from its effects
39.03 on individual cells, on
organs and organ systems
42.63 in our brain and body.
43.92 We are also going to discuss the effects
45.75 of the effects of alcohol,
47.49 that is, what being inebriated really does
50.01 to our thinking and our
behavior and how it does it.
52.47 And we are going to address
53.43 what seems to be one of the
more common questions out there,
55.92 which is whether or not low to
moderate amounts of drinking
59.22 are better for our health
60.39 than zero alcohol consumption at all.
63.72 And of course we will talk
64.65 about severe alcohol
intake, binge drinking.
68.61 We will also talk about hangover
70.29 and what science says about ways
72.09 to reduce the effects of hangover,
74.52 either by doing things
that are inoculatory,
76.47 meaning before you drink
or while you drink,
79.11 as well as things to do if
you happen to have a hangover.
82.68 We will discuss some of
the genetic differences
84.6 for alcohol and alcoholism,
86.7 and we will discuss alcohol
consumption in young people
91.32 and how that can be especially
detrimental for reasons
93.99 that I think are going to be
quite surprising to most of you.
96.39 My goal is that by the
end of today's episode,
98.31 you will have a thorough understanding
99.75 of what alcohol does
to your brain and body
101.79 and that you will be able
to make informed decisions
104.13 as to whether or not you
should be consuming zero,
106.95 absolutely no alcohol,
108.87 small to moderate amounts of alcohol,
110.703 and, again, we'll define
exactly what that means,
114.24 small to moderate amounts,
115.98 and if you or somebody else that you know
118.11 is consuming excessive amounts of alcohol
120.42 that are clearly
detrimental to your health,
122.55 some of the better routes and
resources that you can use
125.82 in order to remove that
dependence and/or consumption.
129.24 I'd like to preface all of that by saying
131.82 that today's discussion is really geared
134.37 toward giving you information.
136.38 It is not about judging alcohol intake
138.36 or lack of alcohol intake.
139.98 I just want you to be able to make
141.78 the most informed decision
about alcohol possible.
145.26 I'm pleased to announce that
the Huberman Lab Podcast
147.15 is now partnered with
Momentous Supplements.
149.46 We've partnered with Momentous
150.54 for several important reasons.
151.71 First of all, they ship internationally,
153.39 because we know that many of you
154.74 are located outside of the United States.
156.81 Second of all, and perhaps most important,
158.82 the quality of their
supplements is second to none
161.37 both in terms of purity
162.42 and precision of the
amounts of the ingredients.
164.97 Third, we've really emphasized supplements
167.61 that are single-ingredient supplements
169.8 and that are supplied in dosages
171.87 that allow you to build a
supplementation protocol
174.84 that's optimized for cost,
176.67 that's optimized for effectiveness,
178.56 and that you can add things
180.06 and remove things from your protocol
181.71 in a way that's really
systematic and scientific.
183.81 If you'd like to see the supplements
184.98 that we partner with Momentous on,
186.3 you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
189.42 There, you'll see those supplements,
190.56 and just keep in mind
191.58 that we are constantly expanding
the library of supplements
194.13 available through Momentous
on a regular basis.
196.65 Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
199.23 Before we get into
today's content in detail,
201.93 I just want to answer a
commonly asked question
204.24 about alcohol consumption and the brain,
206.52 and the question that so often comes up
208.95 is whether or not low to
moderate amounts of alcohol,
211.95 so maybe one drink a day
213.45 or one or two drinks a day kind of thing,
215.55 whether or not that is bad for your brain,
218.46 in particular, whether or
not it causes degeneration
220.62 of neurons or nerve cells.
222.03 Now, the reason that
question comes up so often
224.34 is because, for many years,
225.93 it's been known that high
levels of alcohol consumption,
228.36 so 12 to 24 drinks per week or more,
232.41 is certainly causing neurodegeneration,
235.11 in particular of the so-called neocortex,
237.0 the outer layers of the brain
238.8 that house associative memories,
240.9 that house our ability to think and plan,
243.18 that house our ability to
regulate our more primitive drives
247.74 according to context, et cetera.
250.35 So to make very clear, drinking a lot,
253.41 so having, you know, three
or four drinks per night
256.8 every night of the week, is
clearly bad for the brain.
259.71 A recent study, however,
finally addressed the question
262.8 of whether or not low to moderate amounts
265.14 of alcohol consumption can
cause brain degeneration.
268.89 The title of the study
270.57 is Associations between
alcohol consumption
273.0 and gray and white matter
volumes in the UK Biobank,
276.48 the United Kingdom Biobank.
278.46 First of all, gray matter are the neurons,
280.62 it's the so-called cell bodies
281.91 that house the genome
of the cells, et cetera,
283.8 and white matter is the
connections, the fibers,
286.83 the so-called axons of neurons,
288.81 and it's called white
matter because that tissue
292.35 is surrounded by a fatty
tissue called myelin,
294.54 which allows nerve cells
295.77 to communicate with
each other very quickly.
297.63 So what this study did is
it looked at the brains,
300.63 both the gray matter and the white matter,
302.52 of more than 30,000, and
even more than 35,000
306.51 generally healthy
middle-aged and older adults
309.18 in the United Kingdom
310.38 who were drinking various
amounts of alcohol.
313.53 What they found was that even for people
316.2 that were drinking low to
moderate amounts of alcohol,
320.07 so one or two drinks per day,
323.73 there was evidence of
thinning of the neocortex,
327.09 so loss of neurons in the neocortex,
328.71 and other brain regions.
330.87 And I don't say this in
order to cause alarm.
333.03 I tell you this because
they are important data
336.12 because they reveal and
indeed answer the question
339.63 that has been burning for so long
341.01 as to whether or not
chronic alcohol intake
344.37 can disrupt the brain
345.51 even if the chronic intake is very low.
347.7 Now, we should talk about
what the word chronic means
349.53 because many people, when
they hear the word chronic,
352.11 think high levels of
whatever intake, okay?
356.01 So they think 5 drinks a
night or 10 drinks a night
358.95 or people drinking every night.
360.96 Now, in this study, they looked at people
362.13 who, on average, were drinking
one or two drinks per night.
366.06 So that could be 14 drinks on the weekend,
369.39 it could be one drink per night.
371.88 it could be seven drinks on Friday,
374.01 in other words, on average,
one or two drinks per night.
377.1 And I think many people out there
378.6 are drinking somewhere
between one and two drinks
381.54 per night or day of the week on average,
384.96 so that would be 7 to 14 drinks per week.
388.23 So this is an important study
389.55 because it says that if you're consuming
391.56 even just seven glasses
of wine across the week,
394.17 it's likely that there is
going to be some degeneration
397.05 of your brain in response
to that alcohol intake.
400.2 Although, as mentioned earlier,
402.0 we will talk about some of the things
403.26 that can inoculate against
some of that neuronal loss.
406.35 For those of you that are interested
407.46 in reading the study in more detail,
410.1 we've put a link to it in
the show note captions.
412.41 Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast
414.96 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
417.51 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
419.61 to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information
421.41 about science and science-related tools
423.39 to the general public.
424.74 In keeping with that theme,
425.79 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
428.52 Our first sponsor is Levels.
430.53 Levels is a program that lets you see
432.06 how different foods affect your health
433.95 by giving you real-time
feedback on your diet
436.02 using a continuous glucose monitor.
438.48 One of the most important features
440.31 of our immediate feelings of well-being
442.56 and our ability to focus and
think and move and have energy,
445.32 as well as our long-term health,
447.75 are our blood glucose levels.
449.91 That is, our blood sugar levels.
451.44 And that's because all the
cells and tissues of our body
454.11 and especially neurons, nerve cells,
456.03 rely on glucose for fuel.
458.4 I realize some of you
out there are ketogenic,
460.29 and, yes, you can use ketones for fuel,
461.79 but the vast majority of people
463.2 are using glucose for fuel in their cells.
466.59 If you want to maintain energy
and focus throughout the day,
468.84 you want to keep that blood glucose steady
471.45 and you don't want it ever
to spike or to drop too much,
475.23 so you need to understand
how different foods
476.79 and indeed how different activities
478.32 impact your blood glucose.
479.58 I started using Levels about a year ago
481.53 as a way to understand how
different foods and exercise
484.53 and supplements and combinations
of food and exercise
486.93 and even sequencing, like when I do what,
488.52 how that affects my blood glucose levels.
490.17 It's been tremendously informative.
491.94 It's completely reshaped when
I exercise, how I exercise,
495.03 when I eat relative to
exercise, et cetera.
496.98 So if you're interested in
learning more about Levels
498.81 and trying a continuous
glucose monitor yourself,
501.18 go to levels.link/huberman.
503.76 Again, that's levels.link/huberman.
507.39 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
510.09 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
511.65 with cooling, heating, and
sleep tracking capacity.
514.53 I've talked many times on the podcast
516.27 about the fact that getting
a great night's sleep
518.79 is the foundation of mental
health, physical health,
522.03 and all forms of performance.
523.77 And one of the key variables
525.06 in getting a great night's sleep
526.44 is making sure that your
sleeping environment
528.15 is the right temperature.
529.38 Indeed, your brain and body have to drop
531.27 by one to three degrees
in order to get into sleep
534.33 and to stay in deep sleep
throughout the night.
537.36 If your room is too hot or
if you're running too warm,
539.4 you will wake up.
540.27 In fact, that is why you
wake up in the morning.
542.49 With Eight Sleep, you can
adjust the temperature
544.56 of your mattress and your
overall sleeping environment
547.02 and customize that to you.
548.91 I started using Eight Sleep some time ago
551.46 and it's just been a total game changer.
553.68 I program mine so that
there's a subtle drop
555.87 in the temperature of my mattress
556.86 at the beginning of the night
557.73 and then it gets progressively cooler
559.02 and then it heats up toward morning.
560.61 It even has this nice
little vibrate feature
562.71 so it wakes me up by vibrating
the mattress a little bit.
566.13 And, of course, that mattress is warming
567.75 and warming is the way that we wake up.

585.27 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
587.373 ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
589.74 that are of the absolute highest quality,
591.57 and they also have some
unique characteristics.
594.03 The company was founded
594.863 by two all-American swimmers from Stanford
596.91 and everything about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses
599.25 were designed with performance in mind.
601.77 ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses
603.21 can be worn while running or cycling.
605.46 If you get sweaty, they
won't fall off your face,
607.74 and they're extremely lightweight.
609.03 In fact, most of the time,
609.863 I can't even remember
that I'm wearing them.
611.52 I wear ROKA eyeglasses
when I read at night,
613.83 so I wear their readers,
615.03 and I wear sunglasses at various
times throughout the day.
617.73 The great thing about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses
619.77 is that even though they were designed
621.12 for athletic performance,
622.38 they have a terrific aesthetic.
624.06 So unlike a lot of so-called
performance glasses
626.64 that make people look like
cyborgs, in my opinion,
629.46 ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses are the sort
631.2 that you could wear out to dinner
632.28 or that you could wear to work.
633.45 They have a terrific aesthetic.
634.89 If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses or sunglasses,

647.19 Let's talk about alcohol,
648.36 and let's just acknowledge
that human beings
649.8 have been consuming alcohol
for thousands of years.
652.08 If you look at the archeological
evidence from Mesopotamia,
654.57 you'll find that 5,000 years
ago, people had wine vessels.
657.21 Or if you want to know
658.38 when people first started
distilling alcohol,
660.93 much to people's surprise,
661.86 that did not first take place in Ireland,
663.93 and that's not a joke about the Irish.
665.49 You'll see a lot of claims online
666.78 that the Irish were the
first to distill alcohol,
668.64 but, in fact, they were not.
670.26 It was the Chinese that were
the first to distill alcohol,
672.57 and that took place in
China in the first century.
675.36 Alcohol has been used
for nutritional purposes,
677.73 so there are cultures that believe,
680.127 and indeed still believe,
681.54 that the calories in alcohol are useful,
683.61 although later we'll talk
about how alcohol calories
685.62 are indeed empty calories
686.88 and what an empty calorie really
is, why it's called empty.
691.35 Alcohol has been used
for medicinal purposes
693.51 because indeed it does kill bacteria,
695.55 and, as you'll soon find out,
696.66 the fact that it kills bacteria,
698.43 because that is absolutely true,
700.74 it also kills the good
bacteria in your gut,
702.57 and the destruction of that
good bacteria in your gut
704.76 can lead to things like leaky gut syndrome
707.1 and has all sorts of issues,
708.27 and there are ways to
deal with those issues
709.62 and we'll talk about those.
710.85 So alcohol has been used
for medicinal purposes,
712.89 it's been used to clean surfaces,
714.27 it's used in my laboratory
715.47 in order to make up so-called reagents
717.9 to do our experiments,
719.73 but most humans have
been consuming alcohol
722.61 in order to change their internal state,
724.41 in order to feel differently
than they would otherwise.
727.56 That feeling of being drunk or inebriated
729.75 or tipsy or lightheaded is something
732.18 that many, not all, but many
humans seem to enjoy and pursue
736.53 even though, typically,
it leads to a feeling
740.55 of being less happy, less motivated,
744.99 more stressed, et cetera,
when the alcohol wears off.
748.17 That's pretty incredible, right?
749.22 I mean, we're talking about a substance
750.78 that people have been
highly motivated to pursue,
752.82 that are still highly motivated to pursue,
755.01 to create and to consume,
that they'll spend money on,
758.52 and that's despite the fact
that it makes them feel good
761.97 and then it makes them feel lousy.
763.5 Now, some of you might be saying,
764.437 "Well, I drink, but I
don't drink to excess
766.65 and, therefore, I don't feel lousy.
768.12 I feel good when I drink
and then it wears off
770.16 and it allows me to
get through my evening,
771.78 and then the next
morning I'm ready to go."
773.91 Okay, that very well may be
true, I believe those people,
778.5 and, as I mentioned in the
beginning of the episode,
780.18 I'm not here to demonize
alcohol in any way.
782.76 But I do want to point out what alcohol is
785.73 and how it creates the
effects that it does,
788.61 and then I want to talk
about what those effects are
791.43 when you engage in consuming alcohol
794.82 even as often as one
or two nights per week,
797.58 or let's say you're just
somebody who has a drink or two
799.74 on Friday, maybe a few more on Saturday,
801.78 or maybe you're somebody who
consumes all your alcohol
804.27 one night per week or one night per month.
805.95 We'll talk about how that's
affecting your biology.
808.44 So let's address what alcohol is
811.17 and how it affects the cells and tissues
812.73 and organs of your body.
813.78 Then we'll take a look at
some of the epidemiology,
816.24 that is, how many people
are consuming alcohol
818.31 and how much they're drinking.
819.63 And then you will be able,
I think, to get a good sense
822.75 of how the alcohol that you're drinking,
824.58 if you're drinking any at all,
826.92 is impacting your brain and body
828.51 and the choices you might want to make
830.25 about how and when to drink alcohol,
832.8 or even if you want to
eliminate alcohol altogether.
835.2 Okay, so some basic chemistry
and biology of alcohol,
838.17 and, again, I'll make this very clear
839.76 even if you don't have a
chemistry and biology background.
842.52 Because of the structure of alcohol,
844.86 it is what's called both
water-soluble and fat-soluble.
848.88 Translated into what's meaningful for you,
851.61 what that means is when you drink alcohol,
853.89 it can pass into all the cells
and tissues of your body.
857.61 It has no trouble just passing
right into those cells.
860.94 So unlike a lot of substances and drugs
863.91 that actually attach to
the surface of cells,
866.13 to receptors, as they're
called, little parking spots,
868.41 and then trigger a bunch of downstreams,
871.53 like, domino cascades of effects,
873.9 alcohol actually has its
own direct effects on cells
876.75 because it can really just
pass into those cells.
879.51 So it's water- and fat-soluble,
882.0 and the fact that it can pass
883.59 into so many organs and cells so easily
886.32 is really what explains
its damaging effects.
889.47 I should mention that there are
three main types of alcohol.
892.05 There's isopropyl,
methyl, and ethyl alcohol,
895.47 and only the last one,
ethyl alcohol or ethanol,
898.59 is fit for human consumption.
900.48 However, it is still toxic, okay?
903.51 It produces substantial
stress and damage to cells.
907.92 I'd love to be able to tell you otherwise,
909.39 but that's just a fact.
910.92 Ethanol produces
substantial damage to cells,
914.4 and it does that because
when you ingest ethanol,
917.76 it has to be converted into something else
919.56 because it is toxic to the body.
921.66 And there's a molecule inside
of all of us called NAD,
925.11 and you may have heard of NAD
because it's quite popular,
927.75 there's a lot of discussion about NAD
930.18 in the longevity literature right now.
932.037 NAD is present in all our
cells from birth until death.
934.71 The levels of NAD tend to
go down across the lifespan.
937.44 There are ideas that
increasing levels of NAD
939.75 may extend lifespan.
940.8 A lot of that is still controversial,
942.33 or, at least we should say, is ongoing
943.92 in terms of the research.
945.3 But nonetheless, when you ingest ethanol,
947.652 NAD and related biochemical pathways
950.22 are involved in converting that ethanol
952.47 into something called acetaldehyde,
954.09 it's broken down into acetaldehyde.
956.55 And if you thought ethanol was bad,
958.14 acetaldehyde is particularly bad.
959.97 Acetaldehyde is poison.
It will kill cells.
963.09 It damages and kills cells
and it is indiscriminate
965.88 as to which cells it damages and kills.
969.0 Now, that's a problem, obviously,
971.88 and the body deals with that problem
974.07 by using another component of
the NAD biochemical pathway
978.42 to convert acetaldehyde into
something called acetate.
982.74 Acetate is actually something
984.0 that your body can use as fuel.
986.25 And that process of going from ethanol
989.46 to acetaldehyde to acetate
992.43 does involve the production
of a toxic molecule, right?
995.46 Again, acetaldehyde is really toxic.
997.44 And NAD, and if we want to get technical,
1000.11 it's the NAD-to-NADH ratio,
1003.68 and that chemical step
is the rate-limiting step
1007.49 to ethanol's metabolism.
1008.72 What does that mean for you?
1010.22 What that means is that if your body
1012.5 can't do this conversion of ethanol
1014.42 to acetaldehyde to acetate fast enough,
1017.21 well, acetaldehyde will
build up in your body
1019.58 and cause more damage,
1021.2 so it's important that your body
1023.09 be able to do this
conversion very quickly.
1025.88 And the place where it does
that is within the liver,
1029.21 and cells within the liver
1030.62 are very good at this conversion process,
1033.68 but they are cells and they
are exposed to the acetaldehyde
1037.01 in the conversion process,
1038.66 and so cells within the
liver really take a beating
1042.26 in the alcohol metabolism events.
1045.47 So the key thing to understand here
1047.78 is that when you ingest alcohol,
1049.52 you are, yes, ingesting a poison,
1051.44 and that poison is converted
1052.76 into an even worse poison in your body,
1054.47 and some percentage of that worse poison
1056.48 is converted into a form of calories
1058.55 that you can use to generate
energy, generate ATP.
1062.24 And the reason why alcohol
is considered empty calories
1065.51 is because that entire process
is very metabolically costly,
1068.78 but there's no real nutritive value
1071.15 of the calories that it creates.
1073.4 You can use it for immediate energy,
1075.32 but it can't be stored
1076.64 in any kind of meaningful
or beneficial way.
1078.83 It doesn't provide any vitamins,
1080.48 it doesn't provide any amino acids,
1082.16 it doesn't provide any fatty acids,
1084.05 it's truly empty calories.
1085.91 I know some people talk about
sugar is empty calories,
1087.98 but sugar actually is a
far better fuel source
1090.68 than alcohol or acetate.
1093.2 But nonetheless, when you ingest alcohol,
1096.14 some percentage is being
shuttled into a worse poison
1099.26 and some is being shuttled
into a fuel source.
1102.71 Now, the important thing to understand
1104.45 is that it is the poison,
the acetaldehyde itself,
1108.29 that leads to the effect of
being inebriated or drunk.
1112.79 I think most people don't realize that,
1114.11 that being drunk is actually
a poison-induced disruption
1118.43 in the way that your neural circuits work.
1120.41 And so we should ask ourselves,
1121.82 like, which neural
circuits, what brain areas,
1124.28 what body areas are involved
in feeling drunk or inebriated?
1127.79 Now, in thinking about this
state of being tipsy or happy
1130.58 or really drunk or a little bit drunk,
1133.607 I want to mention something
1134.44 that I think most people aren't aware of,
1136.97 and that's the fact that for people
1139.1 that are regular drinkers
1140.72 or that have a genetic
predisposition to alcoholism,
1144.95 when they drink, they tend
to feel very energized
1148.28 and very good for longer periods of time.
1151.58 Again, people who have a genetic
predisposition to alcohol
1153.97 or people who are chronic drinkers
1155.54 or even just, if you recall,
1157.25 chronic doesn't have to
mean a ton of alcohol
1159.5 but they're drinking one or two per night
1161.12 or they're every other night type drinkers
1162.92 or Thursday through Sunday drinkers,
1165.71 those people typically
experience an increase
1168.86 in alertness and mood when they drink,
1171.02 whereas occasional drinkers
1172.82 will have a briefer, meaning
less long-lasting, period
1177.38 of feeling good when they drink
1178.82 and then more quickly
transition into a state
1181.67 in which they're tired or they
start losing motor skills,
1184.46 they start slurring their speech.
1187.04 I also want to emphasize this
is distinct from tolerance.
1189.65 We'll talk about tolerance later
1190.85 and exactly what tolerance means.
1192.56 But I really want to highlight the fact
1193.94 that when people ingest this poison,
1196.97 'cause indeed it is poison,
1199.13 the range of effects is very different,
1201.08 and you can reliably predict
1203.42 who are the people with a
predisposition to alcoholism
1206.42 and who are the people who
are more regular drinkers
1209.27 by the contour or the timing
of the different effects.
1212.51 And, again, people who tend
to feel more alert and excited
1216.83 every time they drink, they
tend to get a real lift,
1219.62 they become kind of the life of the party
1221.03 and that lasts a long while,
1223.37 those people are the ones
that really have to be careful
1226.1 about predisposition for alcoholism.
1229.13 And those people also need to be careful
1231.65 about their drinking
1233.027 and the amount of drinking
that they're doing,
1234.8 even if they're not full-blown alcoholics.
1237.47 Now, of course, people
who are ingesting alcohol
1239.81 who are not accustomed to drink alcohol
1241.16 have to be concerned
about drinking alcohol
1242.9 for other reasons,
1243.733 because it can impair motor function
1245.0 and judgment, et cetera.
1246.71 But in thinking about the
biochemical effects of alcohol
1249.527 and what it's doing to the body,
1251.63 what it's doing in all cases
1254.0 is it's consumed into the gut, right?
1257.03 Goes into the stomach,
1257.863 the liver immediately
starts this conversion
1259.76 that we talked about before
1260.66 of ethanol to acetaldehyde to acetate,
1262.91 and some amount of
acetaldehyde and acetate
1265.1 are making it into the brain,
1266.24 it crosses the blood-brain barrier.
1267.71 Again, the brain has this fence around it
1269.63 that we call the blood-brain
barrier or the BBB.
1272.15 Many things, most things, thankfully,
1274.67 can't pass across the blood-brain barrier,
1276.83 but alcohol, because it's
water- and fat-soluble,
1279.08 just cruises right across this fence
1281.06 and into the milieu, the
environment of the brain,
1284.27 which is made up of a couple
different major cell types,
1286.4 neurons, nerve cells, and
so-called glial cells,
1288.68 which are in between the nerve cells,
1290.66 and we'll talk about the
effects on each of those soon.
1293.66 So what happens when
alcohol gets into the brain
1295.58 that makes us feel tipsy or drunk
1297.14 and, in some people, makes people
1298.49 feel really especially
energized and happy?
1302.06 Well, alcohol is indiscriminate
1304.94 in terms of which brain areas it goes to.
1307.58 Again, it doesn't bind
to particular receptors,
1310.01 but it does seem to have a propensity
1312.47 or an affinity for particular brain areas
1315.11 that are involved in certain
kinds of thinking and behavior.
1317.33 So one of the first things that happens
1319.46 is that there's a slight,
1321.2 at least after the first
drink or second drink,
1324.14 there's a slight suppression
in the activity of neurons
1327.65 in the prefrontal cortex.
1329.03 This is an area of your neocortex
1331.28 that's involved in thinking and planning
1333.35 and, perhaps above all,
1335.36 in suppression of impulsive behavior.
1338.57 So if you go to a party
and they're serving alcohol
1341.45 and people are consuming drinks,
1343.01 what you'll notice is that a
few minutes into that party,
1346.01 the volume of people's
voices will increase,
1348.26 and that's because people are
simply not paying attention
1350.48 to their voice modulation,
1351.71 and as other people start
speaking more loudly,
1353.45 other people are speaking more loudly.
1354.68 We've all had this experience,
right, of going to a party
1356.63 and then you step outside for a moment
1358.28 and you go, "Oh, my
goodness, I was shouting."
1359.72 You come home, the next day,
you've got a sore throat.
1361.43 It might be that you
picked up some sort of bug,
1363.23 some virus or something,
1364.64 but oftentimes it's just the fact
1366.617 that you've been shouting
all night just to be heard
1368.24 because as the prefrontal
cortex shuts down,
1370.52 people stop modulating their
level of speech quite as much.
1375.206 You also notice that people
start gesticulating more,
1377.45 people will start standing
up and sitting down more,
1379.82 they'll start walking around more,
1380.9 if there's music on,
1381.733 people might spontaneously start dancing.
1384.05 All of this is because these
areas of the prefrontal cortex
1387.2 normally are providing what's
called top-down inhibition.
1390.05 They are releasing a
neurotransmitter called GABA
1393.2 onto various parts of the
brain that are involved
1395.3 in impulsive motor behavior
and thought patterns,
1397.97 and as you shut down
the prefrontal cortex,
1400.07 that GABAergic suppression of impulses
1403.67 starts to be released,
1404.51 so people will say things
that they want to say
1407.45 without so much forethought
about what they're saying,
1410.39 or they might do things
that they want to do
1412.82 without really thinking
it through quite as much
1414.92 or they might not even remember
thinking it through at all,
1417.35 or experience, I should say,
thinking it through at all.
1419.3 We haven't talked about blacking out yet
1420.71 and the effects of alcohol on memory,
1422.63 but as long as we're there,
1423.56 I'll just tell you that alcohol
has a very strong effect
1426.65 in suppressing the neural networks
1428.33 that are involved in memory
formation and storage.
1431.21 This is why oftentimes we
forget the events of a night out
1435.02 if we've been drinking.
1436.82 One of the more important things to know
1438.56 about the effects of alcohol in the brain
1441.02 is this disruption in top-down inhibition,
1443.9 but, also, that areas of the brain
1446.84 that are involved in flexible behavior,
1449.69 sort of considering different options,
1451.22 like I could do A or I could do B,
1452.69 I could say this to them
or I could say that,
1454.652 I could say it in that way or
I could say it in this way,
1456.65 this might be a little more tactful,
1458.6 those brain areas basically
shut down entirely
1461.72 and people just tend to
say what they want to say.
1463.88 So the key thing to understand
is that when people drink,
1466.61 the prefrontal cortex and
top-down inhibition is diminished,
1471.2 that is, habitual behavior
and impulsive behavior
1474.5 starts to increase.
1476.15 Now, what's interesting is
this is true in the short term,
1479.21 so after people have one or
two, maybe three or four drinks,
1482.3 but it's also true that the
more often that people drink,
1488.03 there are changes in the very circuits
1490.58 that underlie habitual
and impulsive behavior.
1493.67 This is really important to highlight,
1495.2 so much so that I want to drill
into it a bit more deeply.
1498.8 For the person that drinks,
say, every Thursday night
1501.77 or every Friday night
1502.82 or goes out only on
Saturdays but every Saturday,
1506.3 there's evidence that there are changes
1508.16 in the neural circuits of the brain
1509.78 that control habitual behavior
and impulsive behavior,
1512.6 and they are modified
and strengthened in ways
1516.2 that make those people more
habitual and more impulsive
1519.86 outside the times in
which they are drinking,
1522.74 and when they drink, impulsive
and habitual behavior
1526.07 tends to increase even further.
1527.84 This is something that's
not often talked about
1530.18 when discussing the effects of alcohol.
1531.89 I mean, we all know the
effects of being drunk
1534.65 can be bad, right?
1536.15 Can be bad in terms of
judgment, motor coordination,
1539.39 certainly driving drunk
is a terrible thing,
1541.73 get you or other people killed and so on.
1544.64 But rarely do we hear about
the changes in neural circuits
1547.67 from just one or two
nights of regular drinking.
1552.47 Again, chronic drinking
doesn't necessarily mean
1555.17 every day and every night.
1556.64 It could be the person that simply drinks
1558.32 every Thursday or every Friday
1559.61 or just once a week has
three or four drinks
1561.1 or maybe even a few more.
1563.03 That person is going to
experience a decrease
1565.76 in this top-down inhibition,
1567.62 so an increase in impulsivity
and habitual behavior,
1569.93 because the brake on those behaviors
1571.88 has been removed while they're drinking,
1573.74 but also changes in the
very neural circuits
1576.38 that allow habitual and impulsive behavior
1579.02 to occur more readily even
when they're not drinking.
1581.51 And if you want to know the
actual substrate for that,
1583.73 the cellular substrate, I
can briefly describe it.
1585.68 It's really interesting.
1587.09 Again, you don't need to know any biology
1588.38 to understand this.
1589.28 What it does is it increases
the number of synapses,
1593.03 the actual points of connection
in the neural circuits
1595.34 that control habitual behavior.
1597.83 So there's literally a growth
1599.81 of the neural circuits in your brain
1601.16 that lead to existing
habit execution, all right,
1604.85 the performance of things
you already know how to do,
1607.22 and a reduction in the neural circuits,
1609.8 or I should say a reduction
1610.88 in the number of
synapses, of the contacts,
1613.55 within the neural circuits
that are controlling behavior.
1616.58 So this, again, is a not
often discussed aspect
1619.04 of alcohol intake.
1620.18 Fortunately, it is reversible.
1622.25 So in animals or humans
1624.02 that undertake a period of abstinence
1626.51 of anywhere from two to six months,
1628.94 these neural circuits return to normal
1631.31 except in cases where people
have been chronically drinking
1634.19 large volumes of alcohol
for many, many years.
1636.32 And in those cases,
1637.58 while there is some
recovery of brain circuitry
1640.88 after people get sober,
meaning completely sober,
1644.15 they stop drinking entirely,
1646.04 there is evidence of long-lasting impact
1648.62 of heavy alcohol usage
throughout the lifespan.
1651.29 But, of course, this
doesn't mean that anyone
1652.88 that's suffering from
alcoholism or that used to
1654.8 should not continue to
focus on their health.
1656.93 You absolutely should. All is not lost.
1659.3 But for people that have been
drinking for a lot of years,
1661.04 maybe you went to college and
you drank a lot in those years
1663.56 and your neural circuits changed,
1665.42 if there's a period in which
you don't drink alcohol,
1667.85 again, from two to six
months and ideally longer,
1671.63 those neural circuits
can then be remodified
1673.7 back to their original state.
1675.29 So let's consider some of the
other neurochemical effects
1677.78 of alcohol in the brain and body.
1679.37 And, again, for right now,
1680.78 we're confining the conversation to people
1682.97 that are drinking, on average,
one or two drinks per night.
1686.33 Now, some people might think
1687.163 that two drinks per night is a lot,
1688.58 and a lot of that will
depend on body weight.
1690.41 So for instance, people
who weigh 110 pounds,
1695.45 for them to ingest two alcoholic drinks
1698.39 is going to be substantially different
1699.86 in terms of the biochemical effects
1701.63 than somebody who weighs 220 pounds.
1704.36 Of course tolerance will
also factor into this,
1706.88 genetic background will
also factor into this,
1709.49 and indeed whether or
not people have eaten
1712.13 will factor into this,
1712.97 so there are a lot of factors
and we'll talk about that.
1715.04 For the time being, if you're curious
1716.21 about how food impacts
the effects of alcohol
1719.75 and your feelings of being drunk,
1721.4 you may have heard, for instance,
1722.6 that if somebody's inebriated
and they want to sober up,
1725.06 they should eat something.
1726.08 Turns out that does not work.
1728.12 Here's how it does work, however.
1730.13 If you eat something
prior to drinking alcohol
1733.34 or while ingesting alcohol,
1735.83 it will slow the absorption of
alcohol into the bloodstream.
1739.76 In other words, you won't
feel as drunk as fast,
1742.07 for many of you, this
probably comes as no surprise,
1744.26 in particular, if that meal
includes carbohydrates,
1747.57 fats, and proteins, okay?.
1749.72 The inclusion of all
three major macronutrients
1752.84 seems to slow the absorption
of alcohol into the bloodstream
1755.69 far more than having any one of those
1758.54 or two of those macronutrients present.
1761.24 Now, if you are already inebriated
1763.73 or you've had a glass of wine or a beer
1765.89 and you eat something,
1768.95 chances are that alcohol
has already made it
1771.02 into your bloodstream
1771.853 because it moves into the
bloodstream so quickly.
1774.98 Again, it's fat-soluble and water-soluble,
1777.08 so within minutes, right?
1779.187 If you have an empty stomach,
within five to 10 minutes,
1781.61 that alcohol is going to
be within your bloodstream
1783.35 and distributed throughout your body,
1784.4 maybe even faster depending
on the type of alcohol
1786.68 and your metabolism.
1788.63 But if you're already drunk
and you eat something,
1792.26 it's not going to sober
you up more quickly,
1793.82 but it certainly will blunt the effects
1795.11 of any additional alcohol
that you might consume.
1797.93 And if you're somebody who is concerned
1800.48 about getting too drunk too quick,
1802.19 even from a small amount of alcohol,
1803.42 having some food in your gut
can certainly be beneficial.
1806.93 Now, that's food and alcohol
and the absorption of alcohol,
1810.29 but let's go back to talking
about the biochemical
1813.38 and neurochemical effects
of alcohol on the brain.
1815.93 We talked about top-down inhibition,
1818.03 and we talked about habitual
1819.44 and impulsive behavior circuitry.
1821.87 There are also dramatic changes
in the activity of neurons
1825.92 that control the release
of so-called serotonin.
1828.08 Serotonin is a neuromodulator.
1830.12 It changes the activity of neural circuits
1832.88 and many neural circuits,
1834.05 in particular, those involved in mood
1836.03 and feelings of well-being.
1837.5 Recently, there's been a
lot of interest in serotonin
1840.02 because of a study that was released
1841.34 that showed pretty conclusively
1842.87 that serotonin levels can't
really explain depression
1846.59 and depression-like symptoms.
1848.33 I want to make it very clear
1849.47 that although that study did
show that serotonin levels
1853.16 are not necessarily
associated with depression,
1856.37 the study was interpreted
by many to mean that SSRIs,
1859.61 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
1861.59 which have the net effect
of increasing serotonins,
1864.59 these are things like Prozac, et cetera,
1867.23 that those drugs are somehow not helpful
1870.47 because they increase serotonin
1873.11 and serotonin isn't
involved in depression.
1875.99 That logic doesn't really hold together
1878.36 so I'm going to use this as an opportunity
1879.77 to just clarify what
really occurred there,
1882.41 and then we'll talk about how serotonin
1884.06 relates to alcohol consumption
1885.32 in things like feeling
good and in depression.
1889.16 The key thing is this, SSRIs
can help alleviate depression.
1894.89 That's right. SSRIs can
help alleviate depression.
1897.86 They are often, not always,
associated with side effects,
1900.11 dosage is very important, et cetera.
1902.36 But they probably support
relief from depression
1907.16 by changing neural circuits,
1908.87 not necessarily by
increasing serotonin itself.
1912.11 That is, increasing
serotonin with these drugs
1914.48 likely changed the neural
circuits involved in mood,
1917.54 allowing people to feel better
1918.86 through so-called neuroplasticity,
1920.45 which is the brain's
ability to change itself
1922.58 in response to experience.
1923.9 So there's a bit of confusion,
1924.92 and, again, I'm using
this episode on alcohol
1927.83 to highlight some of the confusion
1929.03 because I think it's timely,
1930.32 because the study just came out
1931.25 and there's a lot of
chatter about this out there
1933.29 that when people are depressed,
1935.72 it's not necessarily because
serotonin levels are low.
1938.84 However, if serotonin levels are increased
1941.21 with things like Prozac,
Zoloft, and other SSRIs,
1944.15 oftentimes there is, yes,
a relief from depression,
1947.84 but that's probably not
1949.31 because of restoring
serotonin levels, per se.
1951.56 It's probably because serotonin
facilitates the changes
1956.21 in neural circuits that need to occur
1957.59 in order for people to
feel elevated mood, okay?
1960.35 So, again, that's a bit
of a tangent and aside,
1962.09 but I do think it's a vital
one for people to know about.
1964.73 Again, if you're thinking
about taking SSRIs
1966.59 or you're currently taking them
and you've heard this news,
1968.87 definitely talk to your doctor.
1970.34 Again, there is great utility
for some of these SSRIs,
1972.71 and, also, in conditions like OCD,
1974.78 they've been shown to be very beneficial,
1976.43 so we really don't want to throw SSRIs out
1978.62 as a potentially valuable treatment.
1981.56 Getting back to the effects
of alcohol on serotonin,
1985.04 it's very clear, beyond any doubt,
1988.61 that many of the circuits in the brain
1990.38 that are involved in mood
and feelings of well-being
1992.84 and also sort of self-image
and how we see ourselves
1997.16 employ the neuromodulator serotonin,
1999.77 and alcohol, when we ingest it
2002.53 and it's converted into acetaldehyde,
2005.56 it goes and that
acetaldehyde acts as a toxin
2009.67 at the very synapses,
2011.11 the connections between
these serotonergic neurons
2013.12 and lots of other neurons.
2014.47 In other words, when we ingest alcohol,
2016.45 the toxic effects of alcohol
disrupt those mood circuitries,
2020.26 at first making them hyperactive.
2022.9 That's right, making them hyperactive.
2023.763 This is why people
become really talkative,
2026.29 people start to feel really good
2027.4 after a few sips of alcohol,
at least most people do.
2030.16 And then as they ingest more alcohol
2033.1 or as that alcohol wears off,
2034.99 serotonin levels and the
activity of those circuits
2037.63 really starts to drop, and
that's why people feel less good.
2040.99 And typically what they do,
they go and get another drink
2043.39 and they attempt to kind
of restore that feeling
2045.7 of well-being and mood.
2046.9 Now, typically what happens
2048.01 is that as people ingest
the third and fourth,
2050.92 maybe even the fifth drink,
2052.96 there's an absolute zero chance
2054.94 of them recovering that
energized mood, right?
2057.73 Most people, as they drink more and more,
2059.62 will now start to feel
more and more suppressed.
2063.31 The forebrain is now
shutting down quite a lot,
2065.56 a lot of the motor cortical areas
2067.51 that control coordinated movement
2069.61 and deliberate movement
start to shut down,
2071.05 so people start to slur their speech,
2073.03 people start to shuffle their feet,
2074.77 people forget their posture,
people start to lean on things,
2078.04 people start passing out on couches.
2080.2 There's a great depression,
2081.7 not depression of the
psychiatric depression sort,
2085.0 but a depression of alertness and arousal,
2090.52 and eventually people will pass out.
2093.07 Now, I said most people
2094.48 because there's a subset of
people that have gene variants
2097.39 or who are chronic drinkers
2100.27 or who are chronic drinkers
and have gene variants
2103.51 that, as they ingest the third and fourth
2106.72 and fifth drink, what happens?
2108.73 They become more alert,
they start talking more,
2111.13 they feel great, they
have all sorts of ideas
2112.84 about the fun they could have that night.
2114.31 And they're the ones that,
2115.75 if you've ever fallen asleep
at a party for whatever reason,
2118.54 or you're getting tired
and you're yawning,
2119.89 you're looking around the room
2120.723 and, like, these people are
still drinking and partying
2122.56 and they're having what seems
to be this amazing time,
2126.31 often, not always,
2127.78 those are the future
alcoholics in the room,
2131.05 or those are the people
2132.46 that have a genetic
predisposition for alcoholism,
2135.58 or those are the chronic drinkers,
2136.897 the people who have built
up enough of a tolerance
2139.87 or who have the chemical genetic makeup
2142.54 such that increasing amounts of alcohol
2145.0 make them feel better
and better and better.
2146.83 And of course, they, too, have a threshold
2149.14 beyond which their nervous system
2150.73 will start to get diminished
2151.9 and they'll pass out,
fall over, et cetera,
2155.38 but that threshold is way, way higher
2157.75 than it is for most people.
2159.73 Now, this is important to understand,
2161.89 and it's important to understand
2163.51 because I think everyone should know
2165.34 and recognize their own predisposition
2167.59 and kind of risk in terms
of developing alcoholism.
2171.67 It's also important to understand
2172.9 because it relates to the
phenomenon of blackout.
2175.48 Many people think that
blacking out is passing out,
2178.15 but blackout drunk is when people drink
2181.36 and they're talking and doing things,
2182.77 sometimes, sadly or tragically,
2185.53 they'll often drive home or walk home
2187.78 or they'll hop on a bicycle and ride home
2189.28 or they'll go swimming in the ocean,
2190.39 all, of course, very
dangerous activities to do
2193.3 when people are really drunk,
2194.92 or even a little bit drunk in some cases.
2196.72 So these people will do
these sorts of things
2199.0 and they do them because they
have the energy to do them
2201.67 and they feel good while doing them,
2203.71 but they are doing them
2204.7 while the activity of
neurons in the hippocampus,
2207.16 which is involved in memory formation,
2208.9 are completely shut off.
2210.37 And this is why the
next day, you tell them,
2214.007 "Hey, maybe we should talk
about what happened last night."
2216.1 Like, "What happened last night?"
2217.36 You said, "Well, do you
remember going to the party?"
2218.777 "Yeah, I know, it was great.
We did this, we did this."
2220.427 "And then what?"
2221.62 And it's very clear all of a sudden
2224.17 that they have no recollection
2226.0 of all the things they were
doing despite being awake.
2229.0 Now, I wish I could tell you
2229.84 that there's some sort of
blood test or other biomarker
2232.12 or even a fingerprint
test that would allow you
2234.55 to determine whether or
not you have a propensity
2237.4 to be one of these drinkers
2238.99 that has a predisposition for alcoholism.
2242.44 And if you've ever been blackout drunk,
2244.48 and certainly if you've
been blackout drunk
2246.34 more than a few times, you
should be quite concerned.
2249.25 And as we talk more about
the more chronic effects
2252.16 and long-lasting effects
of alcohol consumption
2254.92 a little bit later in the episode,
2256.63 I think it'll become clear
2257.56 as to why you should be concerned.
2259.27 But in any case, there is
something that can tell you
2263.47 whether or not you might
be in that category
2266.26 versus likely not in that category,
2268.03 and I alluded to this a
couple of times already,
2269.77 but I want to be really
clear that when people drink,
2274.66 no matter who you are,
2276.04 initially, there's that shutting down
2277.23 of those prefrontal cortical circuits,
2279.43 there's a gradual shutting down
2280.53 of the circuits that control memory,
2282.49 but then people divide
into these two bins.
2284.89 And these two bins
2285.76 are the people who, after
more than a couple of drinks,
2289.3 start to feel sedated,
2291.1 and the people who, after
more than a few drinks,
2293.23 do not start to feel sedated.
2295.54 Now, of course there's
going to be differences
2297.97 created by how quickly
people are drinking,
2300.28 whether or not they're combining
different types of alcohol,
2303.16 the types of alcohol, et cetera,
2305.05 but in general, that can predict
2306.85 whether or not you're somebody
2307.69 who has a predisposition
for alcoholism or not.
2311.47 One also very interesting finding
2313.63 is that alcohol changes the relationship
2316.84 between what's called the hypothalamus
2319.3 and the pituitary gland and the adrenals.
2321.91 Now, the hypothalamus is a
small collection of neurons
2324.19 about the size of a large gumball
2325.75 that sits above the roof of your mouth,
2327.1 and it houses neurons that are responsible
2328.96 for some incredible aspects of
our behavior and our mindset,
2333.13 things like rage, things like sex drive,
2336.37 things like temperature regulation,
2338.02 very primitive functions,
2340.06 including appetite, thirst, et cetera.
2342.61 Alcohol, because it can
go anywhere in the brain,
2344.86 remember it's water- and fat-soluble,
2347.08 has effects on the hypothalamus.
2349.33 The hypothalamus normally
provides very specific signals
2353.68 to what's called the pituitary gland.
2355.18 This is a little gland
2356.32 that actually sticks out of the brain,
2358.27 but it receives instructions
from the hypothalamus.
2362.14 And then the pituitary releases hormones
2364.36 into the bloodstream that go
and talk to your adrenals,
2366.902 and your adrenal gland sit
right above your kidneys
2369.64 in your lower back.
2370.96 And the adrenals release, as
the name suggests, adrenaline,
2374.41 also called epinephrine,
2375.34 and also a molecule called cortisol,
2377.77 which is involved in the kind
of longer-term stress response
2380.68 and it has some healthy effects,
too, on the immune system.
2382.6 Okay, so the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,
2386.53 I know that's a mouthful,
2387.67 you don't need to remember the names,
2389.17 but the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
2391.6 maintains your physiological balance
2393.61 of what you perceive as stressful
2395.2 and what you don't perceive as stressful.
2398.17 People who drink regularly,
2400.15 so this, again, could be just
one or two drinks per night
2402.79 or it could be somebody
that drinks just on Fridays
2405.31 or just on Saturdays or
maybe just on the weekend,
2407.74 two to four drinks,
2409.06 well, those people experience changes
2410.77 in their
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
2414.04 that result in more cortisol,
2415.93 more of this so-called stress hormone,
2417.97 being released at baseline,
when they are not drinking.
2421.66 This is really important.
2423.88 People who drink a bit,
2425.26 and when I say a bit, I
don't mean one or two sips
2427.24 or even a glass of wine
every once in a while.
2429.73 I mean, again, people that are maybe
2431.65 having one drink a night with dinner
2434.56 and maybe on the weekend a few more.
2436.84 Again, I offer a bunch of
different patterns to explain
2439.21 how it could also be two
or three drinks on Friday
2442.63 or six drinks only on Saturday.
2444.76 Well, all of those groups
experience increases
2447.22 in cortisol release from
their adrenal glands
2451.15 when they are not drinking,
2452.5 and as a consequence,
they feel more stressed
2456.28 and more anxiety when
they aren't drinking.
2459.58 This is a seldom talked
about effect of alcohol
2463.15 because so often we hear
2464.35 about the immediate
effects of alcohol, right?
2466.36 And we've been talking
about some of those effects,
2468.25 effects like reducing
the amount of stress.
2470.47 I mean, how many times
have we heard somebody say,
2472.697 "Ugh, I need a drink."
2473.53 And then they have a drink and
they're, like, calmed down,
2475.63 now they can shake off the
thoughts about the day's work
2478.69 they can start to think about things
2480.04 in a maybe more grounded or rational way,
2482.29 or at least they believe that,
2483.43 or they can somehow just relax themselves.
2486.28 Well, while that very well may be true,
2489.04 that it can relax them,
2490.33 when they are not drinking,
that level of cortisol
2493.78 that's released at baseline
has increased substantially.
2497.2 Again, this relates to
a defined neural circuit
2500.65 between brain and body,
2501.73 and it has to do with
the ratio of cortisol
2504.25 to some of the other hormones
2505.9 involved in the stress response.
2508.03 We'll provide a reference to the study
2509.59 that describes how all of this works
2511.24 for those of you that really
want to delve into it,
2513.25 but let's go back to this issue
2515.53 of those who are prone to alcoholism
2517.54 versus those who are not.
2519.04 Remember, there are people
who have genetic variants,
2522.88 meaning genes that they
inherited from their parents,
2525.82 that make it more likely that
they will become alcoholics.
2528.94 But there are also people who drink often
2532.06 who start to experience
this increase in alertness
2534.94 the longer they drink across the night.
2537.79 Part of that effect, we
think, is because of changes
2541.24 in this
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
2543.97 So alcohol is kind of a
double hit in this sense.
2547.45 It's causing changes
in our brain circuitry
2549.34 and neurochemistry that,
2551.47 at the time in which we're
inebriated, are detrimental,
2554.98 and it's causing changes in
neural circuitry that persist
2558.04 long past the time in which
we're experiencing the feeling
2560.68 of being tipsy or drunk.
2562.75 Now, again, I don't want
to demonize alcohol.
2565.06 I'm not saying, oh, you know,
2565.893 if you have a glass of wine now and again
2567.7 or you drink a beer now and again
2568.9 or even have, you know, a
mixed drink now and again
2573.34 or a shot that that's
necessarily terrible for you.
2575.92 I certainly do not want
that to be the message.
2579.52 What I'm saying is that if people
2581.71 are ingesting alcohol chronically,
2583.36 even if it's not every night,
2585.19 there are well-recognized
changes in neural circuits,
2590.11 there are well-recognized changes
2591.85 in neurochemistry within the brain,
2593.95 and there are well-recognized changes
2596.17 in the brain-to-body stress system
2599.62 that generally point in three directions,
2604.0 increased stress when
people are not drinking,
2607.93 diminished mood and feelings of well-being
2610.3 when people are not drinking,
2612.34 and, as you'll soon learn,
changes in the neural circuitry
2617.47 that cause people to
want to drink even more
2621.13 in order to get just back to baseline
2623.83 or the place that they were
2625.27 in terms of their stress modulation
2627.04 and in terms of their feelings of mood
2628.27 before they ever started
drinking in the first place.
2631.45 So again, I don't want
to demonize alcohol,
2634.18 but I do want to emphasize
2635.89 that there are long-term plastic changes,
2638.32 meaning changes in neural
circuitry and hormone circuitry,
2641.14 that, across a period of several months
2643.81 and certainly across a period of years
2645.46 of the sorts of drinking
patterns I described,
2647.53 which I think, for most people,
2649.21 are going to sound, like,
pretty typical, right?
2651.22 I mean, nothing that I described so far
2652.84 was about drinking a case a night
2654.85 or about binging on alcohol
2656.44 in the way that we often
hear about it in the news.
2658.6 These are pretty common
patterns of alcohol consumption.
2661.72 I mean, all you have to do is
board a transatlantic flight
2664.84 or actually go to an airport
on a Sunday afternoon
2667.21 in a sunny area of the US
2668.53 and, you know, people are
having three, four, five,
2670.96 six beers, et cetera.
2672.7 Again, personal choice is personal choice.
2674.89 I'm not telling you what to do.
2676.09 But it's very clear that those
sorts of drinking patterns
2678.76 are changing neural circuitry
2680.23 and they're changing hormone circuitry,
2682.15 and I'd love to be able to tell you
2683.14 that they're changing them for the better,
2684.37 but they simply are not.
2686.11 They're actually changing
them for the worse,
2687.61 and worse is defined as making people
2689.08 less resilient to stress,
2690.43 higher levels of baseline
stress, and lower mood overall.
2693.82 Before we continue with
today's discussion,
2696.07 I'd like to just briefly
acknowledge our sponsor,
2698.14 Athletic Greens, now called AG1.
2701.35 Athletic Greens, AKA AG1,
2703.63 is an all-in-one vitamin,
mineral, probiotic drink
2706.09 that also has adaptogens
and digestive enzymes.
2709.15 I've been taking Athletic
Greens since way back in 2012
2711.85 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
2714.31 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens
2715.9 and the reason I still drink
Athletic Greens twice a day
2718.84 is that it supplies total
foundational coverage
2721.75 of my vitamin and mineral needs,
2723.16 and it supplies important
nutrients that I need
2726.07 to support my gut microbiome.
2727.66 The gut microbiome, as many of you know,
2729.37 supports the immune system.
2730.48 It also supports the
so-called gut-brain axis,
2732.52 which is vital for mood,
2734.02 for energy levels, for regulating focus,
2736.15 and many other features
2737.23 of our mental health and physical health
2738.7 that impact our daily
performance and high performance
2741.22 in any endeavors we might be involved in.
2743.32 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
2744.73 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
2747.46 and claim a special offer.
2748.99 They're giving away
five free travel packs,
2750.64 plus a year's supply of
vitamin D3 K2 with every order.
2754.54 And, of course, vitamin D3 K2 are vital
2756.76 for all sorts of things
2757.93 like hormone health and metabolic health
2759.67 and K2 for cardiovascular
health and calcium regulation.
2762.43 Again, you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman
2765.67 to claim that special offer.
2767.14 Now, I've been talking a little bit
2768.19 about genetic predisposition,
2770.62 but there are a couple of important points
2772.21 I'd like to make about that.
2773.53 First of all, what sorts
of genes are involved
2776.29 in setting someone down the
path of alcoholism or not?
2780.55 Well, it should come as no surprise
2782.47 that the genes that chronic
alcohol usage modifies,
2787.42 they tend to fall
primarily in the pathways
2790.99 related to genetic control
over serotonin receptors,
2795.31 GABA receptors, remember
that top-down inhibition
2797.8 and the involvement of GABA,
2799.0 and, no surprise, the HPA,
2801.7 the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
2803.77 All of those, of course
combined with environment,
2806.38 they combine with
patterns of abuse, right,
2808.84 we know that if you're in a social setting
2810.28 where a lot of people are drinking,
2811.48 the likelihood that you're
going to drink is much higher,
2814.42 social pressures, trauma, right?
2817.78 Some people will use
alcohol to self-medicate
2819.94 to try and turn off their thinking
2821.26 or to deal with trauma, et cetera.
2823.48 So they combine with the environment,
2825.22 but the genes that are in
the serotonin synthesis
2828.55 and receptor synthesis
pathway, GABA and HPA axis,
2832.51 combine with environmental pressures
2834.76 to give rise to alcohol use disorders.
2838.24 So there's a fairly coherent picture
2840.28 that we have here, right?
2841.78 This is not a case where, for instance,
2844.15 people that have a lot of the enzyme
2846.127 for metabolizing alcohol,
2847.09 which we'll talk about in a
minute, alcohol dehydrogenase,
2850.06 it's not like they are
necessarily the people
2852.61 that become alcoholics,
2853.45 whereas certainly in certain cultures,
2855.64 certain Asian cultures in particular,
2857.86 there are gene differences
2860.14 that lead them to have low
levels of alcohol dehydrogenase.
2862.69 There are actually people
2863.523 who have so little alcohol dehydrogenase
2865.21 that when they ingest alcohol,
2866.65 they get very red and they just feel sick.
2868.6 So if you're somebody
that has a sip of alcohol
2870.13 and you just feel horrible,
it makes you feel nauseous,
2872.35 chances are you have gene
variants that create a situation
2876.16 where you're not making very
much alcohol dehydrogenase.
2879.04 You just simply can't metabolize alcohol
2881.11 so you just get a rapid buildup
2882.61 of the toxic effects of
alcohol, the acetaldehyde,
2885.67 you're not converting it
into those empty calories.
2888.46 But in cultures where you
have a lot of genetic variants
2892.66 and genes expressed in people
2894.52 where they have a lot of
alcohol dehydrogenase,
2896.62 sure, they can drink more,
2898.39 and they're converting
more of that alcohol
2900.22 from its toxic form to a non-toxic form,
2903.1 and, yes, of course, you
will observe more alcoholism
2906.01 in those communities because
they're drinking more,
2908.56 but I do want to emphasize
that the environmental factors
2911.62 are playing a strong role there, too,
2913.03 because if you can drink more,
you're likely to drink more.
2915.4 If you're somebody that feels sick
2916.54 immediately from drinking,
2917.89 it's likely that you're
not going to engage
2919.24 in alcohol consumption,
2920.74 especially if these things
are genetically related,
2922.99 and, of course, genes and culture
2924.67 and location in the world
tend to run together.
2927.07 So do you have the gene for alcoholism?
2930.94 Well, there isn't one single gene.
2933.1 Chances are if you have
an immediate relative
2935.95 who's a chronic abuser of alcohol
2938.17 or several relatives who are
chronic abusers of alcohol,
2941.56 well, that's going to predispose
you to be an alcoholic.
2945.16 But since you don't know
which genes you express
2947.41 unless you do genetic testing,
2948.82 and those things are available
2949.96 but most people aren't doing that,
2951.85 this assay, if you will,
2954.01 and it's not an assay, as we say,
2955.54 an assay is a test that you run in the lab
2957.97 to determine something,
2959.47 and it's not one that I recommend
2960.76 that you go drink in order to do,
2962.44 but if you've noticed
that you or somebody else
2964.75 is somebody who can drink
a lot throughout the night
2966.7 and have increased energy
2967.66 and can just drink and drink and drink,
2969.94 and especially if there's
blackout episodes,
2972.31 not remembering things the next day
2973.63 despite being alert throughout
the entire night and so on,
2976.6 well, then I would be very concerned
2978.58 that you might actually
have a genetic variant
2980.32 predisposing you to alcoholism.
2982.06 The other thing that predisposes people
2983.77 to abuse of alcohol is age.
2987.4 People who start drinking at younger ages
2991.06 are greatly predisposed to
developing alcohol dependence
2995.8 regardless of your family
history of alcoholism.
2998.53 Okay, so I'm going to repeat that.
2999.67 People who start drinking younger
3001.68 are at great risk for
developing alcoholism
3004.62 even if they don't have
alcoholism in their family.
3006.93 Now, of course, you don't
have to be an epidemiologist
3009.6 to understand that if you grow
up in a family of drinkers
3012.36 and alcohol is everywhere,
3013.89 and especially if there's peer pressure
3015.21 or lack of oversight,
3016.8 then there's going to
be a higher tendency,
3019.26 or a higher probability, I should say,
3021.12 that you will start
drinking at a younger age.
3023.19 However, even people that grow up
3025.86 nowhere near their relatives,
3027.69 if they start drinking at a young age,
3029.58 so for instance, at 13
or younger or 14 or 15,
3033.42 there's a much higher probability
3034.68 that they're going to develop
3036.09 a long-lasting dependence on alcohol.
3038.94 People who take their
first sip of alcohol later,
3042.69 15, 16, or one would hope even later,
3044.85 I can say one would hope
3045.78 'cause I'm now of that, you
know, age and generation
3047.88 where, you know, you
think about all the things
3049.74 that young people do,
and you go, "Oh, gosh,
3052.14 if they only would wait or
if they only would abstain."
3054.6 You know? It's just what happens.
3056.04 I don't know, there's some
neural circuit for that
3057.33 that I can't explain yet.
3058.59 But people who, for instance,
3060.72 drink only once they reach
legal age of drinking,
3063.3 which in the US, I believe in
every state is 21 years old,
3066.78 if they take their first drink at 21,
3068.64 the probability that they'll go on
3070.08 to develop full-blown alcohol dependence
3072.27 or alcohol use disorder, as
it's called, AUD, is very low.
3075.72 Now, a subset of them will
3076.8 because they have such a
strong genetic predisposition
3079.29 or maybe life circumstances
create a pattern
3082.53 in which they become a chronic drinker.
3084.48 But I found this very interesting.
3086.28 Genes matter, but also the age
3089.19 in which somebody starts
drinking really matters.
3092.28 Now, whether or not that's
because there are changes
3094.2 in neural circuitry as a
consequence of that drinking
3097.05 that make people want to seek
out more and more alcohol,
3100.14 or whether or not there's
some other effect,
3102.24 maybe it's a change in
hormones, et cetera,
3104.49 that predisposes those young drinkers
3106.5 to become chronic drinkers or
even full-blown alcoholics,
3109.59 certainly developing alcohol use disorder.
3111.96 There's a definition for
that. We can talk about it.
3113.55 It involves the amount of drinking
3115.56 over a certain period of time, et cetera.
3117.9 So it's very clear that
drinking early in life
3120.51 creates a propensity for the development
3123.27 of alcohol use disorder later in life.
3126.51 And while there is a genetic component
3129.03 to developing alcohol use disorder,
3131.88 I find it very interesting
3133.11 that if people who have
those gene variants
3136.47 delay their onset of drinking,
3138.48 well, then the probability
that they'll develop
3140.13 full-blown alcohol use
disorder drops as well.
3143.13 So again, it's genes and environments.
3144.87 It's not an either/or
3145.74 and there's no single gene for alcoholism.
3148.14 Well, I promise you I will also talk
3149.97 about some of the documented
positive effects of alcohol.
3153.66 Although they are very few and
far between, they do exist.
3157.5 But before I do that, I would be remiss
3159.69 if I didn't emphasize some
more of the terrible things
3162.72 that alcohol does and
the way that it does it.
3165.33 And for those of you that enjoy alcohol,
3168.57 again, I'd like to say I feel
guilty about telling you this
3172.65 because I know how much some
people enjoy a good drink
3175.08 every once in a while,
3175.913 and I say a good drink
3176.746 because some people do
like the taste of alcohol.
3179.25 I suppose I lucked out
3180.083 in that I don't really
like the taste of alcohol
3182.037 and that it just puts me to sleep,
3183.15 but I know that people do enjoy it.
3184.83 And I do want to point out
that there is zero evidence
3190.32 that, you know, provided
somebody is of drinking age,
3194.25 certainly not in the stage
of brain development,
3197.4 that having one drink or two
drinks every now and again,
3200.91 meaning every three or
four weeks or once a month,
3203.97 that is not going to cause
major health concerns
3207.6 or major health issues for most people.
3210.15 I suppose if you have zero
3212.34 or very little alcohol dehydrogenase,
3214.17 it might make you feel sick,
3215.003 but then you're probably
not the kind of person
3216.39 that's going to be drinking at all.
3218.31 So, again, if you enjoy alcoholic drinks,
3221.13 I'm not trying to take them
away from you by any means,
3226.2 but you should know what drinking does
3228.45 if you're consuming it
3229.47 in this kind of typical chronic pattern,
3231.57 as we can now refer to it,
3232.71 which is that one or two a night
3234.96 or a few stacked up on Friday
3238.68 and maybe three or four on Saturday,
3240.42 this kind of pattern of
drinking, which is quite common.
3243.42 And one of the more serious effects
3244.95 that we should think about
3246.18 is the impact on the
so-called gut-brain axis,
3248.58 or for sake of today's discussion,
the gut-liver-brain axis.
3252.24 I don't think the gut-liver-brain axis
3253.8 has ever been discussed on this
podcast, maybe any podcast.
3256.53 Although at the moment I say that,
3258.39 you know, the gut-liver-brain axis,
3260.88 people are going to come after me
3261.93 with, I suppose, gut, liver, and brains.
3264.48 In any event, you have
a brain. You have a gut.
3269.22 That gut runs from your throat
3271.38 down to the end of your intestine.
3276.09 Your gut and your brain communicate
3278.04 by way of nerve cells,
neurons and nerve connections,
3281.37 the vagus nerve in particular,
3283.26 and by way of chemical signaling.
3285.72 Your gut also communicates
by way of chemical signaling
3288.36 and, believe it or not,
3289.193 by way of neural signaling,
too, to your liver.
3292.44 And, as we talked about earlier,
3293.85 the liver is the first
site in which alcohol
3296.79 is broken down or metabolized
into its component parts.
3301.53 The liver is also
communicating with the brain
3304.32 through chemical signaling
and neural signaling,
3306.96 so we have the gut-liver-brain axis.
3310.29 And what you find
3312.18 is that people who ingest
alcohol at any amount
3316.74 are inducing a disruption in
the so-called gut microbiome,
3321.09 the trillions of little microbacteria
3324.0 that take resident in your gut
3325.47 and that live inside you all the time
3326.85 and that help support your immune system
3328.32 and that literally signal
by way of electrical signals
3331.95 and chemical signals to your brain
3333.96 to increase the release of things
3335.76 like serotonin and dopamine
3337.14 and regulate your mood
generally in positive ways.
3339.6 Well, alcohol really
disrupts those bacteria,
3342.03 and this should come as no surprise.
3343.2 I mean, earlier, we talked
about this and it's well known,
3345.27 if you want to, you know,
sterilize something,
3347.31 you want to kill the bacteria,
you pour alcohol on it.
3349.767 And I can remember scraping
myself or cutting myself
3353.88 or I was always injuring
myself when I was a kid,
3355.86 and, you know, the moment
they take out the peroxide,
3358.5 you're like, "Oh, boy, here it comes."
3359.64 But if there's no peroxide around
3361.38 and you've got a wound there
and you need to clean it out,
3363.39 yeah, they'll use alcohol,
3364.98 which I do not recommend, by the way.
3366.51 That's one of the harshest
ways to clean a wound.
3368.64 But for centuries,
thousands of years really,
3371.04 alcohol has been used
in order to clean things
3373.98 and kill bacteria.
3375.69 So alcohol kills bacteria
and it is indiscriminate
3379.74 with respect to which bacteria it kills,
3382.23 so when we ingest alcohol
and it goes into our gut,
3384.48 it kills a lot of the
healthy gut microbiota.
3387.87 At the same time, the metabolism
of alcohol in the liver,
3390.99 which you now understand,
3392.16 that pathway involving NAD,
acetaldehyde, and acetate,
3397.56 that pathway is proinflammatory,
3400.83 so it's increasing the release
of inflammatory cytokines,
3403.89 things like IL-6, et cetera,
tumor necrosis factor alpha.
3407.85 If you'd like to learn more
about the immune system,
3409.41 we did an episode all
about the immune system.
3411.51 You can find it at hubermanlab.com.
3412.98 It'll teach you all the
basics of what are cytokines,
3415.44 what are mast cells, et cetera.
3417.54 In any event, all these
proinflammatory molecules,
3422.1 those are being released.
3423.96 You've now got disruption
of the gut microbiota.
3427.38 As a consequence, the lining
of the gut is disrupted,
3430.56 and you develop, at least
transiently, leaky gut.
3435.03 That is, bacteria that exists in the gut
3437.46 which are bad bacteria
3438.75 can now pass out of the
gut into the bloodstream,
3440.85 so you've got a two-hit
kind of model here.
3443.07 In biology, we talk about two-hit models,
3445.47 that is, it's kind of a
one plus one equals four,
3447.99 and it's generally when you hear two-hit,
3449.34 it's not a good thing.
3450.75 So you've got bad bacteria
from partially broken down food
3455.22 moving out of the gut,
3456.3 the good bacteria in the
gut have been killed.
3458.37 You might say, why doesn't the alcohol
3459.78 kill the bad bacteria in the gut?
3462.03 Well, the bad bacteria that are
from partially digested food
3467.07 oftentimes escape the gut
3469.41 before the alcohol can disrupt them,
3472.47 and so now you've got
leaks in the gut wall,
3475.41 you've got the release
of this bad bacteria,
3477.24 you've got inflammatory cytokines
3479.28 and other things being
released from the liver,
3481.26 and they are able to get into the brain
3483.81 through what's called a
neuroimmune signaling.
3486.48 And what's really bizarre,
3488.07 in terms of the way that
this manifests in the brain,
3490.77 I mean, it's not the
way I would've done it,
3492.87 but then again, as I always say,
3494.19 I wasn't consulted at the design phase,
3496.68 and anyone who says they did,
3497.7 you should be very skeptical of them.
3500.43 The net effect of this
3501.75 is actually to disrupt the neural circuits
3505.05 that control regulation of alcohol intake,
3507.75 and the net effect of that is
increased alcohol consumption.
3512.37 So this is just terrible, right?
3513.78 I mean, so you take in something
that disrupts two systems,
3517.62 the gut microbiota, and
it disrupts in two ways,
3519.87 it's killing the good gut microbiota
3521.91 and it's allowing the bad bacteria
3525.84 to move from the gut into the bloodstream,
3527.52 you've also got proinflammatory cytokines
3529.71 coming from the liver,
3530.97 and those converge or arrive in the brain
3535.11 and create a system in
which the neural circuits
3538.29 cause more drinking.
3540.15 That's a bad situation.
3541.5 And this is why people
who drink regularly,
3544.05 even if it's not a ton of alcohol,
3546.81 again, of the sorts of
patterns of drinking
3548.49 I talked about before,
3549.323 and certainly for those that
are chronic heavy drinkers,
3552.6 what you end up with is a situation
3554.34 in which you have inflammation
3555.96 in multiple places in the brain and body
3558.0 and the desire to drink even more
3560.34 and to further exacerbate
that inflammation
3562.32 and the gut leakiness.
3564.12 So this is basically a terrible scenario
3566.28 for the gut-liver-brain axis,
3568.62 and it's especially prevalent
3569.91 in so-called alcohol use disorder,
3571.44 again, people that are ingesting
3572.43 somewhere between 12
and 24 drinks per week.
3574.95 For those of you that are interested
3576.15 in learning more about
the gut-liver-brain axis
3578.22 and, in particular, alcohol use disorder,
3580.14 I'll provide a link in
the show note captions.
3582.33 There's a wonderful review
on this that details that.
3585.57 But on the positive side,
3587.46 it points to the possibility
that at least some,
3590.07 again, at least some,
3591.63 of the negative effects
of alcohol consumption,
3593.67 whether or not you're somebody
3594.78 who's currently ingesting alcohol
3597.0 or who used to ingest alcohol
3598.047 and is trying to so-called
repair these systems
3600.45 of the brain and body,
3601.56 whether or not replenishing
the gut microbiota
3603.99 is going to be beneficial.
3604.89 And we know that there
are ways to do that,
3607.05 and we know that there's
at least some promise
3609.09 for the ability for this
system to repair itself.
3611.85 How does one do that?
3613.11 Well, I've talked before
about this on the podcast,
3615.24 but studies done by colleagues
of mine at Stanford,
3617.73 Justin Sonnenburg, who's been
on this podcast as a guest,
3620.07 an amazing episode all
about the gut microbiome,
3622.14 and his collaborator, Chris Gardner,
3623.76 also at Stanford School of Medicine,
3625.86 have explored not alcoholism,
3628.83 but what are ways to
improve the gut microbiota,
3632.88 in particular, to reduce the production
3636.66 of inflammatory cytokines
3638.49 and to adjust what's
called the inflammatome.
3640.56 You've heard of the genome
and the proteome, et cetera.
3643.11 Well, the inflammatome is the total array
3646.95 or at least the near-total array
3648.57 of genes and proteins
that control inflammation.
3651.36 How can you reduce inflammation
3652.77 and make that inflammatome healthier?
3655.2 Well, they've shown that
two to four servings
3658.02 of fermented foods per day,
3659.67 and here, I'm not referring
to fermented alcohol.
3661.71 I'm talking about
low-sugar fermented foods,
3663.2 so things like kimchi, sauerkraut, natto,
3667.62 for those of you that like Japanese food.
3669.96 There are others, I
know, things like kefir
3672.3 or things like yogurts that
have a lot of active bacteria,
3675.63 again, low-sugar varieties
of all these things.
3679.05 Those are terrific at
reducing inflammatory markers
3683.1 and at improving the gut microbiome.
3685.8 One could imagine that
either inoculating oneself
3689.01 from some of the effects of alcohol,
3690.66 although I'd prefer that people
3691.59 just not drink alcohol
chronically, frankly,
3694.53 or if somebody's trying to
repair their gut microbiome
3697.2 because they ingested a lot of alcohol
3699.51 or because they had a lot of
these inflammatory cytokines
3701.64 for many years or even
a short period of time,
3704.43 regular ingestion of two to four servings
3706.62 of these fermented foods
can be quite beneficial.
3711.122 I want to make it clear,
that has not been examined
3713.19 specifically in the context
of alcohol use disorder,
3717.15 but because a huge component
3719.79 of the negative effects
of alcohol use disorder
3721.98 are based in this gut-liver-brain axis
3724.02 and disruption of the gut microbiome
3725.067 and the inflammatory cytokines,
3727.11 it stands to reason that things
that are well-established
3730.26 to improve inflammation status,
3732.96 in other words, reduce inflammation,
3734.61 such as ingesting two to four servings
3736.26 of low-sugar fermented foods per day,
3739.59 makes sense in terms of trying to repair
3741.51 or replenish the system.
3743.28 One could also imagine taking
probiotics or prebiotics.
3745.86 Certainly that would work as well,
3747.84 although I've sort of
favored the discussion
3749.85 around fermented foods
3750.81 and replenishment of the gut microbiome
3753.0 mostly because there are more studies
3755.88 that have examined that in humans
3757.56 and because of the direct relationship
3759.54 that's been established between doing that
3761.16 and reducing negative markers
within the inflammatome.
3764.34 And I should mention,
3765.39 along the lines of repair and recovery,
3767.19 I put out a question on
Twitter the other day.
3769.26 I said, "What do you want
to know about alcohol?"
3771.15 I got more than 1,000 questions
3773.31 and I'll take some more of those questions
3774.57 a little later in the episode.
3775.53 But one of the things I noticed
3776.49 is that many of the
questions, hundreds, in fact,
3780.09 related to the question of,
3782.49 well, if I drank a lot
previously, am I doomed?
3785.82 Can I reverse the negative effects?
3787.44 Or, you know, I'm trying to drink less
3789.6 and I'm trying to improve
my health as I do that.
3791.91 What should I do?
3792.743 Well, certainly focusing a
bit on the gut microbiome
3796.14 ought to be useful.
3797.55 The other thing I should mention
3798.69 is as people wean themselves off alcohol,
3801.06 even if they're not full-blown alcoholics
3803.34 or have alcohol use disorder,
3805.02 they should understand that
that increase in cortisol
3808.92 that we talked about earlier
3809.91 that leads to lower stress threshold
3812.04 and greater feelings
of anxiety and stress,
3815.73 that's going to be present
3816.99 and it's going to take
some time to dissipate.
3819.33 So for some people, it might
even just be helpful to realize
3822.63 that as you try and wean
yourself off alcohol
3825.38 or maybe you even go cold turkey,
3827.25 that increased anxiety
and feelings of stress
3831.39 should be expected.
3832.65 And in that case, I would
point you to an episode
3834.42 that we did on master stress.
3835.95 You can find that, again,
at hubermanlab.com.
3837.75 It's got a ton of behavioral, nutritional,
3839.61 supplementation-based, exercise-based,
3841.65 I suppose, exercise is
behavioral, but a lot of tools.
3844.62 You can navigate to those
easily 'cause we have timestamps
3846.75 so you can go right to
the topic of interest.
3848.37 Those tools are going to be very useful
3849.78 in trying to clamp or control your stress.
3852.3 And the point here
3853.17 is just that some increase
in stress should be expected,
3857.01 and it should be expected
3858.15 because of that increase in cortisol
3859.68 that occurs with even
low-level consumption
3862.38 yet chronic alcohol consumption.
3864.42 Now I'd like to talk about
a fairly common phenomenon,
3867.63 which is post-alcohol consumption malaise,
3871.47 also referred to as hangover.
3874.05 Hangover is a constellation of effects
3877.08 ranging from headache to nausea
3880.14 to what's sometimes called hangxiety,
3882.54 which is anxiety that
follows a day of drinking.
3887.01 Hangxiety, I think we can
understand physiologically
3890.25 if we think about that
process of alcohol intake
3894.9 increasing the amount of cortisol
3896.94 and the ratio of cortisol to
some other stress hormones.
3900.57 That well explains why some
people wake up the day after
3904.23 or even the day the day
after a night drinking
3908.76 and feel anxious and not well
3910.8 and stressed for reasons
they don't understand.
3913.26 So if you're somebody who
experiences hangxiety,
3917.28 then, again, I refer you to
the master stress episode
3920.49 that we put out some time ago,
3922.38 and you can find that at hubermanlab.com,
3924.33 tools to deal with anxiety,
tools to deal with stress,
3926.49 ranging, again, from
behavioral to nutritional
3928.62 and supplement-based, et cetera.
3930.87 That, of course, is not justification
3933.21 for going out and drinking so much
3934.68 that you get hangxiety-induced hangover,
3938.04 but for those of you that are experiencing
3939.96 post-alcohol consumption
hangxiety, as it were,
3943.41 that could be a useful resource
3944.85 because I certainly don't want anyone
3946.44 experiencing uncomfortable
amounts of anxiety,
3949.17 and there are great tools
and resources for that.
3951.57 Now, the other aspects of hangover,
3954.15 such as the stomachache or headache
3958.38 or feelings of malaise or fogginess,
3961.17 those could be related to a
number of different things
3962.85 and probably are related to
a number of different things.
3965.19 First of all, the sleep that
one gets after even just one,
3970.02 yes, even just one glass of wine or a beer
3973.98 is not the same sleep that you get
3975.72 when you don't have alcohol
circulating in your system.
3978.3 And not trying to be a downer here,
3979.65 but this was discussed in the
Huberman Lab Podcast episode
3982.71 where I had Dr. Matthew
Walker from UC Berkeley on.
3986.16 And, of course, Dr. Walker
is a world expert in sleep,
3989.85 runs one of the preeminent laboratories
3991.59 studying sleep and its effects,
3993.51 wrote the incredible book,
"Why We Sleep," and so on.
3997.68 Dr. Walker told me, and
it certainly is supported
4000.29 by lots and lots of quality
peer-reviewed studies
4003.32 in animals and in humans,
4005.09 that when alcohol is present
in the brain and bloodstream
4008.45 that the architecture
of sleep is disrupted.
4010.28 Slow-wave sleep, deep sleep,
and rapid eye movement sleep,
4013.16 all of which are essential
4014.09 for getting a restorative
night's sleep, are all disrupted.
4016.31 So for those of you
4017.18 that are drinking a glass or two of wine
4019.73 or having a hard liquor drink or a beer
4023.75 in order to fall asleep,
4025.4 the sleep you're getting is
simply not high-quality sleep,
4027.95 or certainly not as high-quality
4029.33 as the sleep you'd be getting
4030.32 if you did not have
alcohol in your system,
4032.99 Of course, when we're
talking about hangover,
4034.82 we're talking generally
about the consumption
4037.16 of more than just one or two drinks.
4039.59 Of course, for some
people, one or two drinks
4041.33 is probably sufficient to induce hangover,
4043.25 but for most people it's going
to be having three or four,
4045.92 exceeding their typical
limit, as it's called.
4048.59 Again, not the legal limit,
that's a whole other business.
4051.71 But when one ingests too
much alcohol for them,
4056.63 one of the reasons they
feel terrible the next day
4059.33 is because their sleep
isn't really good sleep.
4061.37 In fact, it's not even sleep.
4062.9 It's often considered pseudosleep,
4064.981 or at least that's what it's called
4065.814 in the sleep science field,
4067.1 because people are in kind of a low-level,
4069.02 hypnotic kind of trance,
it's not real sleep,
4071.1 there are multiple bouts of waking up,
4072.98 they may not even realize
they're waking up multiple times.
4075.89 Okay, so there's the
sleep-induced effects.
4077.69 Then there are the disrupted
gut microbiome effects,
4081.89 some of which we talked about earlier
4083.18 so now you understand the mechanism
4085.01 of alcohol destroying good,
healthy gut microbiota,
4089.57 which then leads to leaky
gut and things of that sort.
4092.3 But one could imagine,
again, could imagine,
4095.03 and there is some evidence
starting to support this,
4097.76 that, again, ingesting
low-sugar fermented foods
4101.51 or maybe even prebiotic or probiotics
4103.34 to support the gut microbiome
4104.78 might assist in some of
the gut-related malaise
4108.59 associated with hangover.
4110.21 In other words, get those
gut microbiota healthy again
4113.45 as quickly as possible,
4114.38 or maybe even before you drink,
4116.09 have those gut microbiota healthy.
4117.38 I would hope that you'd do that.
4118.213 I think everybody should
be doing something
4119.57 to support their gut microbiome,
4120.95 whether or not it's the ingestion
4122.0 of low-sugar fermented foods daily
4123.83 or at least on a regular basis
4125.57 or ingestion of probiotic or prebiotic.
4127.97 The gut microbiome is so important
4129.47 for so many different things.
4131.12 In terms of hangover and headache,
4135.02 we know that that's caused
by vasoconstriction,
4138.08 the constriction of blood
vessels that tends to occur
4140.57 as a rebound after a night of drinking.
4142.91 Alcohol can act as a vasodilator,
4144.61 it can dilate the blood vessels.
4146.12 Part of that is associated
with the increase
4149.36 in so-called parasympathetic tone.
4151.34 We have an autonomic nervous system
4152.537 and it's got a sympathetic component.
4154.94 These are neurons that make us more alert,
4157.22 and if they're very active,
they make us very stressed.
4159.56 There's also the parasympathetic aspect
4162.65 of the autonomic nervous system.
4163.7 This is all just fancy geek speak
4165.2 for the parts of your brain and body,
4166.97 the nerve cells that
make you very relaxed.
4168.62 When you're very relaxed,
there tends to be vasodilation.
4172.73 It allows for more movement of blood
4175.07 and other things through the bloodstream,
4177.47 and alcohol tends to
induce some vasodilation,
4180.68 at least in some of the capillary beds.
4182.39 And then when the alcohol wears off,
4184.37 there's vasoconstriction and
people get brutal headaches.
4188.12 That's why some people will
take aspirin or Tylenol
4191.0 or Advil or things like that,
4193.247 the sort of non-steroid
anti-inflammatories.
4195.89 I should mention, there is a
lot of literature coming out
4198.62 that some of these non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs
4202.34 are not good for us for a
number of different reasons,
4204.133 the way they impact the liver,
4206.36 the way they impact the immune system,
4208.34 and, no surprise, the way they
impact the gut microbiome.
4211.88 So I'm not one to tell
you what medications
4214.43 to take or not take,
4215.39 but you certainly would want
to do a quick web search
4217.79 of effects of non-steroid
anti-inflammatories
4222.59 and aspirin before you start taking those,
4224.96 or stop taking those, for that matter.
4227.66 Generally, they will alleviate headache,
4229.16 but they can often have other issues,
4230.93 including liver issues.
4231.83 And keep in mind, the
night after drinking,
4233.87 your liver has already taken a beating
4236.03 because of the need of the liver
4238.07 to convert alcohol from
acetaldehyde into acetate,
4242.84 which is now a pathway
that you well understand.
4245.06 So I'm not certain
4246.74 and, in fact, I believe
it's not the greatest idea
4248.57 to burden your liver further
4250.55 through the use of things
that are going to cause it
4253.85 to have to work harder
and metabolize things
4256.04 if the goal is simply
to alleviate a headache.
4258.71 There's a lot of kind of lore,
4261.14 old school lore about how
to relieve a hangover.
4263.09 We already talked about how
eating food won't do that
4266.09 but eating food will
prevent the rapid absorption
4269.66 of even more alcohol into the bloodstream.
4271.91 There's the lore that one should
simply ingest more alcohol.
4275.69 What terrible advice that is.
4277.34 That's just going to delay
an even worse hangover.
4279.5 However, I'd be remiss if I
didn't say that the reason
4283.07 that that myth came to be,
4285.47 or that, I should say,
that truth came to be,
4288.41 because indeed ingesting more alcohol
4291.17 will alleviate a hangover
4292.67 but then a worse hangover will show up,
4294.74 the reason that came to be
4295.61 is because ingestion of more alcohol
4297.41 will cause those constricted vessels
4299.81 that are giving the
headache to dilate again.
4302.03 But, of course, ingesting more
alcohol to relieve a hangover
4304.49 is simply a bad idea.
4305.99 Just don't do it.
4306.823 I think this is called the
hair of the dog approach.
4308.75 Maybe someone can put in the
show note captions on YouTube
4311.27 why it's called the hair of the dog.
4313.97 I can come up with a few ideas
4315.38 but they're not going
to be very good ones,
4318.47 and some of them would probably
even be outright ridiculous.
4322.01 So do not ingest more alcohol
4323.96 simply to try and recover from a hangover.
4326.63 I know many people have
tried that one before
4328.76 but that's a terrible idea.
4330.56 Now, one thing that
you'll also hear out there
4332.12 is that deliberate cold exposure,
4334.22 for instance, taking a cold
shower, might relieve hangover.
4337.22 I find this one particularly interesting
4338.78 because we've done
episodes on the benefits
4340.94 of deliberate cold exposure.
4341.87 We have an entire episode about that.
4343.333 You can find it, again, hubermanlab.com.
4345.99 There are direct links
to some of the tools
4348.08 related to deliberate cold exposure
4349.73 and we have an entire newsletter
4352.73 on deliberate cold exposure protocols
4354.5 that you can find on hubermanlab.com,
4355.85 go to our Neural Network newsletter.
4357.71 So those of you that are
interested in ice baths
4359.69 and cold showers and
ways to leverage those,
4362.21 you can find that there.
4363.47 What you won't find there is a description
4365.24 of how to use deliberate cold exposure
4366.65 for sake of treating hangover.
4368.12 But here, I went into the literature
4369.44 and I found something kind of interesting.
4371.12 There is some evidence
4372.59 that increasing levels of
epinephrine in the bloodstream
4376.01 can actually help with alcohol clearance.
4378.71 That was very surprising to me,
4379.97 and I want to point out
4380.803 this is not a large and robust literature,
4383.03 but there's some evidence
pointing to the fact
4384.92 that when levels of
epinephrine, adrenaline,
4386.93 are raised in the brain and bloodstream,
4388.94 that some of the components
of alcohol metabolism
4391.16 can be accelerated
4392.36 and some of the inebriating
effects of alcohol
4395.0 can be reduced,
4395.833 so maybe this old school
lore of taking a cold shower
4398.36 actually has something to it.
4399.68 So in thinking about the use
of deliberate cold exposure
4402.05 in order to reduce the effects of hangover
4404.6 or to more rapidly clear alcohol
4408.08 from the brain and bloodstream,
4409.79 I want to be very clear and I
want to emphasize your safety.
4414.56 The way to do that is to understand
4416.42 that alcohol lowers core
body temperature, okay?
4419.65 It can make people slightly hypothermic.
4422.6 It's going to drop core body temperature.
4425.0 So if you were inebriated
4427.49 and you went and got into
a body of water, right,
4430.04 a pool or a lake or something,
4432.05 first of all, that's extremely dangerous
4433.88 to do while you're inebriated, right?
4435.59 People drown all the time.
4436.79 People drown, they die as a
consequence of doing that,
4439.19 so please don't do that.
4440.99 But also, if it's very cold water,
4443.09 your core body temperature is
going to drop even further.
4445.79 Now, if you've heard the
episodes that I've done
4447.53 on deliberate cold exposure previously,
4450.53 I've talked about how normally,
4452.09 when people are not ingesting alcohol,
4454.34 they get into an ice bath or a cold shower
4456.08 and their body temperature initially dips
4457.85 but then it rebounds and increases.
4459.47 That's a process that's going to occur
4460.97 when people do not have
alcohol in their system.
4463.61 When you have alcohol in your system,
4465.02 one of the reasons that
you become hypothermic
4467.69 is because there's a disruption
4469.22 in those hypothalamic brain areas,
4470.69 in particular, the brain area
4471.68 called the medial preoptic area
4473.48 that regulates core body temperature.
4475.43 So it's not so much that
alcohol makes you cold,
4478.01 it's that alcohol disrupts
the central command centers
4481.49 of the brain that control
temperature regulation,
4483.77 and that leads you to
be slightly hypothermic.
4486.77 So if you then go get
into a very cold lake
4489.2 or you get into even a
cold shower or an ice bath,
4492.56 there's the possibility
4493.49 of you going very, very
far down the ladder
4496.91 into very hypothermic territory
4499.22 and that can be very dangerous.
4500.78 Now, in terms of dealing with hangover
4502.4 when the alcohol has been
largely cleared from your system,
4505.22 well, that's where some of this old lore
4507.98 combines with some of the modern science
4510.14 and says, well, if you
can spike adrenaline,
4513.5 and certainly getting into an ice bath
4515.27 or getting into a cold shower
4516.89 or any kind of cold body of water,
4519.17 provided you can do that safely,
4520.4 that will sharply increase your adrenaline
4522.71 and, I should say, your dopamine.
4524.06 That's been shown
4524.893 and we've talked about
this on the podcast before.
4526.43 You get these long, extended increases,
4528.83 several hours of increases in dopamine
4530.45 from deliberate cold exposure.
4531.8 It's well-documented
in humans, by the way.
4534.23 So one could imagine using
deliberate cold exposure
4537.95 as a way to accelerate the
recovery from hangover.
4541.91 Provided that's done safely,
4543.32 I think there's no reason
to not explore that,
4545.54 and if you wonder what safely is
4547.91 and what temperatures to use,
4549.29 please check out the episode
on deliberate cold exposure.
4552.59 Cold showers, therefore,
might actually be one way
4555.89 to at least partially relieve hangover.
4557.69 Certainly the science from
various places in the literature
4561.29 converged to say that.
4562.34 But, again, be careful, please,
please, please be careful
4565.7 not to get into cold water
when you are inebriated.
4569.24 It's absolutely dangerous
for all the obvious reasons,
4572.24 and it's dangerous also
for the nonobvious reasons,
4574.73 not the least of which
4575.69 is the dramatic decreases
in core body temperature
4579.02 that can make you dangerously hypothermic.
4581.42 Now, how would you go about
using deliberate cold exposure
4583.7 to accelerate recovery from hangover?
4585.56 Well, there, I would look to
the kind of standard protocols
4588.44 of, you know, one to three minutes
4589.61 or maybe even six minutes
if you can tolerate it,
4591.26 or if you're really cold-adapted,
4593.3 maybe you do seven or ten
minutes in a cold shower,
4595.79 although that could be a lot.
4596.66 Most people are going to
experience a sharp increase
4600.32 in epinephrine, in adrenaline,
4601.67 and a long-lasting increase in dopamine
4604.25 from one to three minutes
of deliberate cold exposure,
4607.49 ideally done immersion up to the neck,
4609.23 again, do this safely,
please, please, please,
4611.33 or a cold shower where you're
getting under the shower
4613.25 as much as possible.
4614.083 How cold? Well, that's going
to vary person to person.
4616.73 I suggest making it as
cold as is uncomfortable
4619.55 such that you really want to get out
4620.93 but that you know you can stay in safely
4622.31 without, for instance, giving
yourself a heart attack,
4623.84 because if the water
is really, really cold,
4625.46 of course you can give
yourself a heart attack.
4626.75 Most showers won't go that cold,
4628.43 although probably some will.
4630.41 Again, please use caution.
4631.88 Spike your adrenaline, spike your dopamine
4633.62 with deliberate cold exposure safely.
4635.9 Other components of hangover
that could be good targets
4638.24 for trying to alleviate hangover,
4639.98 and, here, I hope you
are getting the picture
4642.02 because it is accurate
to say that hangover
4645.62 is a multifaceted phenomenon.
4647.78 It's not like one
molecule and one receptor.
4649.58 It's a bunch of things
happening in the brain and body.
4651.83 But is the dehydration
associated with alcohol?
4654.89 Alcohol is a diuretic.
4656.57 For multiple reasons, it causes people
4658.43 to excrete not only water but also sodium.
4661.91 Sodium is an electrolyte
4663.11 critical for the function of neurons,
4664.7 so making sure that
you have enough sodium,
4666.59 potassium, and magnesium,
so-called electrolytes,
4669.5 is going to be important
4670.94 for proper brain function,
bodily organ function.
4674.6 Even for people that have
just had one or two drinks
4676.67 the night before,
4677.503 it's likely that your electrolyte balance
4679.94 and your fluid balance
is going to be disrupted,
4682.34 and that's because alcohol also disrupts
4684.53 the so-called vasopressin pathway.
4686.36 I talked a lot about vasopressin
4688.52 and the way that it interacts with
4691.04 and controls different
aspects of water retention
4693.65 and water release from the
body in the form of urine
4696.23 in the episode on salt.
4698.24 So, again, I'm referring
to hubermanlab.com
4701.78 as the site where you
can find that episode
4703.25 on salt balance and ways to
restore electrolyte balance.
4706.16 Having your electrolytes
at the proper levels
4709.79 before you drink is ideal.
4711.38 Some people will say for
every glass of alcohol
4714.23 that you drink, you should
drink one glass of water.
4716.9 I would say better would
be two glasses of water
4720.08 given the dehydrating effects of alcohol,
4722.09 and even better would be
water with electrolytes.
4724.58 That certainly would set you up
4726.08 for a better day the next day.
4727.88 And if you don't manage to do that,
4729.667 'cause I suppose it's kind of geeky
4731.24 walking around with electrolyte packets
4733.46 out at the bar or whatnot,
4735.08 although, you know, geeky,
in my book, is a good thing,
4739.13 the next day, you could take
some electrolytes upon waking,
4742.58 maybe even some before you go to sleep
4744.71 the night of drinking.
4745.97 So hangover's made worse
by disturbed sleep,
4749.06 made worse by disrupted gut microbiome,
4750.89 made worse by disrupted electrolytes,
4753.05 made worse by the depletion
of epinephrine and dopamine.
4756.44 That's why replenishing the
microbiome with fermented foods,
4759.83 low-sugar fermented foods, that is,
4761.72 that's why using safe
deliberate cold exposure
4765.59 for spiking adrenaline and
for increasing dopamine,
4769.97 and that's why consuming electrolytes
4772.64 are all going to be beneficial.
4774.8 The folks over at examine.com,
a website that I really like
4778.49 because it just has so
much useful information,
4781.16 have assembled a list of things
4783.65 that have been proposed,
purported to improve,
4788.06 or, I should say, to remove
the effects of hangover,
4791.66 and, as they point out
4793.49 and I would like to point out over there,
4794.66 there isn't a lot of quality
science to support the idea
4797.93 that any one compound
can eliminate hangover.
4801.11 And that's probably because hangover,
4802.52 again, arises from multiple
organs and tissues and systems
4805.97 in both the brain and body.
4807.41 Nonetheless, they have a terrific
list over there of things,
4810.77 everything from Japanese pear fruit juice
4814.07 has been proposed to do this,
4815.33 to some other really esoteric things,
4817.61 even things like yohimbine.
4820.85 Frankly, when I look at the
literature there and elsewhere,
4825.56 one simply cannot find
the magic substance,
4829.19 the one herb, the one potion
that can wipe away hangover.
4833.84 Getting rid of hangover
4834.83 is going to be best solved
by doing a collection
4839.21 of a small number of very powerful things,
4841.79 of which I've already listed off a few.
4844.46 However, there are some additional things
4846.08 that one can do for relieving hangover,
4848.48 and one of them is to be very thoughtful
4851.87 about what sorts of alcohol one consumes.
4854.42 So I find this interesting.
4856.13 There have actually been studies
4857.72 of which types of alcohol lead
to the greatest hangovers.
4862.22 There's actually a lot of legend and lore
4864.08 about this as well.
4866.24 Some people have said, for instance,
4867.59 that drinks that have a high sugar content
4870.23 lead to greater hangovers.
4872.36 Turns out that's not the case,
4873.68 or at least that's not
what the science points to.
4875.75 If you look at the
expected hangover severity,
4878.81 what you find is that at
the bottom end of the scale,
4881.99 there's a drink that I'm not
going to tell you, for the moment,
4885.86 but what you find is that near
it is, for instance, beer.
4889.82 The consumption of beer,
4891.23 provided it is not overconsumption, right,
4893.66 it's not far beyond the
tolerance of the individual,
4896.87 so it's one or two beers,
4898.34 is less likely to cause a
hangover than, say, whiskey.
4902.66 And a glass of whiskey,
4904.28 or, you know, not as much
whiskey as beer, of course,
4906.92 but a glass of whiskey, for instance,
4908.51 is more likely to cause hangover
than gin, as it turns out.
4913.13 Again, this is what's
fallen out of the data.
4916.37 And yet a glass of rum or red wine
4920.12 is more likely to cause a hangover
4922.1 than any of the other things
I've mentioned so far.
4924.44 At the top, top, top of the list
4926.09 of drinks that induce hangover is brandy.
4929.0 And one could then say,
4930.747 "Well, doesn't brandy have a lot of sugar?
4932.66 Maybe it's the sugar
that's causing hangovers."
4934.46 And this is something that's been,
4935.72 again, discussed over and
over, that people say,
4937.467 "Oh, it's the high-sugar
drinks that cause hangover."
4939.92 It turns out, however,
4941.45 that when one looks at alcoholic drinks
4945.14 and sugar content and hangover,
4946.94 at the very bottom of the list is,
4950.12 gosh, this makes me cringe
just to think about,
4952.04 is ethanol diluted in orange juice.
4955.7 Ugh, I can't believe
people actually drink this,
4957.62 but ethanol diluted in orange juice.
4959.3 So this is not vodka
and orange juice, okay?
4961.43 Vodka was third on the
list from the bottom
4963.86 of drinks that induce hangover.
4965.36 Again, this is within amounts
4967.46 that are comfortable
for the person to drink,
4970.25 that they have enough experience with
4972.08 or that they have the
body weight to tolerate
4973.67 without getting very, very drunk.
4975.56 So the point is that if it were sugar
4978.68 that's causing hangover,
4979.76 well, then the ethanol
diluted in orange juice
4982.97 would probably be at the top of the list
4984.71 in terms of inducing hangover.
4986.3 But it's not, it's at
the bottom of the list,
4987.8 and brandy is at the top of the list.
4989.96 So what you find is that what scales
4992.96 from ethanol diluted in orange juice
4995.39 to beer to vodka to gin,
4996.68 here, I'm ascending the hierarchy
4998.09 of things that cause hangover,
4999.83 gin, white wine, whiskey, rum, red wine,
5002.2 and then brandy at the peak,
5004.15 it's sort of the world
heavyweight champion
5006.67 of hangover-inducing drinks,
5009.19 well, what's increasing are
congeners within those drinks.
5014.35 Congeners are things like
nitrites and other substances
5017.95 that give alcohol it's distinctive flavor
5021.76 and that also lead
5023.14 to some of the inebriating
effects of alcohol.
5026.92 Now, then you ask,
5027.753 "Okay, well, what is it that
these congeners are doing?
5030.88 And what are these nitrites doing?"
5032.2 And guess what?
5033.55 While they do have effects on the brain
5035.2 and on other tissues,
5037.09 their main effects are to
disrupt the gut microbiome.
5040.9 So what this points to again
5043.45 is that having a healthy gut microbiome
5045.91 and perhaps ensuring that you
bolster your gut microbiome
5051.58 the day after drinking
5052.63 is going to be especially
important for warding off hangover
5056.43 or at least reducing
the effects of hangover
5059.44 or the symptoms of hangover or both.
5061.6 I would love to see a study on this.
5064.12 I could imagine designing
the study myself,
5066.01 although this isn't
really the sorts of things
5067.66 my laboratory does,
5069.16 but can imagine some people
getting probiotic and prebiotic,
5072.55 some regularly, some just after drinking,
5075.18 or low-sugar fermented foods,
5077.23 and see what the effects are
5078.25 in terms of subjective effects of hangover
5080.68 but also some physiological measures.
5083.38 I think the way to think
about hangover overall
5085.81 is that, again, it
represents a multifaceted,
5090.16 multi-organ, multi-tissue phenomenon,
5094.06 and the best way to deal with it
5095.62 is as a multi-cell, multi-tissue,
multi-chemical phenomenon.
5099.88 And before I listed off some of the things
5101.41 that one could do in
order to adjust hangover,
5105.22 again, the one that comes
out at the top of that list,
5108.7 I believe, at least based
on my read of the data,
5110.92 is to support the gut microbiome
5113.44 and certainly not to ingest more alcohol.
5116.62 And I suppose if we were
to get really honest
5119.11 with one another
5120.55 and ask what's the best
way to avoid a hangover,
5123.4 it would be to not drink
in the first place.
5125.65 So we've covered the
major effects of alcohol
5128.2 that lead to this state
5129.52 that we call drunkenness or inebriation.
5133.33 Again, there's a range there.
5134.5 You can be tipsy, people
can be blackout drunk,
5137.23 people can be passed out drunk.
5140.26 We've also talked about hangover
5142.03 and the fact that it's a
multifaceted phenomenon
5144.55 and recovery from hangover
involves a multifaceted approach.
5149.68 Next I want to talk about tolerance.
5151.75 Tolerance to alcohol is a
very interesting phenomenon.
5154.48 It has roots mainly in the
brain and in brain systems.
5160.42 There's not time in the world,
5162.19 let alone within this podcast,
5163.6 to get into all the aspects of tolerance.
5165.58 There are more than 10
different types of tolerance.
5168.13 There's functional
tolerance, chronic tolerance,
5169.81 rapid tolerance, there's
metabolic tolerance,
5172.45 there's psychological tolerance.
5174.64 Let's keep it simple for
sake of today's discussion.
5176.74 And for those of you that are interested
5178.09 in learning about all the
different types of tolerance
5180.34 and aspects of tolerance,
there's an excellent review,
5183.73 we will provide a link to this.
5185.02 This was published in 2021,
so it's pretty recent,
5187.54 in the journal "Pharmacology
Biochemistry and Behavior."
5190.72 Incidentally, or not so incidentally,
5192.61 that was the first journal
I ever published in
5194.44 so I have a particular
affection for that journal.
5198.43 Nonetheless, it is called
Tolerance to alcohol:
5201.4 A critical yet understudied
factor in alcohol addiction.
5204.67 And while this paper
5206.71 does include alcohol
addiction in the title,
5210.1 it's not just about alcohol addiction.
5212.71 Here's the basic summary
of what tolerance is.
5214.81 First of all, tolerance
refers to the reduced effects
5217.87 of alcohol with repeated exposure,
5221.05 and it is caused mainly by changes
5223.3 in neurotransmitter systems in the brain
5226.15 that are the direct consequence
of the toxicity of alcohol,
5229.54 that aldehyde molecule that
we talked about before.
5232.69 There's an enormous number
of chemicals that change
5236.41 with repeated exposure to acetaldehyde,
5240.04 everything from GABA to
dopamine to serotonin,
5242.32 second messenger systems,
adenosine, and on and on.
5245.17 Rather than go into
each of those in detail,
5247.0 I just want to talk about the
contour of the reinforcing
5251.29 and the tolerance-inducing
effects of alcohol.
5253.39 What do I mean by that?
5254.68 Well, here we are back to our old friend,
5258.73 meaning the molecule that
comes up over and over again
5261.7 in these podcast episodes,
which is dopamine.
5264.91 Whether or not somebody
5265.743 has a predisposition to alcoholism or not,
5267.7 whether or not they're
experienced drinker or not,
5269.95 when people initially start drinking,
5271.24 there are increases in dopamine,
5273.22 or what we call dopaminergic transmission.
5275.26 Dopamine is involved in
motivation, in craving,
5278.29 it creates a sense of
well-being, it increases energy,
5281.26 again, typically only at the
beginning of alcohol exposure.
5285.28 That occurs in most people as
a sharp spike, as a increase.
5288.73 Again, if somebody does not
have alcohol dehydrogenase
5292.09 or has very low levels of the enzyme
5293.56 that convert that
acetaldehyde into acetate
5297.52 and that metabolize
alcohol, in other words,
5299.11 they will feel sick and lousy in a way
5301.69 that will override any recognition
of the dopamine release.
5304.45 They're going to be the people
that are listening to this
5306.19 and just thinking, "Alcohol
just makes me feel sick.
5308.17 I don't like it."
5309.22 Okay, that's a specific
subcategory of people,
5311.35 but most people experience
some sort of mild euphoria.
5315.07 That's why so many people drink, right?
5316.69 The current estimates are
that in most countries,
5318.67 and certainly in the US, as
many as 80% of the adult,
5322.6 legal drinking age
population drinks alcohol,
5325.99 and that number could be even higher now
5327.97 because in the last couple of years,
5329.32 there's been a trend towards
increased alcohol consumption,
5331.42 especially in the wake of the pandemic
5334.21 and during the pandemic.
5336.1 Topic for another time.
5337.81 So there's an increase in dopamine
5339.46 and an increase in serotonin,
5341.23 so it's kind of an increase in well-being,
5342.88 an increase in mood, but it's
a very short-lived increase.
5346.9 Very soon after, and actually
triggered by that increase,
5350.2 is a long and slow reduction
in dopamine and serotonin
5355.21 and related molecules in circuits.
5357.22 So basically what you're
getting is a blip of feel good
5359.68 followed by a long, slow
arc of feeling not so great,
5363.58 which is why, typically, people will drink
5365.11 again and again across the night.
5369.1 The key thing to
understand about tolerance
5371.83 is that with tolerance,
5374.32 the duration of that long, slow reduction
5378.04 in dopamine and serotonin
gets even longer.
5382.18 In other words, the
negative effects of alcohol
5384.7 that happen after the
initial feeling good,
5387.88 extend longer and, in
fact, get more robust.
5392.14 However, there's also a reduction
5395.53 in the reinforcing properties of alcohol.
5397.33 There's a shrinking of the feel good blip
5400.24 that happens when one
first ingests alcohol,
5402.427 and this has been measured
in animals and humans.
5404.86 So the first drink that somebody has,
5406.9 provided they have enough
alcohol dehydrogenase
5409.14 so that doesn't make them feel
nauseous and sick right away,
5411.85 they feel really good.
5413.86 And then as it wears off,
they feel kind of lousy
5415.81 and they want to drink more
so they might drink more.
5417.76 With each subsequent drink,
5418.96 and even drinks on different
nights or even different weeks,
5423.52 the amount of dopamine
that's released is reduced,
5426.73 the amount of serotonin
that's released is reduced.
5429.19 So what you're getting is less and less
5431.59 of the reinforcing properties of alcohol,
5434.59 the feel good stuff,
5436.27 and more and more
5437.35 of the punishment pain
signal aspects of alcohol.
5439.96 This is the contour of
chemical release in the brain
5445.39 that was referred to by my colleague,
5448.03 the incredible Dr. Anna
Lembke, who's a medical doctor.
5450.49 She wrote the incredible
book "Dopamine Nation."
5452.38 She was a guest on this
podcast, on Joe Rogan's podcast,
5454.87 on Rich Roll's podcast and
several other podcasts.
5457.6 World expert in addiction,
5458.8 and she talked about this
pleasure-pain balance
5461.26 that extends beyond alcohol
5463.12 to things like sex and
gambling and to other behaviors
5467.29 that can potentially become addictive
5469.03 but certainly includes alcohol.
5471.22 So tolerance, it seems, is
a process in which people
5475.63 are ingesting more and more alcohol
5478.15 as an attempt to get that
feeling of well-being back,
5482.5 but what they're really
getting is an extended period
5484.9 of punishment, of pain, and
of malaise from the alcohol.
5488.56 Now, you might say,
5489.393 "Well, how does that relate to tolerance?"
5490.99 Well, it turns out what
they do behaviorally,
5493.36 and when I say they,
5494.193 I mean animals do this and humans do this,
5495.94 is they start drinking more and more
5498.01 in an attempt to activate those dopamine
5500.62 and serotonin neurons and receptors,
5503.92 and as they do that,
5506.11 there is an increase in
alcohol dehydrogenase,
5508.72 so the enzyme that metabolizes
alcohol is increased
5511.51 because the body and liver
5512.77 have to contend with all that alcohol,
5514.96 so now you've got,
again, the two-hit model.
5517.06 You're getting less of
the feel good chemicals,
5518.77 more of the negative chemical release,
5521.11 or pattern of subjective
feeling, I should say,
5525.1 and you're metabolizing alcohol
5528.37 more quickly and more readily,
5529.93 but it's not taking you to a better place
5531.85 in terms of how you feel.
5533.2 That's one of the major underlying reasons
5535.36 for what we call tolerance.
5536.62 So if you're somebody who drinks
5537.85 and you notice that the feeling
5539.14 that you are seeking with alcohol
5541.36 is now requiring an additional
drink, or drinks plural,
5546.37 chances are you are
disrupting the dopamine
5549.25 and serotonergic systems of your brain,
5551.77 and you are doing that in a way
5553.81 that is increasing the
pain and punishment signals
5557.26 that follow alcohol ingestion.
5560.26 And again, that's not just on
the night that you're drinking
5562.09 but afterwards as well.
5563.74 Is that all bad news? Well, pretty much.
5566.14 But the good news is that
if you abstain from drinking
5569.08 for some period of time,
5570.88 then, of course, these systems reset.
5572.86 How long you need to abstain
5574.03 will depend on how much you were drinking
5575.74 and how long you were drinking for.
5576.88 Certainly people who
have alcohol use disorder
5578.607 or who are alcoholics,
5580.54 their main goal should be
to quit alcohol completely.
5582.85 I know there's some debate about this,
5584.38 and I don't want to get into that debate
5585.82 because I'm certainly not going to try
5587.44 and direct anyone's recovery.
5588.61 There are expert counselors and MDs
5592.45 and people that can work with people.
5593.86 In fact, for some very heavy drinkers
5595.93 and people with serious
alcohol use disorder,
5598.06 going cold turkey, that is,
stopping drinking completely,
5600.55 can actually be medically dangerous.
5602.53 So the path to sobriety for certain people
5605.53 looks different than the path
to sobriety for other people.
5607.81 What I'm referring to here
are people that are ingesting,
5610.72 again, somewhere between, on average,
5612.61 one to two drinks per night,
5614.65 whether or not that's done night to night
5616.48 or whether or not that's
condensed to weekend use.
5619.24 I know a number of
people are going to ask,
5621.16 perhaps are screaming, "Is
drinking good for me in any way?"
5625.09 For instance, many people
have probably heard
5627.07 that resveratrol is good for people
5629.107 and that red wine is rich in resveratrol.
5632.14 I hate to break it to you but the reality
5633.79 is that if indeed
resveratrol is good for us,
5637.39 and there's some debate about this,
5638.65 some people say strongly yes,
5639.94 some people say no,
other people say maybe,
5642.76 the amount of red wine that
one would have to drink
5646.12 in order to get enough resveratrol
5647.98 in order for it to be health promoting
5650.29 is so outrageously high
5651.82 that it would surely induce
other negative effects
5654.46 that would offset the positive
effects of resveratrol.
5657.31 So I wish I could tell you different.
5659.8 Again, I'm not here to be
the bearer of bad news,
5662.5 but the statement I just made
5663.91 was confirmed by Dr. David Sinclair
5665.89 when he was a guest on this podcast.
5667.6 It's confirmed by other researchers
5669.64 who work on resveratrol
and related pathways.
5673.15 I wish I could tell you
5673.983 that red wine is good for your health,
5675.43 and indeed it might be
through some other mechanisms.
5679.33 So, for instance, there have been studies
5681.03 of low to moderate red wine consumption.
5684.28 This would be anywhere from
one to four glasses per week.
5688.45 And I don't mean enormous glasses,
5690.22 I mean six-ounce glasses of red wine.
5693.19 And in those cases, some
of the stress reduction
5696.76 that can be induced by
consumption of red wine,
5699.31 maybe some of the other micronutrients
5701.92 and components within red wines,
5703.57 in particular red wines that
come from particular grapes,
5705.94 and this gets really nuanced
5707.59 and, frankly, is not well worked out
5709.66 in the peer-reviewed literature
5711.58 or certainly not clinical trials,
5713.71 at least not that I'm aware of.
5714.82 Tell me if you're aware of a
great clinical trial on this.
5717.49 Well, there may be some positive effects
5719.23 of that very low level of consumption.
5722.29 I'm not trying to take
away anybody's red wine.
5724.36 I'm not trying to take
away anybody's anything.
5727.57 I would be remiss, however,
if I didn't tell you
5732.01 that resveratrol as the
argument for drinking,
5736.27 and drinking red wine in particular,
5737.68 is just not a good one.
5739.09 It's just not supported by
the peer-reviewed research.
5742.21 A few other things about
alcohol and health.
5745.63 At the beginning of the
episode, I referenced a study
5747.85 showing that indeed not just
heavy alcohol consumption
5751.99 of 12 to 24 or more drinks per week,
5753.7 but also light to moderate
alcohol consumption of any type,
5757.45 wine, beer, spirits, et cetera,
5759.76 does reduce the thickness of the brain.
5763.27 It really does reduce cortical thickness.
5765.28 In fact, it actually scales
5767.68 with the amount of
alcohol that people drink,
5770.53 and this has been well-documented
5772.84 in a number of different studies.
5773.86 I can provide a link to several of these.
5776.17 One of the more striking
ones actually shows
5777.82 that there's almost a
dose-dependent increase
5781.36 in shrinkage of gray matter volume
5783.31 and in these white matter tracts,
5784.75 these axons, these wires, as it were,
5787.96 that connect different neurons
5789.88 as a function of how much
alcohol people drink.
5791.287 And that's also what's been
seen in this recent study
5794.14 that I referenced at the beginning
5795.22 and that's in the show note captions.
5797.02 So, again, probably the best
amount of alcohol to drink
5800.08 would be zero glasses per
week or ounces per week.
5803.65 For those of you drinking
low amounts of alcohol,
5805.72 make sure you're doing other
things to promote your health.
5808.99 And for those of you that
are drinking moderate
5811.81 and certainly for those of
you that are heavy drinkers,
5813.76 please do everything you
can to move away from that
5816.58 and to quit entirely.
5818.05 But even for the moderate
consumers of alcohol,
5821.56 you are going to want to be aware
5823.99 of some of the negative health effects
5825.19 and do things to offset those
5826.69 if indeed you're not
going to stop drinking
5829.27 or reduce your intake.
5830.53 One of the really bad effects of alcohol,
5832.99 but that's extremely well-documented,
5835.63 is the fact that alcohol,
because of this toxicity
5840.04 of acetaldehyde and the related pathways,
5842.62 can alter DNA methylation,
it can alter gene expression.
5846.25 That can mean many things
in different tissues,
5848.68 but it is associated
5851.32 with a significant
increase in cancer risk,
5854.74 in particular, breast cancer,
5856.45 and in particular, because
breast tissue is present
5859.54 in both males and females,
5860.53 but in women, it's especially vulnerable
5863.38 to some of the DNA methylation changes,
5865.84 well, breast cancer in women
5868.12 has a relationship to alcohol intake,
5869.86 and alcohol intake has a relationship
5871.33 to breast cancer in women.
5873.1 In fact, there has been proposed
5876.16 to be a anywhere from 4 to 13% increase
5881.14 in risk of breast cancer
5883.12 for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed.
5885.94 How much is 10 grams?
5887.17 Well, there, we need to think a little bit
5888.79 about the variation in
the amount of alcohol
5890.407 and different drinks across the world.
5892.3 Different countries serve
different sized drinks
5894.19 and have different concentrations
5895.27 of alcohol in those drinks.
5896.74 So without going down
too much of a rabbit hole
5899.02 and just giving you some good
rules of thumb to work with,
5901.84 there have been studies of
the percentage of alcohol
5905.05 included in different drinks
5906.13 and the sizes of different drinks
5907.48 that are served in different countries,
5908.65 and here's kind of a
patchwork of those findings.
5912.79 In Japan, one beer, one glass of wine,
5917.26 or one shot of liquor,
as it's served there,
5920.11 tends to include anywhere
5921.25 from seven to eight grams of alcohol.
5924.22 In the US, one beer, which
generally is 12 ounces
5928.3 if it's in a bottle,
5930.85 one glass of wine or a shot of liquor
5932.71 tends to include about 10
to 12 grams of alcohol.
5937.9 And in Russia, one drink
5941.31 of the various sorts that I just described
5944.65 typically will have as
much as 24 grams of alcohol
5949.09 because of the differences in
the concentration of alcohols
5952.81 and the sizes of drinks that are poured
5955.21 in these different countries, okay?
5956.86 Of course, there are other
countries in the world,
5958.24 those countries are
also vitally important,
5959.95 but those are the ones that
I extracted from the studies
5962.74 that I could find.
5965.2 What does this mean?
5966.033 Well, what we're talking about
5967.3 is that for every 10
grams of alcohol consumed,
5969.97 so that's one beer in the US,
5972.52 maybe a little bit more
than one beer in Japan,
5974.92 or basically a third of a drink in Russia,
5978.94 there's a 4 to 13%
increase in risk of cancer.
5984.94 That's pretty outrageous, right?
5986.65 And you might think,
"Wait, how could it be
5988.39 that, you know, this stuff is even legal?"
5990.67 Well, look, as I described
before, it's a toxin.
5994.06 It's also a toxin that
people enjoy the effects of.
5997.18 I mean, in the US at least,
they tried prohibition.
6000.45 It certainly did lead, yes,
did lead to a reduction
6004.62 in alcohol-induced health disorders,
6008.07 in particular, cirrhosis of the liver.
6009.51 It also led to a lot of crime
6011.22 because it became a substance
6013.02 that a lot of people still wanted
6015.09 and that people were
willing to break the law
6017.28 in order to provide, or, I
should say, to sell and provide.
6020.79 But the point is that the
more alcohol people drink,
6025.11 the greater their increase of cancer,
6026.52 in particular, breast cancer.
6027.357 And that's because of the fact
6029.7 that alcohol has these effects on cells
6033.51 that include changes in gene expression,
6036.57 and cancer, that is, the growth of tumors,
6039.42 is a dysregulation in cell cycles, right?
6042.21 A tumor is a aggregation
or the proliferation,
6045.54 aggregation is stuff sticking
together, by the way,
6047.58 proliferation is stuff duplicating,
6050.16 a proliferation or aggregation of cells
6053.01 that could be a glioma, glial cells,
6055.17 glioma brain tumor, right?
6056.928 It could be lymphoma, so within
the lymph tissue, et cetera.
6060.66 The mutations that alcohol
induces to cause this
6063.99 are wide ranging,
6065.31 some of those are
starting to be understood.
6067.29 For those of you that are
interested in cell biology,
6069.0 I'll just mention that the PD-1 pathway,
6071.55 again, this is super specialized
6074.19 and for the aficionados only,
you don't need to know this,
6077.22 the PD-1 pathway seems
to be upregulated and,
6079.74 and we knew this from
the discussion earlier,
6081.9 there's a downregulation
6083.49 in some of the anti-inflammatory molecules
6087.78 that help suppress this
proliferation of cancers.
6091.41 Nowadays, there's a lot
of interest in the fact
6093.36 that the immune system is
constantly combating cancers
6097.38 that exist in us all the time.
6098.73 You know, little tumors start growing
6100.65 and our immune system
goes and gobbles them up.
6102.69 Little tumors start growing,
6104.04 the immune system senses inflammation,
6105.93 sends out these incredible cells,
6107.34 these killer B-cells and
T-cells, and beats them up.
6111.36 Cancers proliferate and take
hold and cause serious problems
6115.2 when the proliferation of cells
6117.3 exceeds the immune system's ability
6119.46 to gobble up and remove those cells.
6120.96 There are other mechanisms
of regulating cancers,
6122.97 but that's one of the primary one.
6124.26 And alcohol hits it. Again,
it's a two hit model.
6127.26 It increases tumor growth
6129.15 and it decreases the sorts of molecules
6132.66 that suppress and combat tumor growth.
6135.3 So, again, even low to
moderate amounts of alcohol
6138.75 can be problematic for sake of cancers,
6140.7 in particular, breast cancers.
6143.4 Epidemiologists and health specialists
6146.13 love to try and compare
different substances
6148.71 in terms of how bad they are.
6150.3 Rarely do they compare substances
6152.31 in terms of how good they
are, but sometimes they do.
6155.73 And what they'll sometimes tell you
6158.07 and what you can find in the literature
6159.36 is that ingesting 10 to
15 grams of alcohol a day,
6162.66 so that would be like one beer in the US
6164.18 or one glass of wine,
6165.51 is the same as smoking
10 cigarettes a day.
6168.54 Frankly, it's hard to make
that direct relationship
6173.07 really stick because,
you know, it's a question
6175.56 of, you know, how long people inhale,
6177.27 do they have a predisposition
to a lung cancer, et cetera.
6180.63 But even if that number is off
6183.45 by plus or minus two cigarettes,
6186.69 or even if that number was the equivalent
6189.57 of one glass of wine equals
one cigarette per day...
6192.3 I think there's general consensus now
6194.49 that nicotine consumed by
vaping or by cigarette,
6198.54 it's bad for us in terms of lung cancer
6202.56 and other forms of cancer.
6204.03 And for some reason, I don't know why,
6206.55 because this knowledge
about alcohol and cancer
6209.43 and these established relationships
6211.71 have been known since the late 1980s.
6213.93 The first, you know,
landmark paper on this
6216.27 was published in 1987.
6217.68 I can provide a link to that paper.
6218.85 It's actually quite interesting to read.
6221.85 Well, the relationship is there
6225.27 and yet we don't often
hear about it, right?
6227.46 In fact, before researching this episode,
6229.59 I had heard before that alcohol
can increase cancer risk
6232.98 but I wasn't aware of just how
strong that relationship is.
6236.31 Because of the serious nature
of what we're talking about
6238.83 and because I would hate to be confusing
6241.83 or misleading to anybody,
6243.21 I want to just emphasize
that this statistic,
6245.79 that there is a 4 to 13%,
6247.89 depending on which study you look at,
6249.3 a 4 to 13% increase in the risk of cancer,
6252.51 in particular, breast cancer,
6253.71 for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed,
6257.25 that's 10 grams per day, so
that's one drink per day.
6260.85 But I do want to emphasize
6263.01 that if that equates to
seven drinks per week
6267.24 and all those seven drinks
6269.13 are being consumed on Friday and Saturday,
6271.2 it still averages to 10 grams per day.
6273.84 And I also want to emphasize
that there are things
6276.18 that people can do to at
least partially offset
6278.76 some of the negative effects of alcohol
6280.92 as it relates to
predisposition to the formation
6284.4 of certain kinds of tumors and cancers.
6287.49 I also want to be clear before I say it
6289.53 that doing the things
I'm about to tell you
6292.02 is not a guarantee that you're
not going to get cancer,
6295.83 nor is it a guarantee that
alcohol is not going to lead
6299.94 to an increased predisposition
for certain kinds of cancers,
6303.9 and the two things are
consumption of folate
6307.26 and other B vitamins, especially B12.
6310.47 You know, the consumption
of folate and B12
6314.58 has been shown to decrease cancer risk
6317.04 in people that ingest alcohol,
but not completely offset it.
6321.54 Why that is isn't exactly clear.
6323.46 It probably has something
to do with the relationship
6326.01 between folate and B12
and other B vitamins
6329.82 in gene regulation pathways
that can lead to tumor growth.
6334.02 At some point soon, we will get
an expert in cancer biology,
6337.14 and, in particular, in breast
cancer biology, on the program
6340.83 and we can ask them about this.
6342.45 But I realize this is going
to raise a number of questions
6345.21 and maybe even cause some
of you to go out there
6347.4 and start taking folate and
other B vitamins and B12.
6351.72 Not incidentally, a lot of the
reported hangover supplements
6357.51 and treatments include folate and B12.
6360.39 I don't know if they had the
cancer literature in mind
6362.88 when they created those
supplements and products.
6366.06 I doubt they did.
6367.92 Alcohol really does
disrupt B vitamin pathways,
6371.28 both synthesis pathways
and utilization pathways,
6374.28 so sometimes you'll hear,
6375.337 "Oh, you know, if you get your B vitamins,
6376.83 it helps you recover from
hangover more quickly."
6380.34 Again, the literature
doesn't support that,
6382.47 but also again, there
aren't a lot of studies.
6384.6 But more to the point
as it relates to alcohol
6387.897 and the formation of tumors and cancers,
6390.06 it does appear that decreased folate
6393.15 and other B vitamins like
B12 are partially responsible
6396.78 for the effect of alcohol
in increasing cancer risk.
6400.98 And it does appear that
consuming adequate amounts
6405.27 of folate in B12 might,
6407.04 again, might partially,
6408.93 really want to bold face
6410.07 and underline and highlight partially,
6411.9 offset some of that increased risk.
6414.36 There's an additional category
6415.77 that I want to highlight, of course,
6418.2 and this is vitally important to state
6421.2 even though it's obvious,
6422.61 which is that people who are pregnant
6425.43 should absolutely not consume alcohol.
6429.12 Fetal alcohol syndrome is well known
6432.39 and established, it's terrible.
6434.34 Fetuses experience
diminished brain development
6438.18 that's often permanent,
6439.68 diminished limb development,
6441.15 diminished organ development
in the periphery,
6443.07 meaning, you know, the heart,
the lungs, liver, et cetera.
6445.68 Ingesting alcohol while
pregnant is simply a bad idea.
6448.89 And the reason I say this at all
6450.72 is, first of all, it's
important to include
6453.33 in an episode like this,
6454.26 but also because we
can look at two things.
6457.95 First of all, we can look at mechanism
6459.45 and then we can also
look at some of the lore
6462.03 that still sadly exists out there.
6464.94 Let's take care of the lore
that sadly exists first.
6468.42 If you look online,
6470.76 you will sometimes be able to find, sadly,
6474.48 that some people believe
that certain kinds of alcohol
6478.53 are not detrimental to fetuses.
6480.39 They'll say, "Well, champagne is safe
6482.55 for a pregnant mother to
drink but beer is not."
6485.37 That is absolutely categorically
false. Alcohol is alcohol.
6489.9 There is no evidence whatsoever
6492.03 that consuming certain types of alcohol
6493.74 is safer for fetuses than others.
6495.6 Alcohol is a toxin,
6496.68 and the reason fetal
alcohol syndrome exists
6499.17 is because the ability of that toxin
6502.02 to disrupt cellular processes.
6504.21 Remember tumor growth
and the way that alcohol
6507.33 can accelerate tumor growth
by proliferation of cells,
6510.78 the wrong cells, the ones you
don't want to proliferate?
6513.57 Well, all of embryonic development,
6515.43 all of fetal development,
6517.29 it's not the growth of a tumor,
6518.4 it's obviously the growth of an embryo,
6519.99 and it's done in a very orchestrated way.
6523.47 I started off studying brain development.
6525.15 That's where I got my
beginnings in neurobiology,
6527.76 and I still teach embryology
6529.8 to medical students and graduate students.
6532.5 The set of coordinated processes
6535.14 that has to take place
from conception to birth
6538.32 in order to give rise to a healthy embryo
6540.48 is so, so dynamically controlled
and so exquisitely precise,
6545.91 with checkpoints and recovery mechanisms
6547.98 and redundancy in the
genes that are expressed
6550.38 to make sure that if anything goes wrong,
6551.97 it's repaired, et cetera.
6553.77 Alcohol as a mutagen, I
haven't used that word yet,
6557.67 but a substance that can mutate DNA
6561.09 through alterations in DNA methylation
6563.19 in these checkpoints in the cell cycle,
6565.32 alcohol as a mutagen is
one of the worst things
6569.34 that a developing embryo
can be exposed to.
6571.8 And, again, because it's
water-soluble and fat-soluble,
6574.92 ingestion of alcohol
when people are pregnant
6576.72 passes right to the fetus.
6579.09 Now, I realize that a
number of people out there
6581.58 might be thinking, "Oh goodness,
6582.413 you know, I didn't realize I was pregnant
6585.18 until a certain stage of pregnancy,
6586.95 and before I realized, I
was ingesting alcohol."
6590.1 Obviously, one can't
undo what's been done,
6593.94 but I want to also emphasize
that fetal alcohol syndrome,
6597.21 while, yes, there's a full-blown syndrome
6599.58 that manifests as changes in
the cranial facial development
6602.1 that are very obvious,
and you can look these up,
6603.96 you've probably seen these before,
6604.85 or the pictures before, rather,
6606.75 it has to do with eye
spacing, forehead size,
6608.7 a number of other features
6609.69 of the cranial facial development,
6611.76 and of course stuff's
going on in the brain too,
6613.65 it's along a continuum.
6615.42 So it is possible that some
of the changes that occur
6618.9 are more minor,
6620.07 and, thankfully, the young brain,
6622.74 in particular, the early postnatal brain,
6624.57 is incredibly plastic.
6625.65 There are things that can be done
6626.85 in order to help recover neural circuits
6628.8 that didn't develop well, et cetera.
6631.83 But even though it's somewhat
obvious, or should be obvious,
6636.21 I really want to make clear
6637.65 that there's zero evidence whatsoever
6639.06 that certain forms of alcohol
6640.35 are safer for pregnant
women to ingest than others.
6642.51 Absolutely wrong, no one who's pregnant
6644.94 should be ingesting alcohol whatsoever.
6648.0 And certainly, if people feel
6650.1 like they can't avoid
alcohol while pregnant,
6652.32 they really need to work with somebody
6654.12 to make sure that it just
absolutely doesn't happen
6655.95 because it is so detrimental
to the developing fetus.
6658.86 Lastly, I want to talk
6659.82 about the effects of alcohol on hormones,
6662.07 and I want to distinguish
6663.9 between low amounts of alcohol intake,
6666.48 higher amounts of alcohol intake,
6668.01 and, again, this chronic alcohol intake
6669.96 versus occasional use
versus really chronic use,
6673.62 meaning alcoholic or
alcoholic use disorder,
6676.59 where people are drinking
an immense amount
6678.36 on an ongoing basis.
6680.43 The literature on alcohol and
hormones is quite extensive,
6683.19 and there are, of course,
6684.023 many, many different types of hormones.
6685.38 The hormones that most often get mentioned
6688.02 and talked about on this podcast
6689.25 are the hormones
testosterone and estrogen,
6691.02 which are present in both men and women
6692.287 and that, in both men and women,
6694.2 are important for things like libido,
6698.31 they're also responsible
for sexual development,
6700.38 actual development of the genitalia
6702.57 before birth and after birth,
6703.95 they're responsible, for
instance, estrogen is important
6706.17 for memory and cognition.
6707.4 You never want to drop estrogen
too low in men or women
6709.86 'cause it can disrupt cognition
and joint health, et cetera.
6714.57 To keep this discussion
relatively constrained,
6716.85 it's fair to say that alcohol,
6719.19 and, in particular, the
toxic metabolites of alcohol,
6723.36 increase the conversion of
testosterone to estrogen.
6727.68 Now, this occurs in a
number of different tissues.
6730.65 This is not just occurring
in the testes of males,
6732.78 this is occurring in lots
of different tissues.
6734.34 And I'll refer you to a excellent review.
6736.44 We'll provide a link in
the show note captions.
6738.33 This is a paper that was
published in the year 2000
6741.33 but the data are still quite strong.
6743.487 The journal is called,
of all things, "Alcohol,"
6748.56 yes, literally a journal called "Alcohol"
6751.17 for the publication of data and reviews
6753.57 on alcohol and its effects,
6754.95 and the title of the paper is
6756.03 Can alcohol promote aromatization
of androgens to estrogens?
6759.36 Aromatization is this
process of the conversion
6761.67 of testosterone and other
androgens to estrogens
6764.64 through things like aromatase enzyme.
6766.77 And this is a beautiful review
6768.78 that describes every tissue,
or near every tissue,
6772.86 from the ovary in females to the placenta
6776.19 to the liver to the testes,
6778.44 in which alcohol can
increase the aromatization
6782.94 of testosterone to estrogen.
6784.11 Now, in females, this
may be part of the reason
6786.69 why there's an increase in
estrogen-related cancers.
6789.78 Breast cancer can be
either estrogen-related
6792.06 or non-estrogen-related,
6793.17 there are other types of
estrogen-related cancers
6794.94 outside of breast cancer,
6796.77 but it appears that one reason why alcohol
6799.11 increases the risk of breast cancer
6800.79 is because of this aromatization from,
6803.7 of testosterone, excuse me, to estrogen.
6806.58 In males, accelerated
or abnormal conversion
6811.74 of testosterone to estrogen
6812.94 can actually lead to growth
of the breast tissue in males,
6815.52 so-called gynecomastia, or
other effects of high estrogen,
6819.84 or I should say of altered
testosterone-estrogen ratios,
6823.32 'cause that's really what's important.
6825.45 And these can include things
like diminished sex drive,
6828.9 increased fat storage, and
a number of other things
6831.6 that I think most people would
find to be negative effects.
6836.46 I once talked about the
fact that drinking alcohol
6838.68 can increase the aromatization
of testosterone to estrogen.
6841.26 I posted that online,
6842.55 and I didn't get attacked
but I did get criticized
6846.96 for the fact that it has been shown,
6848.91 yes, has been shown,
6849.96 that small amounts of alcohol ingestion,
6851.82 so five grams or so of alcohol ingestion,
6854.13 this would be half a glass of
wine or half a glass of beer,
6856.44 at least in some studies showed
increases in testosterone,
6859.8 which was kind of surprising.
6861.21 But I should point out,
6862.38 other studies have shown
that alcohol ingestion
6865.59 causes decreases in
testosterone over time.
6869.19 So there's always this issue
6870.66 of whether or not you're
looking at a study
6871.68 of acute exposure versus chronic exposure,
6873.891 you know, one dose versus
multiple doses and exposure.
6877.98 I think it's fair to say,
6879.57 based on my read of the literature,
6881.04 this review and other reviews
6882.72 that focus more particularly on humans,
6885.06 that regular ingestion of alcohol
6887.25 is going to increase estrogen levels
6889.59 whether or not you're male or female,
6890.91 and it's largely doing that
6892.35 through the aromatization process,
6894.24 by increasing the aromatase enzyme.
6897.39 Yes, there's some dose dependence,
6899.07 but I think if you're
somebody who's trying
6900.48 to optimize your
testosterone-to-estrogen ratio,
6903.27 regardless of whether or
not you're male or female,
6905.34 well then most certainly
6906.3 you're going to want to avoid
drinking too much alcohol.
6909.48 So we've covered a lot of topics
6911.49 and data related to the
mechanisms of alcohol,
6914.82 hangover, tolerance,
cancer risk, et cetera.
6918.21 I acknowledge that I've
mainly talked to you
6920.01 about the negative effects of alcohol.
6922.83 I want to acknowledge that
many people enjoy alcohol
6926.61 in moderation or even light drinking,
6930.15 the occasional drink or
the occasional two drinks
6932.79 or maybe even, on average,
one drink per night,
6935.43 so seven drinks per week.
6937.14 I'm certainly not here
to tell you what to do
6939.18 and what not to do.
6940.8 I do find it immensely
interesting, however,
6943.71 that, first of all,
alcohol is a known toxin
6946.8 to the cells of the body.
6947.94 Some of you might immediately say,
6949.057 "Well, wait, what about hormesis?
6950.55 What about this phenomenon
6951.54 where if we regularly ingest a
toxin, it makes us stronger?"
6954.84 In other words, what doesn't
kill us makes us stronger.
6957.12 Yeah, there's, you know,
some reason to believe
6959.37 that might be beneficial
6960.81 in terms of some forms of
cellular resilience maybe, maybe.
6964.98 No, sorry. It doesn't work that way.
6967.68 There are processes of hormesis
6969.96 in which, for instance,
exposing yourself safely
6973.2 through increases in adrenaline
through, you know, ice baths
6976.2 or other things that increase adrenaline
6977.85 can raise your so-called stress threshold,
6980.13 but here, we're talking
about cellular stress
6982.74 and damage to cells.
6984.81 So my read of the literature,
6986.43 and, again, this is my read
6987.96 and I invite others to,
you know, provide studies
6990.84 or I would prefer actually
collections of studies
6993.27 that point in the
direction, if they exist,
6995.91 that alcohol can be beneficial,
6999.12 but my read of the literature,
7001.13 or I should say my understanding
7003.14 of what I would call the center of mass
7005.09 of the literature on alcohol
7007.22 is that no consumption, zero consumption,
7010.7 consumption of zero ounces of alcohol
7013.88 is going to be better for your health
7016.01 than low to moderate
consumption of alcohol,
7019.19 and that low to moderate
consumption of alcohol
7022.37 is going to be better for you, of course,
7024.38 than moderately high to
high alcohol consumption
7028.52 on the order of 12 to 24
or more drinks per week.
7033.2 I realize that for most
people listening to this,
7035.69 it's probably low to
moderate alcohol consumption
7039.71 that is part of their standard repertoire,
7043.07 and I'm not here to give you
justification for doing that
7046.4 nor am I going to tell you not to do that.
7048.38 I would like you to
consider perhaps, however,
7051.56 the negative effects that we understand
7053.96 and that are documented.
7054.83 For instance, the negative effects
7056.54 of alcohol on the gut microbiome
7058.85 and the things that you can do
7060.53 to better support your gut microbiome,
7062.63 the negative effects on the stress system,
7065.03 that HPA axis that we
talked about earlier,
7067.19 and the fact that even
low to moderate levels
7069.62 of alcohol consumption
7070.58 can increase our levels of
stress when we're not drinking,
7073.91 and to think about acquiring some tools
7077.39 and, you know, getting some
proficiency with tools,
7080.12 behavioral or otherwise,
7081.17 that can help you with stress modulation
7083.3 that don't involve alcohol consumption.
7086.0 Again, the point here is to illustrate
7089.03 where the problems lie
with alcohol consumption,
7091.13 but, also, what I've tried to do
7093.26 is to point you to some resources
7094.7 that can help offset some
of those negative effects.
7097.37 Will they offset all the effects?
7099.44 I can't say that for sure,
7100.97 but certainly taking measures
7104.06 to offset some of the negative effects
7105.65 of any alcohol consumption that
you might be having or doing
7109.67 is going to be beneficial to you.
7111.56 And those tools and protocols
7112.79 are going to be
health-promoting in any case.
