0.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the Huberman Lab podcast,
2.22 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.89 for everyday life.
9.13 I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor
10.9 of neurobiology
and ophthalmology
13.06 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.74 Today, my guest is
Dr. Layne Norton.
17.02 Dr. Norton is one of
the foremost experts
19.12 in protein metabolism,
fat loss, and nutrition.
22.21 He did his degrees in
biochemistry and nutritional
24.85 sciences and is considered
one of the world experts
27.82 in understanding how we
extract energy from our food
30.97 and how exercise and what we
eat combine to impact things
35.38 like body composition
and overall health.
38.21 Today, we discuss an
enormous number of topics
40.42 under the umbrella of
nutrition and fitness,
42.73 including, for instance,
what is energy balance?
45.85 That is, how do we actually
extract energy from our food?
49.43 We also discuss the
somewhat controversial topic
51.82 of artificial sweeteners,
whether or not
53.62 they are safe or not
and whether or not
55.245 they are an effective
tool for weight loss,
57.19 in particular, for
people suffering
58.72 from obesity and different
types of diabetes.
61.54 We also talk about gut health--
that is the gut microbiome--
64.84 and how it's impacted
by food and how
66.82 it can actually impact the
metabolism of the foods
69.49 that we eat.
70.4 We also discuss fasting, or
so-called intermittent fasting
73.48 or time-restricted
feeding, what it does
75.79 and what it does not do in
terms of how effective it
79.21 is for weight loss and, perhaps,
even for health and longevity.
82.54 We also talk about protein
and define very clearly
85.33 how much protein each
and all of us need,
87.49 depending on our daily
activities and life demands.
90.43 We discuss the
various types of diets
92.145 that you've probably
heard about,
93.52 including ketogenic diets,
vegan diets, vegetarian diets,
97.66 and pure carnivore diets, as
well as more typical omnivore
100.39 diets, and how to
make sure that you
102.19 get all of the
essential amino acids
104.41 that are critical for healthy
weight maintenance, weight
107.23 loss, or directed muscle gain.
109.54 We also talk about supplements,
in particular, the supplements
112.45 for which there is an immense
amount of science pointing
115.33 to their safety and
efficacy for fitness
118.6 and for overall
body composition.
120.515 What I'm sure will
become clear to you,
122.14 as you hear Layne
talk about each
123.515 and every one of
these topics, is
125.32 that he has an incredible
ability to both understand
128.11 the mechanistic science
but also the real world
130.81 applications of the various
discoveries that are made
133.87 in particular papers
and, in particular,
136.63 in the randomized
controlled trials.
138.37 That is when a given scientific
hypothesis has been raised.
143.11 He's extremely good at
understanding why it was raised
146.2 but also at evaluating
whether or not
148.54 it works in the
real world, which
150.16 is what I believe most everybody
out there is concerned with.
153.475 I think this is one of
the things that really
155.35 distinguishes him
from the other voices
157.36 in the nutritional landscape.
159.1 I assure you that by the
end of today's discussion,
161.5 you will have a much clearer
understanding about what
164.35 the science says about
nutrition, about fitness,
168.01 and about how different diets
and fitness programs combine
171.82 to achieve the
results that you want.
173.8 Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize
175.602 that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research
178.06 roles at Stanford.
179.11 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
181.36 to bring zero cost to
consumer information
183.34 about science and
science-related tools
185.53 to the general public.
186.76 In keeping with
that theme, I'd like
188.32 to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.
190.73 Our first sponsor is LMNT.
192.61 LMNT is an electrolyte drink
with everything you need
195.61 and nothing that you don't.
196.9 That means it contains
sodium, potassium,
199.52 and magnesium, the so-called
electrolytes, but no sugar.
202.895 As you may have heard
me discuss before
204.52 on this podcast, every
cell in our body,
206.952 and in particular
cells within our brain,
208.66 the so-called neurons
or nerve cells,
210.34 critically rely on the
presence of electrolytes--
213.65 sodium, magnesium, and
potassium-- in order
216.25 to function properly.
217.85 I, myself, am a big believer
in consuming electrolytes
220.623 any time I've been
sweating a lot,
222.04 so that could be
after during exercise
224.29 or after doing the sauna.
225.76 So by drinking electrolytes in
the form of LMNT electrolyte
229.06 mix, I'm able to replenish
those electrolytes
231.58 and maintain mental clarity
and energy throughout the day.
234.67 LMNT contains a science
back to electrolyte
236.68 ratio of 1,000 milligrams
of sodium, 200 milligrams
239.98 of potassium, and 60
milligrams of magnesium.
243.19 If you'd like to try an LMNT,
you can go to drinklmnt--
245.83 spelled L-M-N-T-- .com/huberman
to get a free sample pack with
250.57 your purchase.
251.17 Again, that's
drinkL-M-N-T.com/huberman
255.04 to get the free sample pack.
256.66 Today's, episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
259.12 ROKA makes eyeglasses
and sunglasses
261.37 that are of the absolute
highest quality.
263.5 The company was founded by
two all-American swimmers
265.69 from Stanford.
266.56 And everything about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses
269.11 were designed with
performance in mind.
271.12 I've spent a lifetime working on
the biology, the visual system,
274.04 and I can tell you that
your visual system has
275.56 to contend with an enormous
number of challenges in order
278.05 for you to see clearly,
for instance, when you move
280.175 from a sunny area
to a shady area
281.55 and back again, whether or not
you're looking at something up
284.092 close or often to the distance.
285.43 ROKA understands the
biology of the visual system
287.86 and has designed their
eyeglasses and sunglasses
290.08 accordingly so you always
see with perfect clarity.
292.84 ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses were initially
295.03 designed for activities
such as running and cycling.
298.277 And indeed, they are
very lightweight.
299.86 Most of the time, I
can't even remember
301.27 that they're on my face.
302.2 They're so lightweight.
303.158 But the important thing to
know about ROKA eyeglasses
305.38 and sunglasses is
that while they
307.03 can be used during
sports activities,
309.5 they also have a
terrific aesthetic
311.57 and they can be used just as
well for wearing to work or out
315.17 to dinner, et cetera.
316.37 If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses,
318.95 you can go to roka--

329.63 Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
332.57 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition program
335.36 that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA
337.94 to help you better
understand your body
339.68 and help you reach
your health goals.
341.438 Now, I've long been a believer
in getting regular blood
343.73 work done for the simple reason
that many of the factors that
346.88 impact your immediate
and long-term health
348.8 can only be analyzed with
a quality blood test.
351.5 One of the major issues
with a lot of blood and DNA
353.75 tests out there, however, is
that you get information back
357.2 about levels of hormones,
levels of lipids,
360.17 levels of metabolic
factors, but you
361.835 don't know what to do
about that information.
363.71 With InsideTracker, they
have an easy-to-use platform
366.53 that allows you to
assess those levels
368.48 and then determine what
sorts of behavioral changes
370.92 and nutritional changes,
maybe, even supplementation
373.34 changes you might
want to make in order
375.088 to bring those numbers
into the ranges that
376.88 are optimal for you.

390.11 The Huberman Lab
podcast is now partnered
391.82 with Momentous supplements.
392.99 To find the supplements we
discuss on the Huberman Lab
395.24 podcast, you can go to
livemomentous-- spelled O-U-S--
398.15 livemomentous.com/huberman.
400.42 And I should just
mention that the library
402.17 of those supplements is
constantly expanding.
404.3 Again, that's
livemomentous.com/huberman.
407.36 And now, for my discussion
with Dr. Layne Norton.
410.3 Layne, Dr. Norton, thank
you so much for being here.
412.95 This is a long time coming.
414.15 And I have to say, I'm really
excited because I've seen you
417.32 in the social media sphere.
419.33 I've also listened to a
number of your other podcasts.
421.68 And as a fellow PhD scientist,
I feel a great kinship with you.
426.47 I know you have
tremendous experience
429.11 in fitness and nutrition,
a number of areas.
431.7 We also got a lot of
questions from our audience.
434.61 And I'm really looking forward
to talking with you today.
437.168 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah,
I'm excited, too.
438.71 I mean, like you said,
it's been something
440.09 we've been talking
about for a long time.
441.48 So I was glad we were
able to make it happen.
443.07 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, indeed.
444.32 And I think some
of the audience has
446.33 requested a debate or a battle.
448.22 And I can tell you right now,
it's not going to happen.
450.53 Actually, one of the things that
brought Layne and I together,
454.43 in conversation online and
then via text, et cetera,
458.06 was the fact that I
love to be corrected,
463.528 and that's what happened.
464.57 I did a post about
artificial sweeteners, which
467.39 we will talk about a little
bit later in the episode,
469.82 and Layne pointed out some areas
of the study that I had missed
474.92 or, maybe, even misunderstood.
477.26 And I revised my opinions
and I think it's wonderful.
480.238 And other studies have
come out since then.
482.03 So hopefully, our
conversation will
484.28 serve as a message of how
science and actionable science
489.44 can be perceived and
that it doesn't always
492.747 have to be a battle.
493.58 But hey, if we get into
it, we get into it.
496.19 It won't get physical because
we know you would win.
498.66 So in any case, I'd like
to start with something
502.64 that's rather basic and
yet can be pretty complex,
506.21 and that's this issue of energy
balance and energy utilization.
510.35 I think most people
have heard of a calorie.
513.26 I am assuming that most
people don't actually
515.84 know what that is in
terms of how it works,
519.48 what it represents.
520.679 And so maybe you
could just explain
522.89 for people what happens when
we eat food, of any kind,
527.39 and how is that
actually converted
529.1 into energy, as a way of framing
up the discussion around weight
533.18 loss, weight maintenance, weight
gain, and body composition.
536.955 LAYNE NORTON: So it's
a great question.
538.58 And like you said, this is one
of those things where people
541.1 use the term calories
in, calories out,
542.75 and they say, well,
that's way too simplistic.
545.56 I'm like, if you look at what
actually makes up calories in,
548.9 calories out, it's
actually very complicated.
551.99 So let's deal with what
you mentioned first.
556.55 What is the calorie?
557.6 Because I think a lot of people
don't quite understand this.
561.05 So a calorie just refers to
a unit of energy, of heat
565.46 specifically.
566.82 And so what does that
have to do with food?
568.67 What does that have to do
with what we digest and eat?
573.35 Really, what you're
talking about
574.88 is the potential
chemical energy that
578.06 is in the bonds of the
macronutrients of food.
581.39 And by digesting,
assimilating, and metabolizing
586.1 those nutrients, we
are able to create
588.83 energy and the in-product
of that, mostly,
593.33 is ATP, adenosine triphosphate,
which is your body's energy
598.85 currency.
599.57 So to understand ATP,
just try to think about--
604.28 if you're trying to power
these various reactions
607.01 in your body--
608.262 and we're talking
about tens of thousands
609.97 of enzymes that require ATP--
614.26 it doesn't make
sense that you would
616.21 have to create a bunch
of micro explosions.
619.3 You want something that can
transfer high-energy phosphates
623.98 to power these
reactions, to give up
626.47 essentially its energy
to power something
628.72 that might otherwise
be unfavorable.
631.74 So a lot of metabolism
is simply creating
636.62 ATP, which the end
of the line of that--
640.88 I'm going to work
backwards-- is what's
643.19 called oxidative respiration.
645.75 So that happens in
the mitochondria.
647.54 Everybody's heard mitochondria,
a powerhouse of the cell.
650.16 And that is done through
essentially creating a hydrogen
654.83 ion gradient across
the mitochondria, which
657.62 powers the production
of ATP by converting
660.77 free phosphate plus ATP to ADP.
664.58 Now the way that hydrogen
ion gradient is created
667.73 is through creating hydrogen
ions that can be donated
673.01 through the Krebs cycle.
675.18 Now the Krebs cycle is
linked to glycolysis.
677.76 So if we talk about
carbohydrate metabolism,
680.03 carbohydrates basically,
other than fructose,
684.14 get converted into glucose,
which can go into glycolysis,
688.22 and you can produce some
ATPs through glycolysis.
690.86 And then it boils
down to pyruvate,
693.5 then acetyl-CoA, which
goes to the Krebs cycle,
696.08 produces a lot more
ATPs from that.
699.35 If you talk about
protein, protein
701.285 is a little bit different
because protein gets converted
704.45 to amino acids,
which can be used
706.13 for muscle protein
synthesis or protein
708.86 synthesis in other tissues.
710.84 But it also can be converted
through gluconeogenesis
713.36 to glucose.
714.71 And there also are some
ketogenic amino acids as well.
718.86 And so you can have
a few different ways
721.61 to get to the Krebs cycle.
723.17 Either being through
acetyl-CoA or through
727.22 glucose going through the
glycolysis to pyruvate.
731.15 Then you have fatty acids,
which are able to create energy
737.51 through what's called beta
oxidation where, essentially,
739.91 you're taking these fatty
acids and you're lopping them
742.202 off two carbons at a time
to produce acetyl-CoA which,
745.04 again, can go into
the Krebs cycle,
747.112 produce those hydrogen
ions that can then
748.82 power the production of ATP.
750.96 So that's kind of like
at the cellular level
753.05 of how this stuff works.
754.77 But stepping back and
taking it back out,
757.97 what does that have to do with
weight loss or weight gain?
761.78 Well, when you think about
the balance of energy
766.11 in versus energy out.
767.31 Sounds very simple.
768.51 But let's look at
what actually makes up
770.4 energy in versus energy out.
772.56 First of all, you've
got to realize
774.81 that the energy
inside of the equation
777.36 is more difficult to
track than people think.
780.84 So one, food labels,
which we like
784.26 to think as being
from upon high,
788.79 can have up to a
20% error in them.
790.74 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really?
791.025 LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah.
791.85 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So a 100 calorie--
793.365 something listed as 100
calories per serving,
795.24 it could-- what's actually
in there could be 80 or 120.
797.677 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
798.51 Exactly.
799.41 So that's one aspect of it.
802.63 The second aspect is there's
what's called your energy,
805.48 but then there's also
metabolizable energy.
807.42 So if you have food stuff with
say, a lot of insoluble fiber,
810.66 typically, insoluble fiber
is not really digestible,
814.05 and so you could have "quite
a bit of carbohydrate," know
818.04 but if you can't extract
the energy from it--
821.88 and typically, this is
because insoluble fiber
823.95 from plant material, the
carbohydrate and even
828.27 some of the protein is bound up
in the plant structure, which
833.22 makes it inaccessible
to digestive enzymes.
835.83 And so this is what adds bulk
to your stool and whatnot.
839.05 But again, reduces the
metabolizable energy in there.
842.19 And there's some
evidence that based
844.2 on people's individual gut
microbiome, that some people
848.4 may actually be better at
extracting energy out of fiber
853.2 compared to other people.
854.82 So just starting
off right there,
857.73 OK, there's quite a bit of play
in the energy inside of things.
862.81 Now, one of the
things people will say
864.477 is, well, see that's
why you shouldn't worry
866.31 about tracking calories, because
the food levels can be 20% off.
869.52 And what I'll say is, OK.
873.337 I understand where
you're coming from.
874.92 But typically, if it's off, it's
going to be consistently off.
877.96 And if you're consistent
with how you track it,
880.14 eventually, you'll be able to
know what you're taking in.
884.31 And that's like saying, well,
don't worry about tracking
888.645 if you're--
889.29 I like to use
financial examples.
893.47 We know that to
save money, you have
896.26 to earn more money
than you spend.
898.36 Well, you can't exactly
know how much money
900.4 you're earning at a time
because there's inflation
902.98 and then there is--
904.03 if you have investments, those
can be different interest rates
908.02 and whatnot.
909.31 It's like, OK, if
you have a budget,
911.62 you have a reasonable idea
of what it's going to be.
914.26 And you make
certain assumptions,
915.73 but you can relatively guess.
917.56 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
917.71 That's a good example.
918.627 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
919.683 So now, let's look
at the energy outside
921.35 of the equation, which is
actually way more complicated.
923.96 And so your energy out is
a few different buckets.
929.07 The first one and
the biggest one
930.5 is your resting metabolic rate.
932.75 So your RMR.
934.56 And that, for most people,
is anywhere from 50% to 70%
937.92 of your total daily
energy expenditure.
940.48 Now, people use the term
metabolic rate and energy
943.44 expenditure interchangeably,
but they're not the same thing.
947.08 So your total daily
energy expenditure
948.96 is the summation of all the
energy you expend in a day.
953.497 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Walking upstairs,
955.35 exercise if you do it--
956.85 LAYNE NORTON: Fidgeting.
957.27 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
958.187 Plus your resting
metabolic rate.
959.76 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
960.03 So resting metabolic rate
is a big part of that,
962.17 but it's not the only thing.
963.99 So that's usually
about 50% to 70%.
966.36 And sedentary people will be
on the higher end of that.
969.64 So it'll be a bigger
proportion whereas people
971.58 who are more active, it'll
be a little bit lower, not
973.847 because their metabolic
rate is lower,
975.43 but because they're
expending a greater
977.055 percentage of their calories
from physical activity.
980.098 Then you have something
called the thermic effect
982.14 of food, which is a
relatively small percentage
984.96 of your total daily
energy expenditure.
986.73 It's about 5% to 10%.
988.98 And very difficult to
measure and usually
991.26 what researchers do when
they're looking at this stuff is
994.23 they just make an
assumption about it.
995.82 They use a constant.
997.46 But that's about 5% to 10% of
your daily energy expenditure.
999.96 And that refers to
the amount of energy
1002.36 it takes to extract
the energy out of food.
1005.63 So think about your
body like a car.
1009.26 You don't just have
gas in your tank
1010.76 and it spontaneously starts up.
1012.14 You have to have a battery
so you put in energy so you
1014.39 can get the energy
out of the petrol
1016.61 that you have in your car.
1018.37 Similar with food, you
can't just eat food
1022.39 and then it just
appears in your cells
1024.7 and you start doing stuff.
1026.26 It has to be
systematically broken
1028.27 down and put into forms that
can actually produce energy.
1032.5 And so you have to put some
energy in to achieve that.
1036.22 And a lot of times,
people will say something
1038.92 like, well, not all
calories are created equal.
1042.92 That's not true, because calorie
is just a unit of measurement.
1045.91 That would be like saying
not all seconds on a clock
1048.19 are created equal.
1049.21 Yes, they are.
1050.53 All sources of calories may have
differential effects on energy
1055.03 expenditure and appetite.
1056.08 So if we look at something
like fat, for example,
1060.41 the TEF of fat is
about 0% to 3%.
1062.83 Meaning, if you eat
100 calories from fat,
1065.05 your net will be
about 97 to 100.
1066.8 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So the
process of breaking down
1068.8 that fat, essentially,
subtracts some of the calories
1072.94 away because you used
it in creating energy--
1075.233 LAYNE NORTON: Correct.
1076.15 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --by
breaking those chemical bonds
1077.44 to create ATP.
1078.055 LAYNE NORTON: Correct.
1078.972 Correct.
1079.61 So you have like, for example,
some enzymes that require
1082.24 ATP to run these processes.
1084.02 Now, fat is actually the easiest
thing to convert into energy.
1087.285 Then you have
carbohydrate, which
1088.66 has a TEF of like 5% to 10%.
1090.95 So you eat 100 calories
from carbohydrate.
1092.95 And obviously, the fiber content
makes a big difference on this.
1096.58 But if you eat 100
calories, you'll net 92 95.
1099.85 Protein is about
a 20% to 30% TEF.
1103.54 So if you eat
calories from protein,
1105.04 you're only netting 70 to 80.
1107.05 Now, you're still net--
1108.7 people say, well, you
can't eat too much protein.
1111.28 Well, people will ask, well,
can protein be stored as fat?
1116.06 The carbon's from
protein it's unlikely,
1117.74 it's going to wind
up in adipose tissue.
1119.16 But if you're eating
a lot of protein,
1120.743 overall as part of a lot of
calories, it has to be oxidized
1123.668 and it can't provide a calorie
cushion for other things
1125.96 to be stored in fat.
1127.43 But protein itself does provide
a net positive for calories,
1132.53 but less so than
carbohydrate or fat.
1134.6 And tends to be more satiating.
1136.31 So again, when people talk about
are all calories created equal,
1139.85 yes, but all sources
of calories may
1141.62 have differential effects
on energy expenditure
1143.63 and appetite.
1145.01 So that's the TEF bucket
and the BMR bucket.
1147.98 Then we go to physical activity.
1149.63 And physical activity is,
essentially, two parts.
1151.92 There's exercise, which is kind
of your purposeful movements
1156.05 like you go out for a walk,
you do a training session.
1159.48 I mean, whatever.
1160.37 Any purposeful activity.
1163.02 And then you have
what's called NEAT
1164.67 which is non-exercise activity
thermogenesis, which I think
1167.76 is actually really cool.
1169.17 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It's fascinating.
1169.745 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
1170.31 It is.
1170.81 So I was actually hanging
out with somebody last night
1173.61 and I was noticing them,
they were fidgeting
1176.52 their feet and their fingers.
1178.83 And I said, have you
always been pretty lean?
1182.923 And they were like,
yeah, I never really
1184.59 had a problem
maintaining leanness.
1187.26 And when you look at the
obese resistant phenotype,
1190.62 people think they
have high BMR or they
1193.95 exercise a lot and really
what it seems to be as neat.
1197.25 They tend to-- if they
overeat, they just
1200.85 spontaneously increase
their physical activity.
1203.17 Now, people get NEAT confused.
1205.59 I've heard people say,
well, I'm going to go out
1207.59 for a walk to get my NEAT up.
1208.95 That's not NEAT.
1210.34 NEAT is not something you
can consciously modify.
1213.0 What you're doing there, if
it's purposeful, it's exercise.
1215.98 So for example,
when I'm talking,
1217.77 if I'm waving around my
hands, if I'm tapping my feet,
1220.26 if I'm--
1221.1 whatever.
1222.33 That's NEAT.
1224.01 But trying to get yourself--
1226.92 I'm just going to
tap my foot more,
1228.84 well, now if I'm
consciously having
1230.61 to do this, then my focus--
1232.02 I mean, you know
how the brain works.
1234.03 Very hard to do--
1235.2 you don't really do
two things at once.
1236.91 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
1237.09 LAYNE NORTON: You switch
quickly between tasks, right?
1239.05 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely.
1239.49 Can I quickly ask, was the
person that you were referring
1241.95 to our friend Ben Bruno?
1243.735 LAYNE NORTON: No, no.
1244.95 But he is fidgety too.
1246.015 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
1246.15 Amazing online fitness channel.
1248.07 He's a freakishly
strong individual.
1250.038 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
1250.83 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
1251.747 And I can't remember
whether or not,
1254.31 Ben, you're a fidgetter or not.
1255.66 But anyway, I'll
have to go check
1257.43 and we'll measure
your fidgeting.
1259.26 About non-exercise induced
thermogenesis NEAT,
1263.25 my understanding of the old
papers on this, old being,
1266.97 I guess, back to
the mid '90s, is
1268.92 that the calorie burn from NEAT
is actually pretty significant.
1272.303 We're not talking about 100
calories or 200 calories
1274.47 per day.
1275.01 We're talking about,
in some cases,
1277.21 hundreds of thousand-- excuse
me, hundreds to maybe even
1280.86 close to 1,000 calories per day.
1282.423 Could you elaborate on that?
1283.59 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
1284.382 So there was actually a really
classic study, I think, from--
1287.12 I want to say it's
from Levine in 1995.
1290.37 It was metabolic ward study.
1292.08 And hopefully, I don't
butcher the study
1294.48 because I'm trying to
pull it out of my brain.
1297.547 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I don't expect
you to have that in your head.
1300.13 Although, I must say, you have
a quite extensive PubMed ID,
1305.53 grab bag in there.
1306.68 So--
1307.18 LAYNE NORTON: I try
to bring the receipts.
1308.35 I try to bring the receipts.
1309.88 ANDREW HUBERMAN: We will put a
link to this study in the show
1311.59 note captions.
1312.25 So people can peruse it
if they like it, yeah.
1315.16 LAYNE NORTON: So I believe
they had people overeat.
1317.44 And I think it was by
like 1,000 calories a day
1319.91 and I think for six weeks.
1321.365 And I mean, this is
the metabolic ward.
1322.99 So this is very
tightly controlled.
1325.49 It's as tight as you get.
1327.01 And what was interesting
is, of course, on average,
1329.29 people gained weight
and gained fat mass.
1332.05 But some people gained
more than expected,
1336.1 and there was one person, in
particular, who only gained
1338.68 like just over 1/2 a kilo.
1341.62 They should have gained like--
1343.51 I think it was something
like 3 to 4 kilos.
1345.34 It was predicted.
1346.66 And what they found
is this individual
1349.12 just spontaneously increased
their physical activity.
1353.44 He didn't purposefully
do it, it just happened.
1356.2 And I mean,
anecdotally, I've seen
1359.83 people who are, again,
very lean even eat a meal,
1364.51 sit down, and start sweating.
1366.87 And be very fidgety.
1368.222 There was a natural
bodybuilder back in the day
1370.18 named Jim Cordova.
1371.44 And this guy was just
very lean all the time,
1375.16 and he was exactly
that phenotype.
1377.98 He would walk up
a flight of stairs
1379.503 and all of a sudden
he's sweating.
1380.92 Sit down eat a
meal, he's sweating.
1382.855 He's just--
1383.47 ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's a furnace.
1384.803 LAYNE NORTON: Just
expending energy.
1387.76 And what's very
interesting about NEAT
1389.89 is that seems to be
the most modifiable--
1393.04 I mean, exercise
is very modifiable
1394.84 because you can be
intentional with that.
1396.86 But of BMR, TEF,
and NEAT, NEAT seems
1401.14 to be far more modifiable.
1402.61 So even a bodyweight
reduction of 10%,
1408.17 they've observed
a decrease in NEAT
1411.05 of almost 500 calories a day for
a 10% reduction in body weight.
1416.82 Now, you also do
get a decline in BMR
1419.3 when you lose weight,
one, because you're just
1421.88 in a smaller body now and
so it takes less energy
1424.46 to lock them out.
1426.71 But also there's what's called
metabolic adaptation, which
1429.68 is a further reduction
in your BMR than expected
1434.18 from the loss of body mass.
1435.59 And that's on average
usually around like 15%.
1439.16 But it does seem to be--
1441.62 there's new evidence coming
out on the metabolic adaptation
1444.29 from BMR.
1445.52 And it seems to
be a little bit--
1448.19 kind of in the
transition phases.
1450.38 So if you start a diet
within the first few weeks,
1454.28 you will have a reduction
in BMR that then just--
1460.34 thereafter, any
further reduction
1462.74 is mostly from the amount
of body mass you lose.
1465.74 And then if you, like for
example, finish a diet
1468.77 and move your calories
to maintenance,
1471.86 within a few weeks, BMR
starts to come back up.
1475.58 There is still a
small reduction,
1477.89 but I used to be
somebody who thought
1479.96 that BMR, metabolic
adaptation was
1482.57 a big reason why people stopped
losing weight or plateaued.
1486.11 And now, I think it's
much more to do with NEAT.
1488.292 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
1489.5 And you said that it
can't be conscious
1492.89 because that will distract
us from other activities.
1495.183 I don't know if you've had a
chance to look at this study.
1497.6 And I'll send it to you.
1498.32 Maybe I'd be fun to do a kind
of an online journal club
1500.63 about this at some point soon.
1501.75 But there's a study that came
out of University of Houston
1504.167 recently having people do, now,
this is a long period of time.
1507.8 Four hours a day of, basically,
a soleus pushup, which
1510.785 is basically a heel raise.
1511.97 A seated catchphrase with
one foot not weighted.
1514.273 And then they
looked at it a bunch
1515.69 of things about glucose
metabolism and glucose
1519.08 clearance and insulin levels.
1520.46 And they didn't
conclude that people
1522.77 burned a ton of
calories, but what
1524.24 they concluded was that blood
sugar regulation improved
1527.99 greatly.
1528.56 And I think, there was
a lot of excitement
1531.29 about this at some
level, but based
1534.98 on everything you're telling
me, this fits perfectly
1537.38 with what's known about neat.
1538.68 So this fell somewhere
in between with--
1541.07 in between, excuse me,
sort of deliberate exercise
1544.25 and spontaneous movement.
1545.378 I guess they've tried to make
that spontaneous movement
1547.67 a little bit more conscious.
1548.75 LAYNE NORTON: Well,
what I'll tell
1550.04 people is if you're
worried about NEAT,
1551.75 one thing you can do,
like these watches,
1554.807 for example where people
are like, oh, well,
1556.64 told me I burned
these many calories.
1558.74 They are not accurate
for energy expenditure.
1561.5 I mean, it is like, there
was a meta analysis in 2018,
1566.36 I want to say,
between a 28% and 93%
1572.69 overestimation of energy
expenditure by these watches.
1575.09 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fitness track.
1575.69 So for those of you
listening, we're
1576.86 not going to name the brand.
1578.027 But fitness trackers-- so
wrist-worn fitness trackers.
1580.8 LAYNE NORTON: And this
is across the board.
1582.592 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
1583.23 LAYNE NORTON: So like
depending on the brand,
1584.63 it could be more or
less but, they all
1586.55 overestimated the amount of--
1588.44 the calories you
burn from exercise.
1590.25 So this is actually a great
example where people go, well,
1592.88 calories in, calories
out doesn't work for me,
1594.797 because I eat in a calorie
deficit, I didn't lose weight.
1597.26 When I talk to
them, usually, they
1599.9 went to an online calculator.
1601.79 It's a few things.
1602.54 They went to an
online calculator, put
1604.55 in their information, it spat
out some calories to eat,
1607.522 and they ate that and
didn't lose weight.
1609.23 And it's like, well, what
do you think is more likely?
1611.48 That you're defying the laws
of conservation of energy
1614.9 or that you might
have not gotten
1617.78 the right number for you?
1618.923 ANDREW HUBERMAN: The
measurement tool was off.
1620.84 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
1621.632 The next thing is a lot of
people weigh very sporadically.
1625.01 And I'll tell people
like, if you're
1626.51 going to make an intentional
weight loss a goal,
1629.75 and again, this can be
different for different people,
1632.0 but typically, I
tell people, weigh
1634.13 in, first thing in the
morning or after you
1636.05 go to the bathroom,
do it every day,
1637.64 and take the average
of that for the week.
1639.59 And then compare that to
the next week's average.
1641.9 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can I ask
one-- sorry to interrupt,
1643.49 but one quick question
about that when you say,
1645.448 go to the bathroom not
to get too detailed here
1649.58 unnecessarily, but are you
talking about urination
1651.8 and emptying your bowels?
1653.34 Ideally, because you did eat
a big meal the night before.
1655.715 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
1656.24 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
1656.57 Got it.
1656.93 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
1657.722 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So wake up,
use the bathroom in all forms
1662.15 that you're ready, and
then get on the scale,
1665.57 take that measurement, average
that across the week, and then
1669.26 maybe every Monday,
you take that value
1670.907 and see how it progresses.
1671.99 LAYNE NORTON: All right.
1672.99 And the reason I recommend
doing that is, if you're just
1676.28 sporadically weighing in, as
somebody who weighs themselves
1679.85 pretty regularly,
I mean, my weight
1681.86 will fluctuate 5, 6 pounds, and
not seemingly changing much.
1687.05 And that's just-- those
short term changes are fluid.
1690.35 So I've had it before,
where week to week,
1693.89 my average didn't change.
1695.06 But between the lowest weigh
in from a previous week
1698.15 and the highest weigh in, might
have been like 8 pounds, right?
1702.68 So if you're somebody who
just randomly is weighing in
1706.58 and you're eating in
a calorie deficit,
1709.1 and you just weigh in
one day where you've just
1711.83 whatever reason holding some
more fluid, then you're oh,
1714.62 see, this isn't working when
in reality, your average
1717.2 might be dropping.
1718.38 So that's one of the
reasons, and actually,
1720.83 believe it or not,
weight fluctuations
1722.96 are actually identified as a
major reason why people get
1725.63 discouraged from weight loss.
1728.37 It stops the buy-in, when
they have a fluctuation up.
1731.43 So that's one of the reasons--
1732.68 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great point.
1733.19 LAYNE NORTON: --one
of the reasons early
1734.21 on that low carb diets
tend to work really
1735.95 well is because people
lose a lot of water weight
1737.992 really quickly, and
they get that buy-in.
1739.82 So they're, oh, this is working.
1741.41 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
1741.62 We can return to
that in a little bit
1743.162 because I have theories
as to how that--
1746.305 when people eat
less carbohydrate,
1747.74 they excrete more
water, and they'll see--
1750.11 for the first time, they'll see
some definition in their abs,
1752.75 oh, my God, this diet's amazing.
1753.875 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
1754.667 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And the fluid
loss does hold that promise.
1757.44 I think fluid loss can
do some other things.
1759.273 It might make people
literally feel lighter,
1761.807 although it can be-- it
has some negative effects.
1763.89 I do have one quick
question, and I
1765.895 do want-- we will return
to NEAT in a moment.
1767.77 But when you say,
the caloric burn
1769.95 as a consequence
of exercise, I want
1772.14 to ask about the caloric
burn during that exercise?
1775.36 So for instance, if
somebody is on the treadmill
1777.48 and they'll see, OK,
they burn 400 calories.
1779.465 Actually, I think
this is a month
1780.84 where a number of
prominent podcasters
1782.49 like Bert Kreischer, Tom
Segura, Joe Rogan, and others,
1784.92 I think they call
it "Sober October,"
1786.462 but in addition to
avoiding alcohol,
1788.07 they're burning 500 calories
per day during the exercise.
1790.59 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
1790.83 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
They're measuring it.
1792.15 A lot of people do this.
1793.24 They think-- they take
track of weather--
1795.75 excuse me, take stock of how
many calories they burned.
1799.05 My understanding is that if
that particular form of exercise
1802.65 is a muscle building
form of exercise,
1805.32 that at some point later, there
might be an increase in muscle
1809.79 if you did everything
right, do everything right,
1812.04 and then you will
burn more energy
1813.69 as a consequence of
adding that tissue.
1815.49 That's a long process
as and we will discuss.
1818.88 But I have heard about this
post-exercise induced increase
1823.26 in oxidative metabolism.
1825.0 I'm probably not using the
right language in here.
1827.5 So if I were to go out, for
instance, and do some sprints.
1830.55 Run hard for a minute, jog for
a minute, run hard for a minute,
1833.19 and do that 10 times over.
1836.39 Let's assume I burn 400 calories
during that exercise bout.
1841.73 But my understanding is that
in the hours that follow,
1844.79 my basal metabolic rate
will have increased.
1847.16 Is that true, and is
it significant enough
1849.41 to care about?
1850.085 LAYNE NORTON: So answer
both of those questions.
1853.49 Yes, there does seem
to be a small increase
1856.58 in metabolic rate,
and no, it does not
1859.13 appear to be enough to
actually make a difference.
1861.42 So when they look at--
1862.7 and again, this is
where I tell people--
1866.63 I think I have a good
perspective on this,
1868.76 because my undergraduate degree
was a biochemistry degree.
1871.56 So I was very into mechanisms.
1872.925 You know what I mean?
1873.8 It was like, oh, if we just do
this and this, we'll get this.
1877.43 And then I did nutrition
as a graduate degree,
1879.92 and then my advisor was so great
because you could do something
1883.165 over here and he could tell
you how it would affect
1885.29 vitamin D metabolism over here.
1886.7 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
This is Don Lemon?
1887.45 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah, Don Lemon.
1888.7 So he would always
kind of say, yeah,
1892.19 but what's the outcome
going to be, right?
1894.17 So this is actually one of the
things I changed my mind on.
1897.385 Was I used to be
very much, well,
1898.76 I think high intensity interval
training is probably better
1901.88 because you get this
post-exercise energy burn
1904.16 which they do see in
some of these studies.
1906.9 But in the meta analyzes and
more tightly controlled studies
1912.2 where they equate work between
high intensity intervals
1915.17 and moderate or low intensity
cardio, so equating work,
1920.0 they don't see differences
in the loss of body fat.
1922.4 And so to me, if I'm
looking like, that's
1925.28 the example of a
mechanism, which is OK,
1928.28 we're seeing this small increase
in basal metabolic rate,
1931.83 that should lead to
increased loss of body fat.
1935.31 But again, remember, you're
capturing a snapshot in time.
1939.68 But we don't see a difference
in the loss of body fat.
1942.21 So what may be happening-- and
again, I'm just speculating.
1944.96 But a way to explain it could
be, you might have an increase
1948.5 and then you might actually
have a decrease that tends
1951.8 to just wash it out, right?
1952.94 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I see.
1953.898 And I have to imagine
some forms of exercise.
1956.6 This would be highly individual,
but will spike appetite more
1960.29 than others.
1960.96 So for instance, if I go out
for a 45-minute jog which I do.
1964.49 A 45 to 60-minute hike or
jog once a week, I just
1967.213 make it a point to do that or
ruck or something like that.
1969.63 Throw on a weight vest and hike.
1971.21 After that, I find I'm very
thirsty, I want to hydrate.
1974.9 But I'm not that hungry.
1976.67 And that's true of all
cardiovascular exercise for me.
1980.73 But after I weight train,
about 60 to 90 minutes later,
1986.08 I want to eat the refrigerator.
1988.09 And so obviously,
calories in, calories out
1991.15 dictates that that will
play an important role as to
1994.06 whether or not I gain or
lose weight, et cetera.
1996.1 So is it safe to say that
the specific form of exercise
1999.22 that people choose needs to
be taken in consideration?
2004.687 Calories in, calories
out, so how much
2006.27 is burned during the exercise?
2007.74 Also how much that exercise
tends to stimulate appetite.
2010.64 I don't know whether
or not people explore
2012.39 this in their rigorous studies.
2014.01 And whether or not
that form of exercise
2016.59 actually increases lean
muscle mass or not.
2021.42 Now, we've taken
exercise and split it
2023.22 into a number of
different dimensions,
2024.803 but this is what you are
so masterful at is really
2027.75 parsing how the different
components work individually
2030.24 and together.
2031.09 So if you would
just expand on that,
2033.78 I'd love to know
what you're thinking.
2035.49 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
2036.282 So this is actually a
really fascinating thing.
2038.58 So first thing, I
want to just go back
2040.62 to talking about like, for
example, Bert and Tom and Joe,
2044.22 we're going to do 500
calories a day on whatever.
2047.07 So those apparatuses
don't measure those things
2049.53 effectively either.
2050.639 Just like these watches.
2052.06 But the one thing I will
say is, if you are--
2055.98 like for example, if I do two
hours of resistance training,
2058.98 typically, this will say I
burned about 1,000 calories.
2061.44 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a
lot of resistance training.
2063.239 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
2063.69 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
My weight workouts
2065.148 are warm up for 10 minutes and
then one hour of work done.
2067.992 LAYNE NORTON: I just--
2068.909 I love to train.
2069.576 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
2070.48 And you can recover from.
2071.639 My recovery quotient
is pretty low.
2073.719 So I've been training
for 30 plus years,
2076.53 and I found that if I
do more than an hour
2079.92 of hard work in the gym,
meaning resistance training,
2084.449 75 minutes maybe, I'm OK, but
past that, I have to take two,
2088.395 maybe even three days
off before I can train.
2090.27 My nervous system just
doesn't tolerate it well.
2092.55 So I limit it to
an hour, you know.
2095.135 LAYNE NORTON: And part of
that to remember is like,
2097.26 I've built up to that over
a long period of time.
2099.58 So you couldn't just throw
somebody in and start
2101.58 having them do two hours a day.
2102.48 It's not going to
go well for them.
2103.89 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like
to take a quick break,
2105.89 and acknowledge one of our
sponsors, Athletic Greens.
2108.72 Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
is a vitamin mineral probiotic
2113.04 drink that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.
2116.4 I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,
2119.16 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
2121.44 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens,
2123.273 and the reason I still
take athletic Greens, once
2125.52 or usually twice a day, is
that it gets me the probiotics
2129.03 that I need for gut health.
2130.68 Our gut is very
important, it's populated
2132.48 by gut microbiota
that communicate
2134.83 with the brain, the immune
system, and basically
2136.83 all the biological
systems of our body
2138.54 to strongly impact our
immediate and long term health.
2142.08 And those probiotics
and Athletic Greens
2144.03 are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health.
2147.783 In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number
2149.7 of adaptogens,
vitamins, and minerals
2151.32 that make sure that all of my
foundational or nutritional
2153.72 needs are met.
2154.59 And it tastes great.
2156.588 If you'd like to
try Athletic Greens,
2158.13 you can go to
athleticgreens.com.huberman,
2161.31 and they'll give
you five free travel
2163.14 packs that make it
really easy to mix up
2164.85 Athletic Greens while you're
on the road, in the car,
2167.1 on the plane, et cetera.
2168.21 And they'll give you a year's
supply of vitamin D3, K2.
2171.81 Again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman
2174.39 to get the five free travel
packs and the year's supply
2176.97 of vitamin D3, K2.
2178.29 LAYNE NORTON: But I will say
about the calorie trackers, so
2180.81 if I'm used to--
2181.8 OK, I usually burn about 1,000
calories according to this,
2185.79 it's not accurate.
2187.14 But if I go in tomorrow and I do
1,300, it may not be accurate--
2192.997 I don't know what
the exact number is,
2194.58 but I can be relatively
confident that it's
2196.38 more than the previous session.
2198.48 And so in terms
of comparison, it
2200.25 might be OK, like
within subject.
2203.64 And then the other thing I
was kind of circling around on
2206.16 was, if you're worried about
NEAT, tracking your steps
2208.77 can be helpful because people
step counts can spontaneously
2211.56 decrease when they're
on a fat loss diet,
2213.268 they don't even realize it.
2215.25 And that, again, not
a complete measure
2217.29 of NEAT, but what we've had
some clients do with our team
2221.13 building coaches is, they'll
say OK, you're, at 8,000 steps
2224.94 right now.
2226.02 We're not going to add
any purposeful cardio.
2228.45 But whatever you need to do
to maintain that 8,000 steps,
2233.22 do that.
2233.88 And sometimes, they have to add
15, 20, 30 minutes of cardio,
2238.122 because they're spontaneous
activity that they're not
2240.33 even aware of goes down.
2241.47 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's
a really excellent point.
2244.2 I've heard the 10,000
steps per day number was,
2247.77 we all heard that.
2248.79 And then I learned that, 10,000
were just kind of thrown out
2251.64 as an arbitrary number.
2252.907 So we're like get eight-hour
intermittent fasting thing,
2255.24 there's a story behind
that because actually I
2257.483 spoke to Satchin,
and it turns out
2258.9 that the graduate
student in his lab
2260.76 did that initial study, which
was on mice, by the way,
2263.83 was limited to being in
lab for about eight hours
2266.91 by their significant other.
2268.08 So the eight-hour feeding window
is actually the consequence
2270.69 of this person's relationship.
2273.1 So--
2273.6 LAYNE NORTON: That is
a really great point
2274.92 that people don't realize
when they-- a lot of people
2277.26 will try to copy like
scientific studies.
2279.84 And I'll tell people like,
listen, scientific studies are
2283.95 so confined.
2286.77 You need to be very careful
with how broadly you
2289.02 apply what's in there.
2290.31 Like they're a very big hammer
is the way I look at it.
2294.33 They're not a scalpel,
they're a big hammer.
2296.28 And I think, a lot of
times in terms of coaching,
2299.49 scientific studies will
tell you what not to do
2301.92 rather than what to do, right?
2304.295 But getting back
to your question
2305.67 about exercise,
appetite, so first off,
2308.79 I'm not really aware if
there's evidence showing
2312.06 like differential effects of
different forms of exercise
2315.33 on appetite, it's possible,
but again, it also
2319.95 could be like a
placebo effect, right?
2321.87 Because we-- like for example,
you and I, grew up in an era
2325.26 where the muscle
magazines, it was like,
2326.927 well, as soon as you
finish your workout,
2328.635 you have your biggest
meal of the day.
2330.24 And when I say placebo
effect, I think
2334.71 people have the wrong idea of
what the placebo effect is.
2337.35 They think that's
just a feeling.
2339.6 Placebo effect can actually
change your physiology.
2342.63 People don't realize this.
2344.77 There's research showing
that a placebo or the power
2347.43 of suggestion is
basically as powerful
2350.19 as some pharmaceuticals.
2351.75 And one of the great examples
I like to use is-- actually,
2354.907 there was a study we just
covered in our research review
2357.24 on creatine where
they did four groups--
2362.027 not supplemented with creatine,
told they weren't supplemented
2364.61 with creatine, not
supplemented, told
2366.98 they were supplemented,
supplemented,
2368.66 told they weren't,
supplemented, until they were.
2372.26 Basically, it just matters
what they told them.
2374.39 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really.
2374.735 LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah.
2375.44 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
This is incredible.
2377.19 I have to get this
study well so we
2378.86 can link to a colleague
of mine at Stanford.
2381.417 She's been on the podcast.
2382.5 I'd love to introduce
you to because I
2384.083 think you guys really riff.
2385.36 First of all, she was
a former D1 athlete
2387.98 and then as runs a lab at
Stanford in psychology.
2390.8 This is Alia Crum.
2392.48 And she's-- and grew up in
this very athletic, obviously,
2397.4 and very, very smart.
2398.73 And her laboratory focuses on
these belief/placebo effects
2401.99 where if you tell people all
the horrible things that stress
2404.51 do to you in terms of
your memory and cognitive
2406.55 functioning and then you
give them a memory test,
2408.665 they perform well
below baseline.
2410.68 If you tell them that
stress sharpens them
2412.43 in the short term,
and that adrenaline
2414.14 is this powerful
molecule that can really
2416.84 tune up a number of memory
systems, memory improves.
2419.63 And it's remarkable.
2422.03 And it's consistent.
2424.035 And they've done this for any
number of different things,
2426.41 including food
allergies, for instance.
2428.92 Incredible results.
2430.25 In any case, I'm so glad
you're bringing this up.
2434.42 I take creatine monohydrate,
and I have for years.
2437.42 5 grams a day.
2438.27 I don't--
2438.77 LAYNE NORTON: And it's great.
2439.86 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it's great.
2441.193 And I believe it's great.
2442.61 So is there a compound effect
of believing it's great
2445.37 and it actually being great?
2447.247 LAYNE NORTON: Not in this study.
2448.58 So I think the
thing to point out,
2450.32 people will misinterpret that
as creatine doesn't work.
2453.57 And that's not what that says.
2454.82 What it says is, your
beliefs about what it does
2458.12 are probably just as
powerful as what it does.
2461.69 So they actually did a study--
2464.12 and I don't have the
citation, but it was--
2466.4 I think, within
the last 10 years
2467.96 where they told people
they were putting them
2469.835 on anabolic steroids.
2470.72 And wouldn't you know it,
they had better gains--
2472.958 even though they weren't
actually on anabolic steroids,
2475.25 they had better gains than
people that they didn't tell
2477.26 were anabolic steroids.
2478.025 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing.
2478.31 LAYNE NORTON: And that's
like hard outcomes.
2480.143 Strength, lean body mass,
those sorts of things.
2482.85 So when people say,
well, I wouldn't
2484.94 fall for the placebo
effect, it's like,
2487.7 you don't have to fall for it.
2489.8 If you believe it to be
true, the power of belief
2493.46 is very, very powerful.
2496.11 And as a scientist, I wish,
sometimes, I was ignorant
2498.943 so that I could subject
myself to the placebo effect
2501.11 more often.
2501.76 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, absolutely.
2503.177 LAYNE NORTON: So
getting back to,
2505.31 that's just a possible
explanation of, maybe, why.
2508.37 And I'm the same way, like
I get done with a workout,
2510.98 like a resistance training
session, I'm like,
2512.855 I'm ready to eat.
2514.34 Now, if you look
at the literature
2516.77 overall on exercise
and appetite,
2518.69 it's not always
what you'd expect.
2522.5 Consistently, it seems to show
that exercise actually has
2525.98 an appetite suppressant effect.
2527.7 So people don't
tend to compensate
2531.2 at least fully for the
amount of movement they do.
2534.92 And there is some
evidence that--
2538.29 you've probably heard
people say, well, exercise
2540.29 a really poor weight loss tool.
2542.57 If you figure out
how many calories
2544.85 you should be burning
from it and you do that,
2547.17 you end up getting less weight
loss that you would predict.
2550.018 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have
a family member who
2551.81 is perfectly happy to eat less,
but doesn't loathe exercise,
2555.8 but dislikes exercise.
2558.29 And they're of healthy weight.
2560.42 But I'm always encouraging
them to exercise more.
2563.04 And so this is an ongoing battle
in our sibling relationship.
2566.032 LAYNE NORTON: Well,
one thing I would say
2567.74 is that, exercise
independent of anything
2570.373 that happens with your body
weight, you will be healthier.
2572.79 So exercise is one of the
only things that will actually
2575.6 improve your
biomarkers of health
2577.61 without even losing weight.
2579.11 So those-- it will improve
your insulin sensitivity,
2581.87 inflammation, all that stuff.
2583.65 So everybody out there looking
for a hack to be healthier
2587.36 exercises the hack, right?
2588.71 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
2588.94 Crucial point.
2589.523 And our mutual friend
Dr. Peter Attia, I think,
2594.23 has gone on record
several times now saying
2596.36 that of all the things
that one could take--
2599.12 NMN, et cetera, metformin.
2601.84 Regardless of whether or not
one takes those or doesn't take
2604.34 those, that the positive
effects on longevity
2607.64 by way of biomarkers from
regular exercise is--
2612.59 far outweighs all of
those things combined.
2615.38 Not that those things
don't necessarily work,
2617.398 we're not going through
them in detail now,
2619.19 but that exercise
is by far the best
2622.13 thing we can do for our
health span and lifespan.
2624.295 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
2624.71 Absolutely.
2625.34 I 100% agree.
2627.27 And when you're talking
about weight loss,
2629.72 people miss the point
of exercise, I think.
2632.215 There's some work that came
out from Herman Pontzer
2634.34 as well that basically
showed like, well,
2636.78 if you do 100 calories
from exercise,
2638.96 you have a 28-calorie reduction
in your basal metabolic rate
2643.85 in response to that.
2644.76 So it's kind of like this
constrained energy expenditure
2647.69 model.
2648.71 But what I would say is, OK,
well there's still a net of 72.
2651.41 So it's still OK,
and the other thing
2654.98 is, I think the effects
of exercise on weight loss
2658.13 are actually more due to
what it does to appetite.
2661.46 So if you look at people who
lose weight and keep it off
2665.03 for a number of years,
kind of outliers
2667.34 because most people don't keep
it off for years, over 70%
2671.67 of them engage in
regular exercise.
2673.59 Of people who do not
keep weight loss,
2675.42 like maintain weight loss, less
than 30% exercise regularly.
2679.56 So now that's just
a correlation.
2681.21 That doesn't necessarily
prove causation.
2683.16 But there are some
pretty compelling studies
2686.79 showing that exercise
increases your sensitivity
2689.55 to satiety signals.
2691.11 So basically, you can have
the same satiety signals,
2693.51 but you're more sensitive
to them when you exercise.
2696.57 And there's actually
a really classic study
2698.91 from the 1950s in
Bengali workers
2701.79 where they looked at, basically,
four different quadrants
2706.85 of activity.
2707.76 So you had sedentary, lightly
active, moderately active,
2711.68 heavily active.
2713.24 Basically, based on
their job choice.
2715.95 And they didn't have
an intervention.
2718.35 They just wanted to track
them and see how many calories
2721.59 did they actually eat.
2722.91 So it was like a J-shaped curve.
2725.17 So the sedentary
actually ate more food
2728.49 than the lightly active
or moderately active.
2731.62 But from lightly active
to heavily active,
2734.59 they almost perfectly
compensated how many calories
2737.71 they should be eating.
2739.21 So to me, that suggests,
when you become active,
2742.52 you can actually regulate your
appetite appropriately or much
2745.667 more appropriately than
if you're sedentary.
2747.5 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And do you think
2748.875 this has to do with
changes in the brain--
2750.7 brain centers that
respond to satiety signals
2752.83 from the periphery,
and/or do you
2757.03 think it has to do with changes
in blood sugar regulation?
2760.533 What I was taught, and I
don't know if this is still
2762.7 considered true, is that
spikes in blood sugar
2765.01 will trigger a desire to
eat more even though it's
2767.14 kind of exactly the opposite
of what you need when you
2769.39 have a spike in blood sugar.
2770.71 And there's this
kind of-- and we'll
2771.76 get into this when we talk
about artificial sweeteners.
2774.052 This is the idea in mind.
2775.16 I think I adopted, perhaps,
falsely that you eat something
2778.87 that's sweeter, that
tastes really good,
2780.55 and you are suddenly on the
train of wanting to eat more.
2783.97 And I could imagine
how exercise,
2786.49 if it is increasing
the satiety signals,
2789.85 could be working a
number of different ways.
2792.088 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
2792.88 I think it's--
2794.17 I think the effect is probably
mostly at the brain level.
2798.25 The effects on blood sugar--
2803.56 the research out there is not
very compelling for blood sugar
2807.3 driving appetite.
2809.07 Now, if you become hypoglycemic,
yes, you'll get hungry,
2812.88 but it's a different kind of
hunger than your normal like,
2816.0 I feel kind of empty and
my stomach's growling.
2818.49 Like those are--
they can go together,
2820.62 but usually like the
hypoglycemia is like, I am hot,
2824.11 I feel like I'm
going to pass out.
2825.81 You want to eat something not
because your stomach's growling
2828.75 but because that you
just need some fuel.
2830.493 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's like
you're getting pulled under.
2832.785 LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah.
2833.747 Absolutely.
2834.215 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I've been there when
2835.757 I've done the longer
fasts, something
2837.33 I don't do anymore and
drink a lot of black coffee.
2840.093 There was probably an
electrolyte effect there
2842.01 because coffee as you excrete
sodium and other electrolytes.
2845.46 And then just feeling
like, I needed something.
2847.807 This whole thing
like I need something
2849.39 that's kind of desperation.
2850.995 I never want to be
back here again.
2853.452 Hypoglycemia is
very uncomfortable.
2854.91 LAYNE NORTON: It's not fun.
2856.035 So again, then when they look
at actual randomized controlled
2863.43 trials of implementing
some exercise where
2867.54 they're pretty
controlled environment,
2871.06 they typically see people--
2873.085 if anything, they eat less
as opposed to eating more.
2876.46 Now, some people, again,
studies report averages.
2879.88 And there's individual
data points.
2881.45 So there are some people who
at least anecdotally report
2883.96 that exercise makes
them more hungry.
2886.03 That's completely valid.
2887.98 It could be their
beliefs around it,
2889.842 it could be a number
of different things,
2891.55 but it's important to
understand that there
2893.342 is individual variability.
2894.5 And I think one of
the things that I've
2897.04 learned to appreciate
more is not
2900.41 trying to separate
psychology and physiology.
2903.887 We do this a lot and say, well,
I want to know the physiology,
2906.47 I don't care about
the psychology of it.
2908.137 And now I'm kind of appreciating
more, psychology is physiology.
2912.83 Like with most things
now, we have kind
2914.51 of the biopsychosocial model.
2917.078 And I'll give you
an example of this.
2918.62 A lot of people get really
caught up with appetite.
2922.58 And if we could just
suppress people's appetite,
2926.77 that's part of it.
2928.69 But people don't just eat
because they're hungry,
2931.78 they eat for a lot of different
reasons, social reasons,
2935.0 especially.
2935.727 So can you remember the
last social event you ever
2937.81 went to that didn't have food?
2938.755 ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
2939.588 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
2940.72 If you look at dinner
plates from the 1800s,
2943.0 they're about this big.
2944.255 Now how big are dinner plates?
2945.505 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
The whole buffet.
2946.937 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
2947.77 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
2950.11 LAYNE NORTON: There's
situational cues.
2952.75 You're sitting down to watch TV.
2954.16 Oh, grab some popcorn,
grab some snack, whatever.
2956.255 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
even see this with--
2957.88 you know, how one person
will pick up the phone
2959.68 and then everyone
picks up their phone.
2960.98 I think there's a
similar effect with food.
2962.68 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
2963.55 And same thing, right?
2964.57 Like how many times have
we either done it ourselves
2969.53 or have been experienced
people saying, oh, you
2972.47 should have something--
you should have alcohol,
2975.17 especially, right?
2975.92 People-- I was hanging out
with somebody last night
2979.64 and I had a beer and
they just had a water.
2983.48 And I'm like, I feel no need
to try and convince them
2987.53 to do that with me.
2988.55 You know what I mean?
2989.48 But as humans,
we're hurt animals.
2994.61 We don't want to be
doing something out
2996.38 in isolation on our own.
2997.53 Now, this is a very tenuous,
I guess, belief of mine.
3002.03 But doing things
alone in isolation
3007.34 during ancestral
times, that's going
3012.57 to set off your alarm system.
3014.095 Because if you don't
have other people,
3015.72 you can't protect yourself.
3017.67 So typically, things were
done together in groups.
3021.0 And I think that's a
lot of the reason why
3023.01 we tend to be just tribal in
nature about a lot of things.
3027.78 So the whole point to that
is, on the list of reasons
3032.04 why people eat, I
mean, I've gotten
3033.782 to the point where I think that
hunger is actually not even
3036.24 the main reason people eat.
3037.71 Stress, lack of sleep--
3040.268 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Boredom.
3041.31 LAYNE NORTON: --boredom.
3041.94 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
3042.57 LAYNE NORTON: Absolutely.
3043.72 So unless we can
do something that
3046.5 addresses all those
things, there's
3050.22 a line from a review paper--
3051.99 this review paper
came out in 2011
3053.505 is by a researcher
named MacLean.
3055.17 And it's the best review
paper I've ever read.
3058.23 It was called, biology's
response to dieting--
3060.97 the impetus for weight regain.
3062.37 And basically went
through all the mechanisms
3064.47 of these adaptations that
happen during fat loss diets
3067.71 and how biology's response
is to try to drive you back
3071.58 to your previous.
3073.59 And I'm going to
butcher the quote,
3075.06 but at the end of the
study he said, basically,
3078.39 the body's systems are
comprehensive, redundant,
3083.91 and well-focused on restoring
depleted energy reserves.
3087.12 And any attempt or any
strategy for weight loss
3094.19 that doesn't attempt to
address a broad spectrum
3098.84 of these things
is going to fail.
3101.31 And so that's why when people
say, well, just do low carb,
3104.84 you won't be hungry.
3106.3 Look, people don't just
eat because they're hungry.
3109.22 So I think really like
trying to get outside the box
3113.3 and think about these things.
3114.65 And especially, when you
read some of the literature,
3117.08 I recently read a systematic
review of successful weight
3120.65 loss maintainers, which I
thought was really interesting.
3123.988 So they took people who had lost
a significant amount of body
3126.53 weight and kept it off for,
I think, it was three years.
3129.222 And it basically asked
them questions and tried
3131.18 to identify commonalities.
3132.295 And there were
some things that I
3133.67 expected like cognitive
restraint, self monitoring,
3138.44 exercise.
3140.78 And then one of the
things they said
3142.28 that I found really fascinating
was pretty ubiquitous
3145.64 between people.
3146.3 They said, I had to
develop a new identity.
3150.52 So are you familiar
with Ethan Suplee?
3152.647 ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
3153.48 LAYNE NORTON: So
Ethan is an actor.
3155.71 He's been in like remember the
Titans and American History X.
3158.933 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I certainly
saw American History X.
3161.1 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
3161.892 So he was very large.
3163.56 He was like 550 pounds.
3165.15 And now he's like
230 and jacked.
3167.547 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
5-- he was how many--
3169.38 LAYNE NORTON: 550 pounds.
3170.5 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
3172.29 LAYNE NORTON: And he
has-- whenever he puts up
3175.35 post on his Instagram of
him training, it'll say,
3178.95 I killed my clone today.
3180.9 And I asked him, is this
what you're talking about?
3185.595 Creating a new identity.
3186.803 And he said, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.
3188.97 Because I had to kill who I was.
3190.92 Because there was
no way I was going
3192.66 to be able to make long
term changes if I just
3195.75 didn't become a new person.
3197.52 Because I mean, and
addicts talk about this.
3200.22 Like people who are alcoholics.
3202.29 They had to get new friends.
3203.672 They had to hang out
at different places,
3205.38 because their entire
life had been set up
3207.9 around this lifestyle
for alcohol.
3210.12 And I would actually argue
that eating disorders
3214.53 or disordered eating patterns
is much harder to break
3219.54 than other forms of addiction.
3221.13 And you think about
food addiction.
3223.33 Well, in some ways, bulimia and
anorexia are still addictions.
3231.03 You can't stop eating.
3232.758 Like if you're alcoholic,
you can abstain from alcohol.
3235.05 If you become addicted
to say, cocaine,
3236.88 you can abstain from that.
3239.48 You can never abstain from food.
3241.29 And so now imagine
telling a gambling addict,
3244.4 well, you've got to play this
slot a couple of times a day
3248.33 but no more.
3249.5 Like that's really challenging.
3252.57 So yeah.
3254.33 I just-- like all
this stuff, it's
3256.94 so important to be comprehensive
with how we treat these things.
3259.612 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
3260.57 These are incredibly
important points.
3262.693 And to my knowledge,
I don't think
3264.11 anyone has really described
it in a cohesive way the way
3267.11 that you're doing here.
3268.44 So important for people
to understand this
3270.32 because obviously,
as a neuroscientist,
3272.12 I think the nervous system
is creating our thoughts,
3275.33 our thoughts and feelings
are related to psychology,
3277.82 and therefore, of course, our
physiology and our psychology
3280.37 are one and the same.
3281.468 It's bidirectional.
3282.26 Now, nowadays, there's a lot
of interest in brain, body,
3285.66 and particular gut--
3287.06 brain axis and we
can talk about that.
3289.775 But I really
appreciate that you're
3291.932 spelling out how there are
these different variables.
3294.14 Each one can account for a
number of different things.
3296.39 Exercise clearly has a
remarkably potent effect--
3299.778 both during the exercise
in terms of caloric burn
3301.82 and overall health
and biomarkers.
3303.26 And then this is
wonderful to learn
3305.99 that it can increase the
sensitivity to satiety signals.
3309.95 I think that makes--
at least in my mind,
3312.23 places very high on the
list of things that people
3314.75 should absolutely do.
3316.02 But there are other factors too.
3318.92 And the identity
piece is fascinating.
3322.647 It reminds me also-- your
story reminds me also of David
3324.98 Goggins who is--
3326.74 he talks about his former
very overweight self
3329.78 almost as if it was
a different person.
3332.63 And he uses language that
I'm not going to use here.
3335.54 But you know what?
3336.5 I've met David, know David
a bit, and his every bit
3339.11 is intense and driven as
and a remarkable human
3341.75 being as he appears
to be online.
3344.06 He is that guy.
3346.07 But it does seem like he
had to more or less kill off
3349.1 a former version of himself and
continues to do that every day.
3352.59 And I think what your point
about this other fellow who
3356.756 does it through a similar
process, the word "today"
3360.08 seems to really matter.
3361.25 It's not like you defeat this
former version of yourself
3364.25 and then that person
is buried and gone,
3366.74 you said, you know, I
killed my clone today,
3368.99 and that's the way that
David talks about it also.
3371.39 So this is a daily process.
3373.26 And I think this is not just a
small detail in time together
3377.402 all these things.
3378.11 I think that what
you are describing
3380.06 is fundamental,
because we can pull
3381.945 on each one of these
variables and talk
3383.57 about each one of them.
3384.72 But at the end of the day,
we are a cohesive whole
3387.02 as an individual.
3389.97 Sorry.
3390.47 You were about to say.
3391.387 LAYNE NORTON: That gets actually
into one of my favorite topics,
3394.2 which is, why do we have such
a hard time with losing weight
3398.84 but more so keeping it off?
3399.98 Because of obese people, six
out of every seven obese people
3404.21 will lose a significant amount
of body weight in their life.
3407.04 So why do we still have
an obesity problem?
3409.34 They don't keep it off.
3410.87 Why don't they keep it off?
3412.55 When you look at the
research, basically,
3415.31 what it suggests is
because people think about,
3419.07 I am going to do a diet, and
I'm going to lose this weight,
3421.56 and they do not give any thought
to what happens afterwards.
3425.7 It's like think about if you
have some chronic disease
3429.7 or a diabetic.
3431.23 You can't just take insulin
once and that's it, right?
3433.81 You've got to take it
continuously, otherwise,
3436.54 you're going to have problems.
3439.42 If you do a diet and you
lose 30 pounds, fantastic.
3447.02 But if you then just go
back to all your old habits,
3451.24 you're going to go back to
where you were, if not more.
3454.75 You can't create a new
version of yourself
3457.0 while dragging your old habits
and behaviors behind you.
3459.88 So what I'll tell people is--
3462.31 because people say, well,
I'm doing a carnivore diet
3465.25 or I'm doing this
diet or that diet.
3467.14 And I'll say that's fine.
3469.39 Do you see yourself doing that
for the rest of your life?
3472.1 And if the answer is
yes, if you really
3473.883 believe that that's going
to be sustainable for you,
3476.05 and plenty of people, low carb,
intermittent fasting, whatever,
3479.62 they say, I felt easy.
3481.51 I could do this forever.
3483.34 Great.
3485.62 If you're going to lose weight,
you have to invoke some form
3488.56 of restriction-- whether it is
a nutrient restriction like low
3491.5 carb, low fat, a
time restriction--
3494.44 intermittent fasting any form
of time restricted eating,
3497.29 or calorie restriction--
3499.3 tracking macros, whatever.
3501.04 So you get to pick the
form of restriction.
3504.49 So pick the form
of restriction that
3506.86 feels the least restrictive
to you as an individual,
3510.25 and also do not
assume that it will
3513.07 feel the same for everybody else
because I made this mistake.
3516.19 Whereas it's like,
I track things.
3518.54 And so I allow myself to
eat a variety of foods,
3520.9 I allow myself to
eat some fun foods.
3523.09 But I track everything, and
I'm able to modify my body
3526.405 composition and be in
good health doing that.
3528.28 Now, doesn't feel hard for me.
3531.53 Part of it, I've just
been doing it for so long.
3533.53 But to other people,
that's very stressful.
3535.63 They don't want to--
3536.463 they say, well, I'd rather
just not eat for 16 hours.
3539.53 If that feels easy for them,
do that because the one thing
3542.92 that-- there was a couple of
meta analysis on popular diets.
3546.952 And basically, what
they showed was
3548.41 they were all equally terrible
for long term weight loss.
3551.8 But when they stratified them
by adherence-- and none of them
3556.9 were better for
adherence overall.
3558.98 But when they
stratified people just
3560.56 according from lowest
adherence to best adherence,
3562.75 there it was a linear
effect on weight loss.
3565.64 So really what it
says is, what is
3568.66 the diet that's going to be
easiest for you to adhere to
3571.21 in the long term and you
should probably do that?
3574.93 And people-- again, this is
where I step back and take
3578.44 the 10,000-foot view.
3580.06 Somebody will say,
well, I'm going
3581.86 to do ketogenic because I want
to increase my fat oxidation
3585.063 and I want to do this.
3585.98 And they're talking about
all these mechanisms
3587.26 and everything.
3587.89 And that's great.
3589.87 Can you do it for the
rest of your life?
3592.29 Is this going to be something
sustainable for you?
3594.53 And if the answer
is, no, you probably
3597.04 need to rethink what your
approach is going to be.
3600.535 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Incredibly
important message.
3604.39 Basically, that.
3606.04 If I could highlight-- if there
was a version of highlight
3608.56 or boldface and underline
in the podcast space,
3611.8 I would highlight-- boldface and
underline what you just said.
3615.73 And for those of
you that heard it,
3617.47 listen to it twice,
and then go forward
3619.24 because it's absolutely key.
3620.96 I think it also explains a lot
of the so-called controversy
3624.67 that exists out there.
3625.66 I think it also crosses over
with the placebo effect.
3628.55 I almost want to say,
pick the nutrition plan
3632.2 that you think you can stick
to for a long period of time,
3635.9 ideally forever.
3636.79 And pick your placebo
too, because there
3639.55 is a lot of placebo
woven into each
3641.17 and every one of these things--
intermittent fasting, keto.
3645.46 Probably even vegan versus
omnivore versus carnivore.
3649.045 LAYNE NORTON: Well, they even
talk about the diet-- honeymoon
3652.15 period where you go into a
diet and you're all fired up
3655.21 about it and like
you're very adherent,
3656.86 and then what happens,
with every single diet
3659.35 without exception
in research studies
3661.18 is once you get past few
months, adherence just
3663.34 starts waiting and going off.
3665.13 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Here
we are really talking
3666.922 about a form of relationship.
3669.21 I'm not saying that
to be tongue in cheek.
3671.05 Actually, we had a guest early
on in the podcast, Dr. Karl
3673.78 Deisseroth, he's a psychiatrist
and a bioengineer at Stanford.
3678.22 Tremendously successful.
3679.3 Alaska award winner, et cetera.
3680.95 And he talked about love as a
sort of an interesting aspect
3685.78 of our psychology
where it's a story
3688.69 that you co-create with
somebody but that you live
3691.12 into the future of that story.
3692.95 When you pair up
with somebody that
3695.12 was referring to romantic
love, that there's
3697.78 this sort of mutual agreement
to create this idea that you're
3701.32 going to live into.
3702.25 So it's not just about how
you feel in the moment,
3704.333 it's also that you project
into the future quite a lot.
3706.75 I'm seeing a lot of
parallels with a highly
3709.81 functional and effective diet.
3712.39 And I love it.
3713.14 I'm not setting this
parallel up artificially,
3715.508 I'm setting up because I
think that ultimately it
3717.55 boils down to what you
said earlier, which
3719.62 is that the brain and our
decisions about what we
3721.87 are going to stick to are
tremendously powerful.
3725.44 LAYNE NORTON: I think one thing
I will say is keep in mind,
3729.13 when you look at the research
data, the meta analyzes on say,
3732.49 time-restricted eating versus
none, when calories are
3735.43 equated, doesn't seem to
be a difference in weight
3737.8 loss, fat loss, and most
biomarkers of health.
3740.74 Same thing for low
carb versus low fat.
3743.14 Fewer quick calories
and protein.
3744.85 There was a meta analysis done
by Kevin Hall back in 2017
3748.21 where they looked at the-- and
again, actual loss of body fat.
3752.02 And another important
point was, I think
3754.712 there was 22 studies in this.
3755.92 But all of them provided
food to the participants
3759.13 That's important because
that ensures that adherence
3762.172 can be much higher
in those studies
3763.63 whereas various free
living studies, sometimes,
3765.94 you can see funky results.
3767.19 ANDREW HUBERMAN: People
are sneaking food
3769.72 or they're just not really--
3771.115 LAYNE NORTON: It's
very difficult--
3772.21 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--eating the way
3772.48 that the study would
ideally have them eat.
3774.61 LAYNE NORTON:
Unless the person is
3776.17 getting like continuous
support-- like,
3778.18 studies where they
have a dietician talk
3779.92 to people like every
week tend to actually
3782.17 have pretty good adherence.
3783.41 I mean, that's expensive
to have done the study.
3785.41 And again, like what limits
studies, money, money,
3788.32 and money.
3790.99 But the low carb versus low
fat, protein, and calories
3795.52 are equated, basically,
no difference in fat loss.
3798.617 Now, some people get
upset about this.
3800.2 But it's like--
what to me, that's
3801.4 like-- this is great because you
get to pick the tool you want.
3804.22 The one tool, it
doesn't seem to be
3805.71 that much better than another.
3806.96 So pick the one
that works for you.
3808.875 Whatever lever
you've got a pull,
3810.25 you've got a bunch
of different options.
3811.917 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
mentioned picking something
3814.71 that you can stick to
for a period of time.
3816.55 Is there ever a case
for someone saying,
3819.2 look, I like to eat low carb
or even keto for six months
3823.57 and then switch to a
more standard omnivore
3826.06 caloric maintenance type
diet and then switch back?
3829.16 Is there any downside
to doing that
3830.92 for sake of health or
weight loss over time,
3833.277 or weight maintenance over time?
3834.61 Because I realize not everyone
is trying to lose weight.
3837.14 And I definitely
want to talk about,
3838.64 at some point, how to
eat to maintain weight.
3840.79 Because I think there are
a significant fraction
3843.123 of people out there who
are trying to do that.
3845.04 Yeah.
3847.24 Is there any downside
to being a dabbler?
3850.03 Keto for a few months
and then omnivore
3852.34 for a few months, et cetera?
3854.023 LAYNE NORTON: I think that's
actually a great thing,
3856.19 especially to like,
maybe, find what
3857.77 you feel is easiest for you.
3860.92 But in terms of as a
strategy, I mean, I guess,
3864.76 some people just might
get into dopamine
3867.49 but like, oh, change
and get something new.
3869.92 And you feel a little bit
more positive about it.
3871.98 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
do partner model.
3872.65 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
3872.92 Yeah.
3873.13 Exactly.
3873.73 So I don't think it's how I
would usually set things up
3877.63 initially for somebody,
but if somebody said, hey,
3879.98 I just like to have some
variety and change it up,
3882.46 as long as they're still like--
3884.605 their behaviors and they're
doing portion control
3887.05 or whatever it is, and
they're able to sustain
3889.69 a calorie deficit or depending
on whatever their goal is,
3892.6 I don't think there's
really any downside to it.
3894.74 I do think the one thing
to keep in mind is,
3897.25 when you look at like
going between extremes,
3899.48 so like low fat to low
carb or vise versa,
3905.37 there can be, in that
transition, period a little bit
3908.13 of weirdness for lack
of a better term.
3911.16 Like for example, if you've
been on a ketogenic diet and all
3915.06 of a sudden, you move
to a higher carb diet,
3917.85 you'll be basically
insulin resistant
3920.79 for just a short period of time.
3922.66 Now, is that going to
cause any health problems?
3924.66 Probably not in the long term,
especially, if you're still
3927.51 controlling calories.
3928.89 But just because your body has
like upregulated these systems,
3933.33 dealing mostly with fat
and glucose production
3937.41 rather than glucose
metabolism, so now
3939.75 if you start taking glucose
or carbohydrate back in,
3942.928 like for example, you get
somebody-- or a glucose
3944.97 tolerance test after
they've been on keto,
3947.43 they'll do pretty
terribly at it.
3949.487 But that doesn't last that long.
3950.82 ANDREW HUBERMAN: About how long?
3951.75 LAYNE NORTON: A few weeks.
3952.665 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think that's
important for people to know,
3955.207 because I have a feeling
during those first few weeks
3957.758 are the period of time
when a lot of people
3959.55 go running back to what
they were doing previously.
3962.26 Which is not to say that they
shouldn't, but I've certainly
3965.34 done that.
3965.85 I've tried very low
carbohydrate diet,
3968.16 and I would have assumed--
3969.39 and now I know I'm
completely wrong,
3971.16 but I assumed that I was
so carbohydrate starved
3975.03 for so long that my
insulin sensitivity, which
3978.24 is a good thing,
by the way folks,
3979.77 would have gone
through the roof,
3981.64 and I would be able to just
sponge up every bit of glucose
3984.15 that I would have ingested
through carbohydrate.
3986.15 So I did indeed switch over.
3987.67 And I felt like I had
pretty terrible brain fog.
3989.97 I even got some jitters.
3990.99 And I thought, what is this?
3992.385 My blood sugar was low
before, and now my blood sugar
3994.74 should be in more
moderate territory.
3996.99 But based on what
you just said, I'd
3999.03 upregulated the
enzymes and systems
4001.46 in the body for fat
metabolism on the keto diet
4004.85 and then switching over--
4006.98 there was basically a ramping up
of the molecules involved in--
4011.833 presumably in glycolysis.
4012.875 LAYNE NORTON: Transition period.
4013.97 I mean, think about if you
haven't weight trained before
4015.83 and you start weight
training, you're
4016.76 going to feel pretty terrible.
4017.93 Like you're going
to be sore and stiff
4019.46 and all that kind of stuff.
4020.585 But I will say, you aren't
necessarily wrong in what
4023.327 you said about being
more insulin sensitive,
4025.16 because it depends on how you
measure insulin sensitivity.
4029.16 So if you measure with something
like fasting blood glucose
4034.22 or fasting insulin
or even HOMA-IR,
4037.1 those tend to be pretty
good on low carb.
4039.708 But then if you do it all
glucose tolerance test,
4041.75 it tends to be pretty bad.
4043.14 And so it depends on
your specific measure.
4047.27 So I think that
the idea that keto
4051.82 makes you glucose intolerant
or insulin resistant,
4056.29 I think, again, it's
just a transition period.
4059.08 And I'm not too
worried about it.
4060.463 But it is something
important to keep in mind.
4062.38 And one of the reasons
like if somebody
4064.005 was to transition out
of keto, typically,
4066.07 if I'm working with them
or one of our coaches
4068.14 are working with
them, we'll kind of
4069.79 instruct them to do it like
slowly and systematically
4073.15 over like a four to
eight-week period.
4075.1 That way, hopefully, they're
not having that period
4077.695 of two weeks where
they're like, oh, man, why
4079.57 do I feel so terrible?
4081.29 ANDREW HUBERMAN: A
very important point.
4083.67 I want to go to the other end
literally and figuratively
4087.76 and talk about gut
health, because up
4090.99 until now, and certainly--
4092.19 LAYNE NORTON: I see what
you did with that pun.
4094.148 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And certainly
in the last few minutes,
4096.939 we've been talking a lot
about top-down processes.
4099.614 The brain, the psychology,
placebo effects,
4102.689 but the very real
aspects of those,
4104.939 not that I can imagine 2,000
calories, 1,000 calories
4108.63 and somehow change the
law of thermodynamics.
4110.52 Can't do that.
4111.103 But we've been
top-down in integrating
4113.279 a lot of different
ideas into weight loss
4116.069 maintenance and weight gain.
4118.05 But gut health, at least
the more popular studies
4121.89 on gut health, have blown a
lot of things out of the water.
4126.27 For instance, this idea that
you could take obese mice
4128.91 and literally give them fecal
transplants from lean mice,
4132.24 and yes, that sounds
like what it sounds like.
4136.38 Fecal transplants definitely
inserted through the same end
4140.232 in which it comes out.
4141.149 And I point that out because
a lot of people have asked me
4142.859 that they-- and it was kind of
scary to me, I thought, yes,
4145.56 this is not about
ingesting feces, this is--
4148.47 they literally do a transplant
of these from lean mice
4152.13 into obese mice and the
obese mice get lean.
4154.83 And yes, this has
been done in humans.
4157.35 Limited number of studies and
observed some pretty impressive
4160.74 effects on weight loss
that I have to assume
4163.77 could be related
to placebo effect.
4165.814 They might have told these
obese people, hey, look,
4167.939 you're going to get lean
through this fecal transplant
4169.74 from lean people.
4170.609 But more likely,
it had some effect
4174.09 on their core physiology.
4176.279 I don't know which
aspects although,
4177.81 I can speculate which ones.
4179.899 And they became leaner.
4181.64 They lost weight.
4182.66 And that is, in some sense,
miraculous, especially given
4186.649 the important role of psychology
and exercise and satiety
4189.649 signals, because I'm going to
assume that they controlled
4192.146 for a number of those
other variables,
4193.729 although no study is perfect.
4195.32 What are your thoughts
about gut health
4197.33 as it relates to metabolism,
energy utilization,
4201.17 and balance?
4202.128 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
4202.92 So the first thing I'll say is
I'm not a gut health expert,
4206.07 but I will--
4207.583 I feel relatively comfortable
talking about it based
4209.75 on conversations I've had
with people who are experts--
4212.15 one being Suzanne
Devkota who's--
4216.388 you're familiar with her?
4217.43 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, she's sort
4218.36 of a phenom in this area
from what I understood.
4220.31 LAYNE NORTON: So
she was actually
4220.91 doing her masters when I was
doing my PhD in Lehman's lab.
4223.638 So she was one of my lab mates.
4224.93 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific.
4226.013 LAYNE NORTON: And the
other thing to say
4229.94 is, even gut health experts,
and Suzanne will tell you this,
4235.16 they're like, talk
to me in 20 years.
4237.38 We just know so little.
4239.27 I think that's an overall thing
that people don't understand
4241.91 is the scientific consensus
moves very, very slow, probably
4246.41 for good reason.
4247.29 Because if we just flipped
our scientific consensus based
4250.7 on one study, I mean,
it would be a mess.
4256.04 So it's going to take
time before we really
4258.35 understand the implications
of the gut and what it means.
4264.33 So when it comes to weight
loss, there probably
4269.92 is a role in there.
4271.0 I mean, we've seen that
there's something going on.
4273.73 Now, whether that's-- is
it something where a gut
4281.32 microbiome make makeup that's
more obese resistant, perhaps,
4285.37 it extracts less calories
out of the food you eat.
4288.67 Or perhaps, it's elevating BMR.
4291.47 Although, I think that that's
probably somewhat unlikely.
4293.845 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you
think it could impact
4295.72 the way satiety signals are?
4297.018 LAYNE NORTON: So that's--
4298.06 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean,
back to the brain again.
4299.53 LAYNE NORTON: --so that's--
we know that there's a link
4301.822 in the gut brain axis.
4303.61 And so my suspicion
is that it probably
4306.82 is working via
appetite regulation.
4310.43 So I mean, if we look at
the most effective obesity
4316.33 treatments out there,
which is like semaglutide,
4319.9 I mean, you
consistently see a 15%
4323.56 on average loss of body
weight, which is massive
4325.63 and people keep it off.
4327.49 That is a GLP-1 mimetic
which is a gut hormone.
4330.67 And it, basically, just is a
very, very powerful appetite
4335.26 suppressant.
4336.02 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I
guess I'm interrupting,
4338.02 but hopefully, with a purpose.
4339.94 There's this really
interesting study.
4341.65 And it's in mice,
admittedly, but published
4344.05 in a neuroscience
journal recently.
4345.55 And basically, the takeaway
is that like so many things
4348.7 in neuroscience, the GLP-1
works in two parallel pathways.
4352.9 In the brain, it seems
to impact neurons
4354.892 in the hypothalamus
that control satiety.
4356.6 So exactly what you're saying.
4358.03 And in the gut,
it seems to create
4361.36 an activation of the
mechanosensors in the gut.
4364.34 So the perception is that the
gut is full even-- or fuller.
4368.505 I should say, not
full, because I
4369.88 think people who take
semaglutide don't feel bloated.
4373.03 I don't know, they might.
4374.11 But that one feels as if
their gut is actually fuller
4377.95 because these mechanical
sensors that send-- stretch
4380.117 are sending signals
to the brain,
4381.492 oh, I actually have some food.
4382.79 I'm not empty down there.
4383.892 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
4384.725 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anyway,
I'm tickled by this result
4387.43 mostly because every time I
hear about a drug or a molecule
4391.18 having an effect, we think it
has an effect at one location.
4393.76 But it's kind of interesting
that, especially for something
4396.52 like appetite regulation,
that it would be impacting
4399.28 body and brain in parallel.
4400.42 Anyway, forgive me.
4401.26 LAYNE NORTON: That's great.
4402.385 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can tell
I'm really excited about this.
4405.7 And here you are telling
a neuroscientist, me,
4408.49 that a lot, perhaps,
circles back to these brain
4412.44 mechanisms of satiety.
4413.475 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
4414.69 I mean, I think that--
4418.37 and especially looking at
the research on leptin,
4420.89 you we used to think,
OK, metabolism is mostly
4426.45 like liver-based
and then there's
4430.56 metabolism in the adipocyte
and skeletal muscle.
4433.2 But none of this stuff
exists in isolation.
4435.45 There's so much crosstalk
between these pathways.
4437.79 And that's-- when we
get into mechanisms--
4441.16 though one of the things
I love mechanisms.
4444.042 But one of the
things I tell people
4445.5 is keep in mind that when
you're dealing with an outcome,
4448.65 like when I say
outcome-based, we're
4450.99 talking about physical outcomes
like weight loss, fat loss,
4454.81 changes in blood
markers, whatever,
4458.08 though that is the
summation of thousands
4460.84 of different mechanisms.
4462.53 So sure, sometimes, you can
affect a mechanistic pathway,
4467.05 and you get straight down the
line outcome, but not always.
4471.01 Whenever you make a treatment
or anything into the system,
4476.86 it's like throwing
a pebble in a lake.
4479.5 It creates ripples.
4480.85 And we don't always know
what those are going to be.
4485.35 And that's why-- I mean,
we've seen certain drugs,
4488.74 what works on this pathway.
4490.237 And then they list off
all the side effects.
4492.07 And you go, well, how would it
create that many side effects?
4494.612 Because nothing--
for the most part,
4496.9 they don't just
work in one place.
4499.03 There's multitude
of places it works.
4502.12 And to your point
about semaglutide
4505.15 and the effects on
mechanical sensors,
4508.425 it's probably why
a lot of people
4509.8 report actually low grade nausea
when they're using semaglutide.
4515.883 Because of that.
4516.55 Because if you're-- that feeling
is usually not like a real
4520.21 comfortable feeling, but I mean,
it will get you to not eat.
4523.45 So I think there's absolutely
likely a connection,
4528.88 but we haven't fully
elucidated how that works.
4531.54 And we think about how
complicated the gut is.
4534.43 I think I heard
something like there's
4537.13 more cells in our microbiome by
far than there are in our body.
4541.19 So we're actually more--
4542.62 in terms of a cell
per cell level,
4544.84 we're actually more bacteria
than we are eukaryote.
4547.54 ANDREW HUBERMAN: There's
Justin Sonnenburg
4549.325 who's one of the world
experts on microbiome.
4551.2 He's in the lab upstairs
from mine at Stanford.
4553.3 And he has this idea--
4555.64 it's just an idea that because
we are indeed more bacteria
4558.94 than we are cells, the
question is, who's the host
4561.27 and who's the passenger?
4562.27 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
4563.2 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe,
we are just-- maybe
4565.21 they're exploiting us to take
them around and interact,
4568.12 because they interact
and grow on one another.
4570.355 And so this idea that
this freaks people out,
4572.23 Lex Fridman will love this.
4573.355 That maybe human beings
are just actually
4575.2 the vehicles for the microbiome
and not the other way around.
4578.68 Anyway, kind of a scary thought.
4582.4 Do you do anything specifically
to support your gut microbiome?
4586.03 Are you a probiotic guy or a
fermented foods guy or a fiber
4589.475 guy?
4589.975 LAYNE NORTON: So-- again, I'm
going to kind of go straight
4592.773 down the line from
what I've heard
4594.19 from Suzanne and other experts.
4595.52 So if you want to improve gut
health, one of the biggest
4599.66 levers--
4600.548 the three biggest
levers you can pull
4602.09 is not eating too many
calories, exercising--
4606.17 there is a connection
between exercise and the gut,
4608.9 and fiber.
4610.02 So it is-- of the
things we know,
4614.91 dietary fiber seems to
positively impact the gut
4618.59 because it is what's
called a prebiotic.
4620.81 So your gut microbiota can
take, especially, soluble fiber.
4625.77 Although, there's actually some
evidence, at least in mice,
4628.34 that they might be able to use
some insoluble fiber as well.
4632.313 I think Suzanne was doing a
study looking at hemicellulose
4634.73 and actually seeing that
some, like specific forms
4637.1 of microbiota, flourish with
hemicellulose suggesting
4640.165 that they may
actually be getting
4641.54 some kind of fuel out of it,
which is really interesting.
4644.6 But again, in mice--
so just a huge caveat.
4648.59 So your gut
microbiome can produce
4651.92 these short chain fatty acids
by fermenting the soluble fiber.
4659.61 And there's quite
a bit of evidence
4661.85 that these volatile fatty
acids, which can be then
4665.24 actually reabsorbed
into the liver,
4668.12 that they have some
positive effects.
4670.4 Like for example, butyrate.
4671.6 When they've done
butyrate supplementation,
4673.392 they've actually seen positive
effects on insulin sensitivity.
4676.11 So what we seem to understand
is that more diversity seems
4683.98 to be better, fiber
seems to be positive,
4687.76 prebiotics seem to work
much better than probiotics.
4690.002 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Supplemented prebiotics.
4691.71 LAYNE NORTON: Yes.
4692.47 So the problem with
most of the probiotics
4695.59 is they're typically
not concentrated enough
4700.12 to actually colonize.
4701.68 And even if you do colonize,
what happens is like,
4705.43 let's say you colonize
some microbiota that you
4708.73 didn't really have much of.
4710.86 If you're not fueling it
with the appropriate fiber,
4714.44 it's not going to stay anyway,
because it's essentially
4716.89 going to starve.
4718.16 So the research seems to
really clearly suggest
4721.39 that eating enough fiber,
which is, again, a prebiotic,
4724.87 that that is a better way
to get a healthier gut per
4728.98 se than probiotic.
4730.585 ANDREW HUBERMAN: What
fiber sources do you use?
4733.0 And I think-- I mean, I realize
there's a huge array of choices
4735.815 out there, but people
will want to have
4737.44 some ideas as to how
they could, perhaps,
4739.47 mimic what you're doing.
4740.47 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
4741.262 And I would just say diversity.
4743.44 So there's various evidence
from various different fiber
4748.84 sources--
4750.22 fruits and vegetables,
obviously, grains,
4754.27 some whole grains, some cereals,
and then various other sources.
4759.17 So this is one of the
things where we don't really
4761.5 have a good idea.
4762.73 If you know this
one source of fiber
4764.89 is better than another
source of fiber,
4766.75 we just know that fiber
overall is pretty good.
4768.94 And one thing I'll
tell people is
4770.315 like if you want a
longevity hack, I mean,
4772.24 fiber is kind of
the longevity hack.
4773.92 If you look at some of
these cohort studies,
4776.38 there was actually a recent
really large meta analysis
4779.47 of over a million subjects.
4782.84 And basically, what it showed
was that for every 10 gram
4786.97 increase in fiber, there
was a 10% reduction
4790.57 in the risk of mortality.
4792.46 And that extended, specifically,
also to cardiovascular disease
4796.36 and cancer.
4797.87 So one of the things
I'll tell people
4799.42 when they get like
really into whether it's
4801.55 intermittent fasting or
all these other things,
4803.56 say, that's great, that's great.
4804.893 Are you eating like over
50, 60 grams of fiber a day?
4808.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Conceptualize 50 or 60 grams.
4810.23 So if I were to eat
like a-- let's just say,
4813.97 a quarter plate of
broccoli and the broccoli
4818.17 isn't stacked to the ceiling.
4819.38 The broccoli is just
reasonably stacked on there.
4822.512 Approximately, how many
grams of fiber is that?
4824.47 If it's like two
cups of broccoli.
4826.317 There's a lot.
4826.9 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
4827.692 So like 200 grams of broccoli,
per se, would probably be like
4830.65 5, 6 grams of fiber.
4831.825 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I need
to get how much per day?
4833.475 LAYNE NORTON:
Well, I would say--
4834.58 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ideally.
4835.33 LAYNE NORTON: --typically,
what the recommended dose
4837.497 is is 15 grams
per 1,000 calories
4840.01 intake because if you're
eating low calories,
4843.39 it's difficult to
get enough fiber in.
4845.71 But based on-- and again,
these are cohort studies.
4849.55 But you can't do 20-year
long randomized human control
4852.16 trials, unfortunately.
4854.95 That doesn't really appear
to be a top end, at least
4857.8 for the benefits of fiber.
4859.12 It probably boils down to
how much you can tolerate
4861.58 without feeling uncomfortable.
4863.14 Because if you're eating
like a ton of fiber, I mean,
4866.23 at some point, it's not
going to be very comfortable.
4868.81 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
4869.727 Exercise becomes
uncomfortable or hazardous.
4871.6 Yeah.
4872.1 LAYNE NORTON: And I actually a--
4874.34 kind of touching on that
because I think it is important.
4877.94 A lot of people have kind of--
4879.98 in the carnivore community said,
well, you don't need fiber,
4882.71 you poop just fine without it.
4884.34 And I'll always say, well,
pooping is the last reason
4887.15 to have fiber.
4888.05 Like yes, it does help.
4889.01 It does seem to make
elimination easier,
4892.52 you can do it more frequently,
adds bulk to stool.
4895.563 But that's not why
you should eat fiber.
4897.23 Why should eat fiber is because
of the effects of mortality.
4900.8 And some of the pushback
will be, well, this
4903.23 is healthy user bias.
4905.03 And what I'll say is--
4906.29 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning,
healthy people do this
4907.55 and therefore it's working.
4908.24 LAYNE NORTON: Healthy people
eat more fiber and therefore--
4909.89 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
4910.19 Yeah.
4910.46 LAYNE NORTON: And I mean, yeah.
4911.75 There's something to that.
4912.833 But if it was just
healthy user bias,
4914.56 typically, you would
see some disagreement
4916.31 between the studies.
4917.27 And a great example of
that is like red meat.
4919.37 So not every study shows
red meat has an association
4923.77 with cancer and mortality.
4925.103 There's differences depending
on the population use,
4927.27 depending on what they define
as high red meat, low red meat,
4930.06 whether it's
processed, unprocessed.
4932.49 But I have not found
a study on fiber
4935.61 and cardiovascular disease
and cancer and mortality
4940.59 where it did not show
improvements from higher fiber.
4943.44 So to me, that suggests
that that effect is real.
4948.03 And so again, as much fiber
as you can get in comfortably,
4953.1 I would try to do
it because it seems
4955.14 to have some really
powerful effects
4956.64 and is good for
the gut microbiome.
4959.13 The other thing that
may be a consideration
4961.86 for the microbiome is
there's some evidence that
4964.65 saturated fat may not be
great for the microbiome.
4967.17 That it reduces the
prevalence of some
4972.09 of the more positive
strains of bacteria.
4974.22 And that appears to be not so
much from the saturated fat
4977.28 itself but from the
bile end products
4979.56 that combine with
saturated fat seems
4982.175 to have a negative
effect on some
4983.55 of these more healthier
forms of gut microbiota.
4988.22 But again, this is
really difficult
4989.99 because we don't
even know necessarily
4993.23 yet which species
of gut microbiota
4996.65 are positive or negative.
4998.4 And that's-- I mean, this gets
into some of these studies
5001.15 where they may
call it dysbiosis.
5004.38 Sounds scary, but dysbiosis
just means that the gut changed.
5007.052 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
5008.01 LAYNE NORTON: It
doesn't necessarily--
5009.18 it doesn't tell you
anything qualitative
5011.22 about whether the
change was bad or good.
5013.297 And so these are
just things, I think,
5014.88 we need to keep in mind when
we talk about this stuff.
5017.13 That this stuff is still
very much in its infancy.
5019.23 But in terms of the
big levers, I mean,
5022.013 it's pretty much
fits with what we
5023.43 know about a healthy lifestyle.
5024.84 Exercise, don't eat too much,
consume a good amount of fiber
5029.61 from diverse sources.
5031.59 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic.
5033.15 Fantastic because
it fits with what
5035.28 I like to think of as the
center of mass of evidence.
5038.91 And I'm starting to get
some window into what
5040.95 your process is around selection
of studies and no one study
5044.88 being wholly, but
when you look at,
5046.83 as you mentioned, all
the studies on fiber
5048.84 having a positive effect
to some degree or another,
5051.71 it's pretty hard to refute that
there isn't something really
5054.21 interesting there.
5055.04 LAYNE NORTON: And one thing
I'll tell people is like,
5058.79 one study--
5060.24 I mean, sometimes
I'll change my opinion
5062.563 based on a single
study when it's really
5064.23 well done and very powerful.
5066.3 But usually, one
study is just going
5067.98 to move me just a little bit.
5069.188 And then maybe, if
another one comes out,
5070.897 maybe a little bit more.
5071.91 And then like very slowly,
I'm going to get some--
5073.993 I mean, my experience
with LDL cholesterol,
5077.61 that's something I changed
my mind on a while back.
5079.74 When I was younger, like circa
2005 getting into grad school,
5084.54 the prevailing thought was,
well, it's not so much the LDL,
5087.63 it's the ratio of LDL to
HDL, that's what matters.
5091.77 And probably about
five years ago--
5094.48 and I was pretty strong
about that opinion,
5096.84 and then five years ago
looking at these Mendelian
5099.09 randomization studies, I went,
I can't hold this position
5102.6 anymore.
5103.47 ANDREW HUBERMAN: What is
your revised position on LDL?
5106.52 LAYNE NORTON: So if you
look at the research,
5109.05 HDL is important because it's
a marker of metabolic health.
5111.93 If you have high
HDL, it suggests
5113.7 that you are metabolically
quite healthy.
5115.53 You very rarely will you
have high HDL and high CRP,
5119.41 which is inflammatory marker
or dysregulated blood glucose.
5123.69 Almost exclusively,
people who have high HDL
5126.21 will have good biomarkers
of metabolic health.
5130.96 But if you take
drugs that raise HDL,
5134.62 it doesn't reduce your risk
of cardiovascular disease.
5138.13 In Mendelian
randomization studies,
5140.35 which Mendelian
randomization basically
5142.09 uses natural randomization.
5144.28 So some people are,
in the case of HDL,
5147.64 naturally higher secreted
or naturally lower
5149.92 secretions of HDL.
5151.45 And we talked about
how-- you can't really
5154.27 do a 20-year human
randomized controlled trial.
5156.46 And when you're trying
to examine something
5158.252 like heart disease, I mean, that
is a lifetime exposure issue.
5161.77 It's very unlikely
that you're going
5163.48 to pick out differences between
treatments in two years or even
5166.72 five years.
5167.32 I mean, people don't develop--
5168.85 typically, don't
develop heart disease
5170.44 until they're in their
50s, 60s, and 70s.
5174.19 What Mendelian randomization
allows is to say,
5178.19 OK, we have these people who
naturally secrete more or less.
5181.82 So we can stratify those and
look at what is their risk.
5185.54 So if you look at people
who are low series of HDL
5188.35 versus high secrete
of HDL withholding
5191.29 some of the other key
variables consistent like LDL,
5194.153 you don't see an effect
on heart disease, really.
5196.195 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Of LDL.
5197.195 LAYNE NORTON: Of HDL.
5198.13 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it, OK.
5199.297 LAYNE NORTON: But
when you look at LDL
5201.82 and you look at the
lifetime exposure to LDL,
5205.19 it is like a linear
effect on heart disease.
5208.02 And we know that it's
actually not so much LDL,
5210.89 but it's more
apolipoprotein B. But that
5214.58 tends to track with
LDL just in general.
5217.2 And if you look
at the mechanism--
5218.69 I mean, we know that LDL can
penetrate the endothelium,
5223.01 so there's the
mechanism is present.
5225.15 If we look at the
epidemiology, it
5227.57 supports that it's an
independent risk factor,
5229.643 and then, again, these
Mendelian randomization
5231.56 studies where we can
look at people's exposure
5233.69 over a lifetime, and then we
see that linear dose-dependent
5237.71 effect.
5238.97 To me, that was
convincing enough
5240.98 to change my mind on
that particular topic.
5242.91 And then if you look at
some of the Framingham data,
5246.44 look at high--
5248.72 if you like stratify, like
high HDL versus low HDL,
5254.1 both groups looking at
high LDL and low LDL.
5258.01 So if you have
high HDL, low LDL,
5261.09 you will still be lower
risk factor than somebody
5263.79 who is high HDL and high LDL.
5266.55 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
the ratio does matter.
5268.38 LAYNE NORTON: The
ratio does better.
5269.29 Same thing with inflammation.
5270.72 If you look at people who are
low inflammation, low LDL,
5276.52 they'll have a lower
risk than people who
5278.5 are low inflammation, high LDL.
5280.438 So again, that was sufficient
for me to change my mind.
5282.73 But it took-- it was like
not just one study came out.
5285.25 It was, OK, then there was
another study, and then
5287.5 another study, ans then another
study, and at a certain point
5290.042 I go, OK, well, now, I
either have to change my mind
5293.35 or I'm, basically, just going
to be cognitively dissonant
5297.58 and say, nope, I don't
believe all that.
5300.13 And so I think that's one of
the things to keep in mind.
5303.67 People will say, oh, are you
saying this is a bad study?
5307.0 Very rarely will I call
something, a bad study,
5309.46 because data is just data.
5312.13 But the issue becomes
how it is presented
5315.58 and how broadly it's applied
in the mainstream media
5319.48 or by people on--
5321.31 fitness influencers.
5323.26 And what I'll do
is try to step in
5326.05 and say, OK, let's consider
x, y and z as well.
5329.93 And then it's not a bad
study, but let's just
5332.74 be careful about how broadly
we apply the interpretation.
5335.153 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
5336.07 Well, and I think you are in
a very unique and important
5339.76 position to be able
to place things
5341.35 into their proper
context because of this,
5345.14 for lack of a better
word, holistic view
5347.29 of how the psychology
placebo effects also core
5352.12 physiology relate
to one another.
5355.01 And so on.
5355.725 In fact, I think that your
training as a biochemist
5357.85 and then training as in
nutrition with somebody who--
5362.02 Don Lemon, who was pushing
you to focus on outcomes,
5365.0 I think that's a
beautiful capture
5367.99 of the continuum at which
one can look at something.
5370.285 Because for those of
you who don't out there,
5372.16 you know a lot of laboratory
studies on mice and humans,
5374.53 for instance, in the
realm of biochemistry
5376.6 or in vitro studies, you'll
see a change in some molecule
5379.6 can be quite dramatic.
5380.6 And then the assumption
is, oh, you just
5381.7 take-- you take the
drugs that will change
5383.453 that molecule in a
particular direction,
5385.12 and then you'll get the effect
you want at the whole organism
5388.58 level.
5389.08 The person will lose weight,
the person will gain muscle,
5391.455 the animal will not have
Alzheimer's, et cetera.
5394.87 But it just doesn't work that
way because of the redundancy,
5397.6 and this interplay.
5399.048 LAYNE NORTON: Well, a
great example of that
5400.84 is, so my research was
actually in rodents.
5404.305 All my studies on protein
metabolism, and leucine,
5407.2 in particular, is
what we were studying.
5409.15 Well, we know if
you give leucine,
5410.65 it increases muscle
protein synthesis.
5412.9 But we also know if you
supplement with leucine,
5415.45 people don't get more muscular.
5416.905 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
was about to say--
5417.61 LAYNE NORTON: So as always--
5418.18 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--all you have to do
5418.69 is supplement with leucine?
5419.65 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
5419.89 Right, right.
5420.432 And so how is that possible?
5422.17 Muscle building is not
just protein synthesis.
5424.64 It's also the balance between
synthesis and degradation.
5427.798 And degradation just happens
to be very, very difficult
5430.09 to measure.
5431.08 But a great example--
5433.72 and again, one of the
cool things about my PhD
5435.85 was actually changed
the way I ate,
5437.83 which I think is interesting.
5439.42 So before, I had been like,
I eat eight meals a day,
5441.723 eat every two
hours, try to keep--
5443.14 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Eight meals a day?
5443.77 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah when
I got to grad school.
5444.73 ANDREW HUBERMAN: In
order to get that 30
5445.63 grams of protein per meal?
5446.86 LAYNE NORTON: Get that
amino drip going in
5448.817 was the idea, right?
5449.65 Like just have an IV
hooked up of amino acids.
5451.96 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Not really, folks.
5453.43 LAYNE NORTON: Not really, yeah.
5454.99 But that was the concept.
5456.61 But the first study that I did,
we, basically, looked at OK,
5462.67 a lot of people had measured the
amplitude of protein synthesis
5466.84 in response to a meal.
5467.92 We wanted to see, how
long does this last
5470.5 and where does it peak, right?
5472.39 And so my thought was, OK.
5474.38 Well, it'll probably
track with plasma leucine.
5478.45 For those that are
not familiar, leucine
5481.33 is the amino acid that
is almost exclusively
5485.03 responsible for increasing
muscle protein synthesis when
5488.06 you eat protein.
5489.0 So it's one of the
branched chain amino acids.
5491.76 So we wanted to see, OK, how
long does this effect last?
5495.36 So we fed these
animals whey protein,
5498.41 and again, I thought, OK, well,
however long plasma leucine,
5501.44 stay up that, will be how long
protein synthesis stays up.
5506.023 And so we got the protein
synthesis data back,
5507.94 and it was peaked at
90 minutes-- or sorry.
5510.37 Peaked from 45 to
90 minutes and, then
5512.98 was back down to
baseline by 180 minutes.
5515.02 And so when I went to do
the plasma leucine analysis,
5518.6 my shock was, at three hours,
plasma leucine was still
5522.56 plateaued out.
5524.31 And then I said,
OK, well, when I
5527.32 look at the initiation factors,
that will show me something.
5529.99 So for those not
familiar, this is part
5533.32 of the mTOR signaling pathway.
5535.1 So one of the--
two of the targets
5537.43 of mTOR, when it's stimulated--
and leucine stimulates mTOR.
5540.91 Two of the targets of mTOR are a
protein compound called 4E-BP1.
5546.37 And then another one is called
a ribosomal protein S6K.
5551.847 So I don't want to get
into the specifics about it
5553.93 because it's going
to be on the scope.
5555.513 But basically, when these things
are phosphorylated by mTOR,
5559.39 it increases the rate of
translation initiation, which
5563.62 translation initiation
is, basically,
5565.42 the process of the ribosome
hooking on to the mRNA
5568.63 and then starting
protein synthesis.
5571.58 So I was looking at
the phosphorylation
5575.78 of 4E-BP1 and RPS6.
5578.372 I was like, OK,
well, I'll probably
5579.83 see these things come
down in three hours.
5582.5 Still plateaued.
5584.24 And so then it was like,
what's going on here?
5587.05 So I actually kept rerunning
the data and rerunning the data
5589.55 and rerunning the data.
5590.54 And I'll never forget, I
went into Lehman's office.
5592.845 And this is like six
months after we've
5594.47 done this study, because
this analysis takes time.
5596.762 I was like, so where are we
with this duration study?
5598.97 I said, well, I just got to
run the plasma data again
5601.178 because it's not right.
5602.69 And he's like, well,
why is it not right?
5605.58 And I said, well,
it just doesn't
5607.37 make any sense you know.
5608.96 And I kind of went through,
he's like well, describe to me
5613.34 your technique.
5614.06 How are you doing this?
5615.018 And I described it,
and he said, well,
5616.83 how is your standard error?
5617.98 And I told him what the
numbers were, he said,
5620.09 it sounds like it's good data.
5621.47 He said, it sounds
like you are trying
5624.11 to get the data to
fit your conclusion
5626.84 and you need to change your
conclusion to fit the data.
5629.81 And that statement--
5631.53 ANDREW HUBERMAN: This
is why we do PhDs.
5633.35 LAYNE NORTON: This
is why, yeah--
5634.25 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
need an advisor--
5635.015 LAYNE NORTON: This is why I
am so skeptical of everything,
5638.15 because I have had so many of
my ideas crushed by my own data,
5642.05 right?
5642.86 So we actually ended up--
5646.775 this kind of effect,
this phenomenon
5648.95 is called muscle protein
synthetic refractory period.
5653.19 So basically, like once
you trigger the system,
5656.48 runs for a defined
period of time
5658.01 and then it takes time
to, essentially, reset
5661.247 for lack of a better term.
5662.33 It's also been referred to
as the muscle full effect.
5666.29 So I looked at that
and said, why am I
5668.18 eating every two hours then?
5670.46 And there was even a study
out of Wolf's Lab back in '99,
5674.36 I think, where they infused
essential amino acids
5677.18 for six hours.
5678.38 Protein synthesis went
up, peaked at 60 minutes,
5681.0 came back down 120, and
never went back up again.
5683.57 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Maybe I'm being naive.
5685.55 But I would have thought that
if protein synthesis goes
5690.53 up and then comes back down,
that eating more often would
5693.74 be exactly the thing you would
want to do if your goal was
5696.35 to get increased protein
synthesis because you'd
5698.51 be pinging the
system periodically.
5700.76 LAYNE NORTON: But the problem
is, the plasma amino acids
5703.328 are still elevated.
5704.12 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
it's, essentially,
5704.9 like eating the whole way
through from the perspective
5707.09 of leucine.
5707.51 LAYNE NORTON: From
the cells, yeah.
5708.455 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
5708.68 LAYNE NORTON: So that was
one of those things where
5710.6 I said, you know what?
5711.23 I'm actually going to eat
less often, because if I'm
5713.397 eating in three hours
later, I've still got capped
5716.48 out plasma amino acids.
5719.54 And we looked at
all kinds of stuff.
5721.04 We looked at intracellular
leucine just to make sure that
5723.74 wasn't falling off, it wasn't.
5725.45 We looked at all the plasma,
essential amino acids
5728.12 because we were thinking,
well, maybe protein synthesis
5731.48 is sucking some of these
amino acids out of the plasma
5734.39 and they're dropping
and that's causing it
5736.28 to short circuit the system.
5738.02 That wasn't the case.
5739.56 It just-- essentially,
what the evidence suggests,
5743.12 I think we're the only
ones to show this so far.
5745.195 So I'm not ready to say
that this is a real effect,
5747.32 because I hold out the idea
that data artifacts do exist
5751.05 and you can't be totally sure.
5753.48 But we saw an
increase in AMP kinase
5758.43 around this mark where protein
synthesis started falling off.
5762.87 And we also saw a decrease
in intracellular ATP.
5766.62 And protein synthesis is
an ATP-dependent process.
5770.44 And so what we think
might be happening is,
5774.51 you're consuming
protein and you're--
5779.8 you're increasing muscle
protein synthesis,
5782.68 and then at a
certain point, it has
5785.2 enough effect on your energy
metabolism in your cells
5789.64 that it short--
5792.13 not short circuits it,
but it cuts it off, right?
5796.06 So again, we're the
only ones to show that.
5798.49 That I'm aware of.
5799.54 And that was again, in rats.
5801.1 So I always talk about data.
5804.31 Like, there's data I'm
willing to bet my toe on,
5807.25 my foot on, my leg
on, and my life on.
5809.44 I'd probably barely bet the end
of my little toe on that one.
5812.27 I'm not quite sure.
5813.135 But it's interesting
nonetheless.
5814.51 So--
5814.795 ANDREW HUBERMAN: A
proportional wait here.
5816.545 LAYNE NORTON: --that's a
great example of, OK, we're
5818.92 looking at this mechanism
of mTOR signaling,
5821.41 and if we just looked
at that, we'd say,
5823.42 oh, well, protein
synthesis is going to stay
5825.253 elevated for past three hours.
5827.29 But that's not what we saw.
5829.12 So yeah.
5830.11 I think, it's, again, that's
why I really try to get people
5833.02 to say, well, let's--
5834.07 mechanisms are important.
5836.257 And especially, if
you're seeing an outcome,
5838.09 it's important to
identify mechanisms
5839.77 that may explain that.
5841.36 But let's step back
from the mechanisms
5843.34 from trying to chase mechanisms.
5845.0 And let's look at
chasing outcomes
5846.79 in terms of what we
recommend to people.
5848.965 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Excellent point.
5850.6 In terms of chasing outcomes,
a number of people I know
5853.6 are interested in weight
loss or weight maintenance.
5856.48 And several times throughout
today's conversation,
5859.45 we've come back to this
issue of satiety signals.
5862.0 Whether or not there are
brain-based, body-based,
5864.042 or both.
5864.895 Not wanting to eat
more is a great way
5867.46 to maintain or lose
weight because you simply
5869.86 don't want to.
5871.43 I heard you mention
earlier that protein
5874.52 and maybe specific types of
protein or sources of protein
5877.61 may provide better
satiety signals
5880.4 than other macronutrients.
5883.13 Could you briefly talk
about how macronutrients,
5886.61 including protein, but also
carbohydrates and fats,
5890.33 impact satiety.
5891.83 And from the
standpoint of somebody
5894.65 who, for instance, would
like to quote unquote, "lose
5897.29 a few pounds," right?
5898.25 Probably would be happy to gain
a little bit of lean body mass
5901.04 provided it was in a
particular location
5902.93 on their body, that
seems to be a thing now.
5905.09 Directed hypertrophy,
if you will.
5907.13 And how much they should focus
on protein as a core component
5913.59 of creating this diet.
5915.79 Assuming everything else
is being done correctly.
5917.918 They're going to hit the
right number of calories
5919.96 relative to their
output NEAT, et cetera.
5925.03 How should we think about
protein and satiety signals?
5927.31 And are animal sources
of protein, indeed,
5930.49 more bioavailable?
5931.87 That's a tricky word.
5934.75 For sake of muscle
building, but also
5936.37 for sake of somebody who just
would like to lose body fat.
5939.04 They don't want to
lose muscle and they'd
5940.42 like to bring their
weight down a few pounds.
5941.905 LAYNE NORTON: So
a lot of things--
5943.15 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or more.
5943.69 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
5943.87 A lot of things to unpack there.
5945.79 Of the macronutrients,
protein is definitely
5947.83 the biggest lever that you
can pull, because even if--
5950.592 it doesn't take a ton of protein
to get a lot of the muscle
5953.05 building benefits.
5953.8 I mean, I think
the benefits really
5955.57 start to plateau out around
1.6 grams per kilogram
5958.63 of body weight.
5959.53 There's some evidence
that maybe even
5961.57 up to like 2.4 or
2.8 grams per kilo
5965.08 may give a little
bit more benefit.
5967.492 I think it probably
looks something
5968.95 like an asymptote
in terms of a curve
5970.96 where as you put
more into the system,
5973.67 you always get a
little bit more,
5975.07 but it just gets to the point
where it's so infinitesimally
5977.528 small benefit that it's for all
intensive purposes, no benefit.
5981.055 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But you
mentioned 1.6 grams of protein
5983.98 per kilogram of body
weight, would you
5985.78 consider that a threshold
that most people
5988.12 should try and achieve daily?
5990.13 LAYNE NORTON: I see very few
downsides to hitting that.
5992.98 I mean, I know some
people-- and this
5994.66 is going to get into a
separate conversation.
5996.02 But I know some
people will say, well,
5997.07 I don't want to stimulate
mTOR because that's
5999.235 going to make me die early.
6000.36 And I think, one of
the things to keep
6002.1 in mind is if you look at--
6005.75 there's kind of
this thought process
6007.25 out there that if
you're stimulating mTOR,
6009.0 that protein is going
to make you die early.
6011.0 And first off, we have
very little human outcome
6013.46 data to support that claim.
6015.38 And the second thing
is, if you look
6017.21 at any macronutrient
isolation, I
6018.76 can make a mechanistic argument
that it's going to kill you.
6021.26 So fat-- if you take
in fat and it decreases
6024.38 flow-mediated dilation.
6025.97 Flow-mediated dilation is
important for heart health
6029.45 in the short term.
6031.16 Carbohydrates stimulate insulin.
6033.65 Insulin, you know,
pro-inflammatory
6036.44 and all these other things.
6037.77 And so I can make an argument
for any single macronutrient
6041.39 to be negative for longevity.
6045.785 I really want people--
6046.97 this is something that
even scientists get wrong.
6049.04 They look at an acute
response of something
6051.41 and assume that is going to
relate to long term outcomes
6054.47 and signaling.
6056.68 So let's just take
exercise, for example.
6060.828 If you didn't know
anything about exercise,
6062.62 and I said to you, Andrew,
I'm going to do something
6065.078 that's going to make you--
your heart rate go up,
6067.12 your blood pressure go up, your
inflammatory markers go up,
6070.36 your reactive oxygen species
increase, you're going to say--
6075.33 and it's going to damage your
muscles, you're going to say,
6078.09 I'm not doing that.
6078.96 That sounds horrible.
6081.15 But it does all those
things in the short term.
6083.76 But what is the long
term effect of exercise?
6086.73 You actually get healthier.
6088.47 All those things improve.
6090.36 Now, I'm not saying that
protein is a longevity hack
6093.36 or anything like that,
but what I'm saying is,
6095.82 I think some of
the arguments out
6097.35 there are based on mechanistic--
6100.05 this increases mTOR, therefore
we don't want to do it.
6103.38 I think it is a much more
complicated argument than just
6106.92 that.
6107.86 So there's that.
6108.72 So protein is the biggest lever.
6110.13 I would shoot for 1.6
grams per kilogram.
6113.11 If you can do more, great.
6114.37 There doesn't seem to be
really downsides to it.
6116.37 Even up to very high
levels of protein.
6118.65 Jose Antonio did
a study, that was
6120.9 a year-long randomized
control trial.
6123.58 And again, it's just one year.
6124.83 But they were looking at all
sorts of different biomarkers.
6128.07 And basically, even up to like
4 grams per kilogram of protein,
6131.55 they couldn't really find
any negative health outcomes
6133.8 from it other than people were
just so satiated, they ended up
6137.31 eating less calories.
6139.32 So protein is a big
lever, because one, it
6143.76 has a higher thermic
effect of food,
6145.26 so you're getting a little
bit more calorie burn per day
6147.593 even though it's not
a ton because TEF
6149.735 is a pretty small percentage
of your overall energy
6151.86 expenditure.
6152.85 But still a benefit.
6154.56 You're getting the
effects on lean body mass.
6156.6 If you're in a diet, it's going
to help preserve lean body
6158.64 mass, if you're at
maintenance, it's
6159.96 going to help build a
preserved lean body mass,
6161.91 and if you're in a
surplus, it's going
6163.493 to help build a
preserved lean body mass.
6166.25 Then you get the
effects on appetite.
6167.96 So now, I want to be careful
because appetite effects tend
6174.07 to be very specific
to individual foods.
6178.24 So you can take a
high protein food
6180.91 and make it not very satiating.
6186.938 So take, for example, like
a really tasty protein
6188.98 bar, which back when we
were getting into this,
6191.8 no such thing existed.
6193.355 Now, you have protein bars that
actually take pretty darn good.
6195.98 But if you eat one of them, I
mean, are you really satiated?
6199.36 I don't really feel satiated,
that's my protein bar.
6201.73 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's
my premeal snack.
6202.84 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
6203.673 Right.
6204.46 So why?
6206.29 Because, I mean, it's
processed, refined,
6209.02 and made to be very palatable.
6212.2 But take something like a
200-gram chicken breast.
6214.9 Very satiating, right?
6216.945 And that's why when people
say, well, carbohydrates
6219.07 aren't very satiating, it
depends on the carbohydrate.
6221.89 I mean, when you look
at the satiety index,
6225.43 a plain baked potato is about
as satiating as it gets.
6228.895 ANDREW HUBERMAN: If I
eat a bowl of oatmeal,
6231.37 I feel pretty good afterward.
6232.648 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
6233.44 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
For a while, right?
6234.31 I mean, I usually--
6235.128 I'll eat that along
with some other things,
6236.92 but I completely agree.
6241.198 So you're saying that the
form that it comes in, maybe,
6243.49 even how much chewing
is required, how good.
6246.02 It smells that your
psychological associations--
6248.71 because to me, a steak
is an incredible meal.
6253.35 I mean, if I had to pick
one food that I could eat,
6255.9 even though I'm
not pure carnivore,
6257.49 for the rest of my life, it
would be that because, I think,
6259.41 it would get me
where I need to go
6260.67 and then I'd probably
have to sneak some fiber.
6262.728 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
6263.52 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But
it's an excellent point.
6266.11 I have a question that I don't
want to take us off track,
6268.8 but I'm hoping it relates enough
that you could answer it now.
6271.98 In the context of
this, if I'm going
6274.14 to eat let's say, 2 grams per
kilogram of body weight protein
6277.92 and I'm not eating
multiple meals,
6280.14 maybe I'm eating two
or three meals per day,
6282.39 I'm certainly going
to be eating more
6284.04 than the 30-gram threshold
that was thrown around
6286.418 for a long time that
we can only assimilate
6288.21 30 grams of protein per meal.
6289.692 Should I just not
worry about that?
6291.15 Some of it is going to go
towards the thermic effect
6293.52 of food, some of that
might be converted
6295.83 into glucose of all things
through gluconeogenesis.
6298.84 So should I worry about
this 30-gram cut off?
6301.14 Because I think balancing the
1.6 gram per kilogram body
6304.8 weight threshold
with number of meals,
6306.6 with the need to exercise
and work and live my life
6308.88 and sleep, et
cetera, pretty soon,
6310.5 you run into bottlenecks
where you just can't do it
6313.02 or you're spending so much
time trying to focus on it.
6315.27 LAYNE NORTON: You can't
optimize all the things
6316.68 at the same time.
6317.415 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You'd lose
your mind and your body.
6319.582 So what is necessary
in terms of frequency
6325.92 if one is getting
enough protein?
6328.17 And then tied into
that question,
6330.57 is there any
reality to this idea
6333.3 that if you eat one meal
per day or you're fasting
6336.36 and then you eat, let's
say, 200 grams of protein
6340.38 in a single feeding, that you
can assimilate more because you
6344.7 were protein starved.
6347.07 Is that a real thing?
6348.545 LAYNE NORTON: So most of
the studies with protein
6352.05 are after a fast because to
assess it with stable isotope,
6356.475 you have to be in
a steady state.
6357.85 So we haven't observed that.
6361.05 It doesn't appear
that fasting really
6363.75 allows you to assimilate
more protein after a fast.
6367.32 So this gets into a core
of one of the things I
6369.54 looked at in my
PhD, which is, does
6371.79 protein distribution matter?
6373.11 Because most Americans get about
65% to 70% of their protein
6377.43 at dinner.
6378.45 Breakfast tends to be pretty
minimal protein foods.
6381.623 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do
any cultures, actually,
6383.415 eat big breakfast and not
a big lunch and dinner?
6386.66 We all heard that was ideal.
6388.4 We'll get into circadian
timing in a little bit,
6390.4 but does anyone
actually do that?
6391.92 Steak and eggs for
breakfast and then
6393.51 taper off the rest of the day?
6394.98 LAYNE NORTON: I
know German culture
6396.0 tends to have a big
breakfast, but also
6397.625 tends to be like sugary
foods and whatnot.
6399.45 As far as like teleological, I'm
actually not sure about that.
6403.99 So if you look at
that, and then you
6406.56 consider that protein
doesn't really
6408.54 have a storage mechanism.
6410.64 People will say, well, lean
tissue is a storage mechanism.
6416.05 That's like saying a house is
a storage facility for wood.
6419.95 Yeah, if the house
is made out of wood
6421.78 you could get wood out of it,
but that's not why you build.
6424.68 You're building the
house out of a demand.
6426.43 Same thing for muscle tissue.
6429.05 There is a free
pool of amino acids,
6431.09 but it's very, very small.
6432.178 So when you consider things
like fat, which, basically,
6434.47 has unlimited storage capacity,
carbohydrate, at relatively
6438.7 large storage
capacity, you can store
6440.41 400 or 500 grams of carbohydrate
between your liver and muscles.
6444.22 And then protein, which almost
has no storage capacity,
6450.85 the idea that, OK,
you could make up
6453.34 for a low protein at one
meal by over consuming
6455.89 another meal didn't
make sense to me.
6458.6 So one of the studies we did--
6460.96 and again, in rats, we took--
6466.0 both groups were getting whey
protein, so a high quality
6469.55 protein, they were getting
the exact same amount
6471.55 of calories, exact same amount
of nitrogen, exact same macros.
6476.41 Everything was the same.
6477.41 The only difference was,
one group, basically,
6480.55 got three meals of similar
amounts of protein.
6484.54 Dinner was a little
bit bigger, because we
6486.37 wanted to keep it somewhat
similar to how people eat.
6488.2 But each meal was going to be
over the threshold to stimulate
6490.78 muscle protein synthesis.
6492.92 Whereas the other
group, I constructed it
6495.96 so the first two
meals of the day
6497.78 should not stimulate
muscle protein synthesis.
6500.1 It should be under
that threshold.
6501.6 And then the last
meal was about 70%
6503.33 of their total daily protein.
6504.9 And so we had them eat
those for 11 weeks.
6507.41 And I'll never forget this.
6508.79 This is how obsessive
I became about it
6510.74 is, there were 110
animals in the study,
6513.5 and I made all the
diets and I weighed out
6517.73 exactly every single meal
for every single animal
6520.46 for 11 weeks.
6521.73 So I was in there at 6:00
AM, I was in there at noon,
6524.84 and I was in there at 6:00 PM.
6526.31 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.
6527.57 That's kind of PhD student
that professors dream of.
6531.29 You're sounding a dream student.
6532.685 LAYNE NORTON: So at
the end of 11 weeks,
6535.28 we looked at like lean body
mass, we looked at body fat,
6538.55 we looked at hind limb weights.
6543.05 We didn't really see
differences in lean body mass,
6545.96 but what we did see
was a difference
6547.695 in hind limb weights.
6548.57 It wasn't massive, but there
was a significant difference
6551.0 in the size of the
muscles of the hind limbs
6553.79 of these animals.
6555.052 And so it's interesting
that there wasn't
6556.76 a difference in lean body mass.
6558.32 And what we found, at least
with the liver, the animals
6562.37 that we're eating one meal
with really high protein,
6568.49 actually had bigger livers,
not like a huge amount and not
6572.415 something that I
would consider unsafe,
6574.04 but it was a statistically
significant difference.
6577.14 And so to me, at
least, like I'm trying
6580.04 to explain like no
difference in lean body mass,
6582.08 but a difference in
these hind limb weights,
6584.21 maybe there's some
sequestering of--
6589.67 that's fueling a little
bit more protein synthesis
6592.64 of the splenic
tissues rather than--
6595.057 because you're capping out
skeletal muscle protein
6597.14 synthesis.
6598.13 And we do know that the
splanchnic tissues are
6600.26 more sensitive or
have a greater rate
6602.63 of protein synthesis per day.
6603.86 Like, the rate of skeletal
muscle protein synthesis
6606.05 in humans is about
like 1% per day.
6609.15 So it takes like 100 days to
turn over skeletal muscle.
6612.92 Whereas like your entire
gut, your entire GI
6615.74 will turn itself over in
like two to three days.
6618.14 So really-- and the liver
also has a very high amount
6621.62 of protein synthesis, which
is one of the reasons.
6623.97 It's actually one of the most
metabolically active organs.
6627.56 So all that to say, it has not--
6630.11 there's been one human study
that showed something similar.
6633.882 And then there's been a
couple of others that didn't.
6636.09 And then in the intermittent
fasting studies, which is maybe
6639.14 a good tool to look at
compared to continuous feeding,
6644.4 one thing I will say is
it looks like the 16/8
6647.51 intermittent fasting style.
6649.1 There's been a couple of
studies with Grant Tinsley.
6652.25 And this is something I've
changed my mind on as well.
6654.52 Grant Tinsley has done
a couple of studies
6656.27 where they did use
the 16/8 protocol.
6658.37 They had them train during
their feeding window,
6661.37 and they had them eat--
6662.51 I think it was at least three
protein-containing meals
6664.948 during those eight hours.
6665.99 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
These are humans?
6666.545 LAYNE NORTON: These are humans.
6667.88 And they saw no difference
in lean body mass
6670.07 at the end of the study
compared to people
6671.82 who were eating as many times as
they wanted throughout the day.
6676.44 Now, if you look at some of the
more extreme forms of fasting,
6681.93 like alternate day fasting
or like 20/2 or 20/4,
6687.81 there are some studies where
you do start to see differences
6690.39 in lean body mass.
6691.38 So my suspicion is,
and I'm just guessing.
6695.76 So this is tenuous.
6697.44 My suspicion is,
probably if you're
6699.27 getting like two to three high
quality protein meals in a day,
6704.82 you're getting the vast majority
of the benefits of protein.
6707.7 The most important thing
is getting enough total.
6710.52 And then secondarily,
trying to get at least two
6713.34 or three meals with
high quality protein in.
6718.09 But if you're going pretty
extreme with like alternate day
6720.51 fasting or maybe
only one meal a day,
6724.2 then I think there may be some
effects on lean body mass.
6727.02 But again, these can be
mitigated as well if you're
6729.57 doing hard resistance training.
6731.52 Typically, that is
the biggest lever
6734.93 in terms of lean body mass.
6736.13 Yes, protein distribution
may make a difference,
6738.515 but I'm trying to put
it in context so people
6740.39 don't feel like they need to go
out and eat four meals a day.
6743.85 But again, so what I would say
is like some of the more milder
6746.9 forms of time-restricted
eating appear
6749.15 to be fine for lean
body mass, now,
6752.195 the caveat is the following.
6755.5 One of the nice things
about animal studies
6758.02 is when you
consider-- if you want
6760.3 to have a high subject
number, high level of control
6764.69 in a long duration, it's
pretty much your only option.
6768.41 So in our research
review reps, I
6772.46 created a Venn diagram,
which basically
6774.47 is like three circles
crossing over.
6777.77 One is study duration,
one is level of control,
6783.11 and the other one
is subject number.
6785.45 And to get all three of
those circles to cross over,
6788.6 it almost has to be an animal's.
6790.265 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
6791.825 And REPS, it's a
newsletter or a book?
6794.06 LAYNE NORTON: So it's our
monthly research review.
6796.76 So every month we review like
five studies that come out
6801.02 in fitness and nutrition.
6802.88 We'll usually do at least
one nutrition, one training,
6805.79 and one supplement per month.
6807.302 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
We will put a link
6808.76 to where people can sign up.
6810.26 This is a sign up format?
6811.8 Great.
6812.3 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
6813.092 So it's a
subscription-based service.
6815.06 So basically, when-- people
might look at my study, well,
6821.527 why did you see difference
in muscle weights
6823.36 whereas some of these other
studies don't see a difference?
6826.78 I weighed out every
single meal for 11 weeks,
6830.41 and keep in mind that 11
weeks in a rodent's lifespan
6834.34 is a really long time.
6836.47 That's about an 1/8 of
their total lifespan.
6839.05 So is it that there's
no effect or is it
6843.58 that the effect is
relatively small
6846.43 and would take a really long
time and very high level
6849.82 of control to see in humans?
6852.46 I don't know.
6853.24 But I think what I would say
relatively confidently is
6857.73 if you're going to do like
a 16/8 intermittent fasting,
6860.7 you're probably fine.
6861.78 Especially-- and again,
what is the goal?
6865.14 Like if you're a
bodybuilder looking
6866.73 to be the most massive
person you possibly can
6869.64 or you're a football
player or you're
6871.995 in some field that having as
much lean body mass as possible
6876.36 is really important for
you, then I would say,
6878.678 well, you're not really
gaining a whole lot
6880.47 by doing some form of
time-restricted eating.
6882.24 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think most
of the people listening to this
6884.13 do not fall into that category.
6885.345 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
6885.72 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think most
people want to maintain or lose
6887.61 weight.
6888.24 They'd like to,
perhaps, add a bit of,
6890.7 quote unquote, shape or muscle
to specific areas of their body
6893.31 and lose body fat.
6894.277 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
6895.11 And I think your normal
forms of time-restricted,
6897.357 and you're probably
perfectly fine for that.
6899.19 And again, I don't want
somebody to think, well,
6902.04 I do alternate day
fasting, there's
6905.235 no point to me resisting
training because I'm
6907.11 going to lose muscle mass.
6908.22 No.
6908.72 No, no, no, no.
6909.78 You can still build
muscle doing that.
6911.515 You just might not
build as much muscle
6913.14 as you would if you were eating
in a more traditional format.
6915.61 But if that's something that
works for you and your goals,
6918.03 and especially, if it's fat loss
or controlling your calories,
6920.94 then again, it's about the
hierarchy of what's important.
6924.42 So to answer your question, I do
think that timing and frequency
6928.92 matters a little--
not so much frequency,
6930.84 but distribution more so.
6933.24 So I think the
distribution matters,
6934.74 but it's a much smaller
lever than just getting
6937.47 enough total protein in.
6939.03 And then as far as
animal versus plant,
6942.98 I used to be in the
camp of, there's
6945.17 no way somebody can
build as much muscle
6946.91 on a plant-based diet.
6948.05 And now, I think I've
come back to, you can,
6950.75 it just requires a
little bit more planning.
6953.0 And I don't want to say
always, but it's very difficult
6958.45 to do without an isolated
source of protein.
6961.132 So unless you're going to
supplement with an isolated
6963.34 plant source of protein,
it's very difficult
6965.41 to get enough without going
over on total calories
6968.95 because you can figure
that, especially,
6970.78 like take somebody who may
be calorically restricted,
6973.42 trying to get enough protein
from whole intact plant
6976.0 sources.
6976.52 So you've got a few different
things working against you.
6978.91 One, the sources of protein
you're consuming also
6981.7 have carbohydrate and/or fat.
6984.3 Two, it's a less bioavailable
form of protein, and three,
6987.76 it's a lower quality of protein
in terms of it has, typically,
6990.37 less leucine, less
branched amino acids,
6992.47 and less essential amino acids.
6994.59 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You answer
the question that I almost
6996.84 interrupted you
to ask, which was,
6998.257 does it boil down to
the leucine content?
7000.17 And it sounds like that
is one of the components.
7003.35 And that a lot of the
vegan and vegetarian
7006.02 sources of excellent protein,
that excellent protein
7010.04 vegetarian or vegan source
is co-packaged with calories
7014.06 from carbohydrates
and/or fat that
7015.59 make it hard to stay under
the caloric threshold.
7019.13 Whereas a steak is--
7020.21 I'm not-- and
obviously, people might
7021.8 want to avoid that
for ethical reasons.
7023.09 LAYNE NORTON: Sure.
7023.6 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that's
a different matter entirely.
7025.01 But a steak or a piece of
chicken or an egg is-- well,
7027.93 an egg has a yolk which
is, there's fat there.
7031.01 But is almost a pure
protein, fat source.
7034.183 There's no carbohydrate
along for the ride.
7036.23 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
7037.063 So I think what I would
say is that, you can do it.
7039.74 Takes a little more planning.
7041.24 And you're almost always-- if
you're a vegan, especially,
7044.867 you're going to be
better off like something
7046.7 with some isolated form
of protein or vegan
7050.06 form of protein.
7050.76 Now, this word gets
into people say, well,
7052.8 what about the
limiting amino acids
7054.45 and those sorts of things?
7056.18 It's a consideration.
7058.31 Some of the better
forms of vegan protein
7061.73 in terms of amino acid
content are like soy.
7065.06 Now, I hear everybody
screaming online
7067.67 about their testosterone levels.
7069.23 In terms of actual outcomes
and looking at testosterone,
7072.68 there was a recent meta
analysis looking at soy.
7075.92 And I think if it's your
only source of protein,
7080.03 then maybe the
dosage is high enough
7081.68 to cause some weird effects.
7084.042 But if you're just using it
like once or twice a day,
7086.25 it doesn't seem to have
an effect on testosterone
7088.292 or estrogen. So that can be
a decent source of protein,
7092.06 because it is a
complete protein source.
7094.58 It does have a PD cause of one,
which PD cause is basically
7098.15 a measure of protein
quality based on,
7103.25 does it provide enough
of all the amino acids
7106.29 so that none are limiting?
7107.55 And so soy is one of the only
vegan sources that does that.
7110.48 Interestingly, potato
protein isolate
7112.88 actually has a similar essential
amino acid content to whey.
7116.57 So isolated potato protein.
7117.78 It's just really hard to find.
7119.03 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
7119.705 LAYNE NORTON: I've
been trying to source--
7120.62 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But
vegans take note,
7121.49 vegetarians take note, because--
7123.11 or vegans rather, because
whey is vegetarian,
7125.93 and whey is a very high
quality protein as far as--
7128.752 LAYNE NORTON: Very
high quality proteins.
7130.46 And actually-- they're actually
creating whey now out of--
7134.96 I think it's--
7136.34 I may mischaracterize this.
7137.493 But I believe they're able to
produce it out of like yeast
7139.91 or something like that.
7140.84 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing.
7141.882 LAYNE NORTON: That--
so for vegans, now,
7143.63 this is a great
option because you
7145.22 can have whey that's
not animal-based
7147.98 that is going to be every bit
as good as an animal-based whey.
7151.37 So I think that's great.
7154.3 Getting to the leucine--
7156.07 let me go back, sorry.
7157.09 So another reason that using an
isolated protein can be helpful
7161.38 is because it's
more bioavailable
7164.44 as well when it's
been isolated out.
7166.36 When the protein bound up in
the actual plant material,
7169.96 it tends to be
less bioavailable.
7171.55 Now, cooking can help
increase the bioavailability
7174.97 because it breaks some of
those bonds and whatnot.
7177.07 But it still seems to be lower.
7179.75 And you don't-- it's
really interesting.
7182.57 There was a recent study where
they did a corn, wheat, and pea
7187.19 blend of protein versus whey.
7189.95 And basically, the
outcome was, 30 grams
7194.03 of each stimulated protein
synthesis to a similar degree.
7199.01 But the plasma amino acids
in the plant-based protein
7204.95 still did not get as
high as with whey.
7206.9 Now, it may be that that's
just-- it doesn't matter
7209.823 because once you get
to a certain level,
7211.49 you get all the benefits.
7213.737 But I still found it
interesting nonetheless
7215.57 that they didn't
quite get as high.
7219.3 The other thing to consider with
the vegan sources of protein
7222.39 is the leucine content.
7223.6 So one of the studies
we did was we looked
7226.05 at wheat, soy, egg, and whey.
7230.15 Isonitrogenous,
meaning we equated
7232.43 protein between the
groups, isocaloric,
7235.91 we equated calories.
7237.62 And we looked at muscle
protein synthesis.
7240.44 And I think this was-- the
meals were 15% of total energy
7244.73 from protein.
7245.352 So like your food guide
pyramid level of protein.
7250.25 And we saw that in the
wheat and soy group,
7253.28 they did not increase
muscle protein synthesis,
7255.44 but the egg and whey group
increased muscle protein
7258.23 synthesis.
7260.13 Now, what's really
interesting is we went back
7264.16 and we took wheat and added
free leucine to it to match
7268.03 the leucine content of whey and
the protein synthetic response
7271.18 was identical.
7272.6 So again, I don't like to
simplify things too much,
7276.52 but leucine appears to
really be driving this ship.
7281.68 And I'll never forget, Layman
called me into his office
7285.64 one day, and he would always do
these thought experiments of--
7289.66 he liked to think
about why something
7292.182 occurs the way it does.
7293.14 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Dangerous territory.
7294.28 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
7295.072 So he would say--
7296.31 one day, I'll never
forget, he said,
7297.81 Layne, why do you think the body
evolved to just sense leucine
7300.88 for muscle protein synthesis?
7302.83 And of course, I'm
like, I don't know, man.
7306.7 I just work here like.
7308.26 I'm just trying to get my PhD.
7311.05 And he said, well,
think about it.
7312.76 You would want something that
really wasn't extensively
7315.19 metabolized by
the gut and liver,
7316.96 because you would want to
show up in the blood in values
7319.99 that reflect what you just ate.
7322.0 Makes sense.
7323.14 And you would want it to
have passive diffusion
7325.833 across the muscle
cell because you
7327.25 want to be
concentration-dependent,
7328.91 which it is.
7330.095 So--
7330.595 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Get into
the tissues and cells
7332.86 that need it most.
7333.61 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
7334.443 So not having active transport,
but rather passive transport.
7337.963 So yeah, I thought that
was really interesting
7339.88 the way he broke that down.
7341.005 So few different options for
the vegan folks out there.
7345.26 You can use an isolated
source of protein.
7347.487 And again, like there's going
to be good options coming,
7349.82 because this plant-based
whey is going
7351.41 to be a great option for folks.
7354.98 You can add free leucine
to it, to whatever
7357.86 your source of protein is.
7359.18 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Just by
supplemented leucine powder.
7361.4 LAYNE NORTON: Now,
it tastes horrible.
7363.903 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
7364.82 I think I've heard that.
7365.82 Maybe I've even tried it.
7366.92 LAYNE NORTON: It's completely
non-polar, it does not not
7368.36 dissolve in anything
And it is gross.
7369.77 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can it
be put into capsules?
7370.63 LAYNE NORTON: It can
be put in the capsules.
7371.96 Yeah.
7372.14 So you could take a capsule.
7373.307 Like for example, if you're
eating your normal meal,
7376.49 you could just take a capsule
of like 1 gram of leucine.
7378.86 Is probably going to bump
you up enough that you're
7381.44 going to be good to go.
7383.88 And then there's
options like blends--
7387.62 especially, with corn.
7388.64 Corn is actually
very high in leucine.
7390.59 That's a percentage
of its protein.
7392.33 Now, you've got to remember
like, you go eat corn
7394.67 on the cob and you're getting
like 2 grams of total protein.
7397.17 So it's not that much leucine.
7398.42 But if you isolate out the
protein, put it into a powder,
7401.69 well, now, when you're getting
like 80%, 90% of the weight
7405.02 is now protein, corn
is actually about 12%
7407.66 leucine in terms of the protein.
7409.92 So a great source of leucine, it
is like almost frank deficient
7413.27 in some other amino acids.
7414.555 But you can blend it with a
few other sources of protein.
7416.93 Like you could blend
it with a soy, a pea,
7420.02 and you can create these
complementary blends
7422.69 that would actually have
quite a bit of leucine,
7424.69 but also some of the other
essential amino acids.
7426.732 So there are options out
there for plant-based folks.
7428.99 And I mean, we have
seen people who
7431.51 are plant-based build
impressive amounts of muscle.
7434.81 There's quite a few bodybuilders
that are plant-based.
7437.06 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And a lot of
the endurance athletes like it.
7439.602 And even though-- when
we talk about muscle,
7441.98 we think about muscle
building often.
7444.53 Performance in endurance sports.
7446.48 And also just performance
for the typical person
7448.88 who's doing some
cardiovascular training,
7450.65 hopefully, some
resistance training.
7452.15 Also and just living life.
7453.92 I mean, many more
people now, it seems
7456.05 are vegan or at least avoiding
meat, in particular red meat.
7459.83 I'm not one of those people.
7461.61 I limit the amount,
and I certainly
7463.34 focus on the quality
of what I eat.
7465.56 But I do eat red
meat, which brings me
7468.05 to a question about just
generally in terms of food
7473.81 choice, can we come up with
a relatively short summary
7479.27 of the following?
7480.2 Tell me if this
is correct or not.
7482.51 That most of us
should be focused on--
7486.02 for sake of health
span and lifespan,
7489.41 should be focused on ingesting
minimally non-processed
7494.33 and minimally processed foods.
7496.31 Maybe even cooking our own food.
7498.08 I realize that's heresy now.
7499.31 But ideally, we would
do some of that.
7501.02 And really trying to avoid
foods that are highly processed
7505.25 and have lots of sugar.
7506.51 And I'm using this as a
segue to get into a question
7509.0 that I really want
your answer to.
7511.16 I've been dying to ask you this,
which is if sugar intake is not
7516.62 actually going up as much as
people think it is, why are
7520.94 people getting so much fatter?
7523.55 So what do you think about
just a general statement
7527.54 that we should try and eat
foods that are low to no--
7532.34 minimally to not processed
for about 80% of our foods.
7535.76 Is that a reasonable number?
7537.02 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
7537.2 It's hard to actually get
completely unprocessed food
7539.87 because almost everything
goes through some form
7541.37 of processing.
7541.75 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I'm
thinking like anything
7543.667 that wouldn't survive long
without refrigeration--
7545.752 LAYNE NORTON: On shelf?
7546.71 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
7546.86 On a shelf, like an
apple or a banana.
7548.99 So like oatmeal, like
ground oats to me
7551.265 as long as there isn't
a bunch of other stuff
7553.14 and they would be
minimally processed.
7554.93 A steak is not really
processed, although it's
7556.91 cut off the animal, et cetera.
7558.74 So there's a few steps in there.
7560.6 But that's what I mean.
7562.568 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
7563.36 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
7563.72 LAYNE NORTON: And I think
everybody gets the gist.
7566.15 I'm probably a
little bit pedantic
7567.623 when it comes to this stuff.
7568.79 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
No, this is good.
7570.207 Actually, one of the
things I appreciate
7571.88 about you is something that
I get teased a lot by people
7574.52 close to me, which is the
caveats and the insistence
7577.85 on precision is really
important because especially
7580.67 with online
communications these days,
7583.25 it's like a runaway train.
7585.32 People will--
7587.33 LAYNE NORTON: It's too
easy to misinterpret
7589.16 what you're saying.
7589.66 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's very
easy to misinterpret it.
7590.9 And the misinterpretations
are often
7592.52 used to leverage whole new ideas
about what is and isn't true.
7595.55 Mostly about what is true.
7597.62 So I really
appreciate the nuance.
7599.66 And this is what a longform
podcast really allows us to do,
7602.435 is catch every curve, you know?
7604.85 LAYNE NORTON: So I would 100%
agree with what you said.
7607.88 That if you were going to
make a broad stroke, that
7611.12 trying to focus on
minimally processed foods
7613.25 is very important.
7614.96 The one caveat I would
say is, I think it's
7617.18 important to understand why.
7618.68 Because otherwise, people can
make this weird association
7621.17 that, if I eat any minimally--
or any processed food,
7624.68 it's going to kill me.
7625.85 Or like every time
I eat it, it's
7627.65 like I'm smoking a
cigarette and my health--
7629.96 my longevity is declining.
7632.83 Based on the studies we have,
it's mostly about the energy.
7636.96 That processed food just gets
people to spontaneously eat
7642.34 more.
7643.86 And Kevin Hall showed this
in his study that was very--
7647.613 I mean, he designed some
of the most elegant studies
7649.78 in nutrition.
7650.2 ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's great.
7651.367 LAYNE NORTON: And they,
basically, took people
7653.71 from a minimally
processed food diet,
7656.41 and then gave them access
to ultra processed foods.
7659.54 Very few instructions.
7660.91 Just eat to you feel satisfied.
7662.44 And they spontaneously
increased their calorie intake
7664.648 by 500 calories a day.
7666.16 I mean, that's massive.
7670.94 And we haven't quite
figured it out.
7672.53 People say, well, it's sugar.
7675.18 It doesn't appear to be sugar
in terms of just an isolation.
7679.04 Well, it's fats.
7679.845 Doesn't appear to be
fats in isolation.
7681.47 Well, it's the combination
of sugar and fat.
7684.1 Partly, well, it's
the combination
7685.84 of sugar, fat and salt. Partly.
7688.22 But there's some
kind of overall magic
7691.06 to the texture and
the mouthfeel and just
7693.43 the overall
palatability of stuff.
7695.043 Which is always
why I say, there's
7696.46 like right and wrong ways
to these different diets.
7698.32 Like, for example, like there's
the right way to do plant-based
7701.09 and then there's like what's
in some of these documentaries
7704.26 where they're eating like
plant-based mac and cheese.
7706.66 And again, I love a
good mac and cheese,
7708.73 but that should not form--
7710.735 that should not be
pitched as a healthy diet.
7712.61 just because it's "plant-based."
7714.79 Because I mean, you're eating
a highly processed food
7717.49 that's very palatable
and easy to overeat.
7719.94 Same thing for keto.
7720.87 You've now got like
keto ice creams
7722.49 and you've got keto cookies
and all these sorts of things.
7725.55 And I'm like, yeah, and
if you look at them,
7728.328 they actually have more
calories than the normal stuff.
7730.62 And I'm like, yeah,
this is completely
7732.57 missing the point here.
7733.62 Like you're actually
just taking yourself--
7735.99 the whole point of those
diets is the reason
7739.26 you tend to lose
weight is originally
7741.63 like good luck 10
years ago, doing a keto
7744.93 diet, eating processed food.
7747.42 Like you just couldn't
do it, really.
7750.27 Now, you can.
7751.943 But the problem
is, it's not going
7753.36 to work because you're
going to be still consuming
7755.443 too many calories, because
even though it's keto,
7758.027 what are they doing?
7758.86 Well, they're trying to
make it more palatable,
7760.2 they're trying to make
it better mouthfeel,
7761.992 which, I guess, if you're being
keto for the sake of being
7764.94 keto, great, but if you have
hopes of body composition
7768.51 modification, it's going to
really negatively impact.
7772.71 So yes, I think minimizing
the amount of processed foods
7776.1 you consume can be important.
7778.27 Now that being said, it
depends on the individual
7780.75 and their goals.
7781.62 If your goal is to, for example,
build muscle or maintain a high
7785.37 body weight for a
sport, for example,
7787.41 like an NFL offensive lineman
or something of that nature,
7790.83 or if you're--
7792.63 I worked with an NBA
team, they were kind of--
7796.48 I can't disclose anything,
but they were looking
7798.48 at drafting a certain player.
7801.66 And like for them, processed
foods may actually be a tool.
7807.27 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or a teenagers.
7808.66 We all want young people to
eat more healthily, I think.
7812.25 Develop great habits.
7813.27 But some of them, their
caloric needs are so high--
7815.42 LAYNE NORTON: So high.
7816.03 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --that if
they were eating what I eat,
7818.322 they're going to dissolve into--
7820.79 they'll just waste away.
7821.79 LAYNE NORTON: So I
describe this, again,
7823.568 with a financial example.
7824.61 It's like a budget.
7825.93 So if I make a million
dollars a year,
7829.32 for example, is it OK for me to
buy like a $100,000 sports car?
7834.61 Let's assume that
loans don't exist.
7836.43 Is it OK for me to buy
a $100,000 sports car
7839.64 if I still am able to pay my
mortgage and pay my utilities
7843.93 and take care of my
responsibilities--
7845.91 the things I should do.
7847.62 Is OK if I do that if it makes
me feel good and it's fun?
7850.377 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK by me.
7851.46 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
7851.76 It's fun.
7852.36 Like it fits in your budget.
7855.29 If I make 50 grand
a year, should I
7858.33 be going out and
buying a sports car?
7860.64 Probably not,
because I'm not going
7862.14 to be able to pay
my mortgage and all
7863.52 these other responsibilities.
7864.728 So your protein, your,
fiber your micronutrients.
7868.05 These are your responsibilities.
7869.73 But those become
much easier to hit
7871.47 when you have higher calories.
7872.88 So if you're eating
4,000 calories a day
7876.12 for whatever goal you
have, you're probably
7879.12 going to have some left
over and like good luck
7882.87 eating 4,000 calories from
minimally processed foods,
7886.68 quite frankly,
you'll be miserable
7888.21 because you're going
to have such gut feel
7890.64 that you're going to feel
like you can't even move.
7892.99 And so again, now,
it becomes OK,
7897.12 well, is there something
inherent to that food
7899.13 processing?
7899.88 Is there something
that we can pick out
7902.478 that we know, OK,
well, this is going
7904.02 to be a negative
effect on health,
7905.58 even like body
composition stuff aside.
7908.7 And I would say,
there's not really
7910.41 great evidence of that so far.
7912.12 And a great example
of that is sugar.
7914.85 I mean, I actually just
wrote a really long article
7918.3 on my website about why I
think sugar was not the root
7921.39 cause of the obesity epidemic.
7923.16 And you mentioned sugar
intake in the last 20 years
7925.35 has actually gone
down a little bit.
7926.85 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Alcohol intake,
well, if you look on the whole
7930.54 it, might have gone
up a little bit,
7932.04 but certain certainly
in the male sector,
7934.95 it's gone way down drinking.
7936.42 Used to be-- there
was a 5 o'clock.
7938.28 People were drinking all day.
7940.02 People are smoking a lot less.
7943.41 I think it's a real puzzle.
7944.58 I'd love to know what
your hypotheses are.
7947.407 LAYNE NORTON: Well,
smoking could actually
7947.94 be in opposition because
nicotine is actually
7949.82 an appetite suppressant.
7950.82 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Appetite
suppressant and also increases
7952.02 focus.
7952.52 The problem is it often
arrives in a delivery
7954.488 device that can kill you.
7955.53 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
7956.322 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But nicotine
itself is a powerful agent.
7959.02 It also can offset age-related
cognitive decline not entirely,
7962.91 but it makes the
brain work better.
7965.61 LAYNE NORTON: I've got a buddy
who doesn't like caffeine.
7968.97 And he just takes those
nicotine pouches and, basically,
7972.24 has one in almost
all day because he's
7973.988 like-- he has a very stressful
job and he's a high performer.
7976.53 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
7977.46 You have to be careful
how you deliver it,
7979.21 but there's a Nobel Prize
winning neuroscientist that
7982.38 will chew five or six
pieces of Nicorette an hour,
7985.54 which I do not recommend,
but when he quit smoking,
7988.42 he just simply couldn't
function as well.
7990.27 And he was the
one who pointed me
7991.645 to do the literature
on offsetting
7993.3 age-related cognitive decline.
7995.13 Even neuron maintenance,
and it's pretty interesting.
7997.71 LAYNE NORTON: Well, it's a
pretty impressive nootropic
8000.288 to be honest.
8003.163 Now, the first
thing to realize is
8004.58 when we're talking
about consumption data,
8007.39 this is based on actual
production, basically.
8011.11 They're assuming that,
OK, we're producing
8013.15 this amount of
these foods, so we
8014.56 can assume the consumption
is going to follow that.
8016.685 So it's not a
direct measurement.
8019.24 But it has been validated
in a few different studies.
8022.39 We know that oil
consumption has gone up.
8024.18 Like that that's, yeah.
8025.68 That's one of the big ones.
8027.57 And this forms the
crux of-- like,
8029.25 the seed oils are
like the root of--
8031.29 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
definitely the question
8032.07 that I'm going to ping you on.
8033.32 LAYNE NORTON: They're going
to come into your house
8035.46 and kick your dog and punch your
mom, and all kinds of stuff.
8039.7 And I'm happy to address those.
8043.59 So calories have still gone up.
8046.07 There's some people
who claim that they've
8047.82 gone-- they've plateaued.
8050.97 I think the data seems to
suggest that calorie intake is
8054.06 still increasing.
8055.32 And the other thing
to keep in mind
8057.63 is, even if it's
plateaued, it's still
8060.69 at a high enough level
that obesity is probably
8062.768 going to continue to
increase up to a point
8064.56 where it'll probably plateau
if calories have plateaued.
8066.893 ANDREW HUBERMAN: What
about energy output?
8068.67 Leaving aside NEAT, because
that sounds highly individual,
8071.31 I mean, people are--
8073.02 the people we know are
focusing on exercise.
8074.882 But there are a lot of folks
out there that don't exercise.
8077.34 LAYNE NORTON: And energy output
has gone down over the years.
8080.82 I mean, it's very
obvious when you
8082.56 look at how people
work now compared
8084.12 to even 30, 40 years ago.
8086.55 It's much different.
8087.59 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Less walking.
8088.84 Also, I learned recently
that kids in high school
8092.07 don't take PE class
in many schools.
8094.98 But we had to suit up
and run and suit up.
8097.29 And if you didn't bring
your change of clothes
8099.54 or you didn't wash them in
which case you'd be better off
8101.915 just not wearing them, nothing
like the smell of a boys locker
8104.58 room after a weekend,
I can still remember it
8107.34 and it's not pleasant.
8109.14 But you had to run and do your
pushups with everybody else
8112.29 or play volleyball in your
regular school day clothes.
8115.77 So my understanding is that,
physical education is not
8120.3 part of the basic
education any longer.
8122.302 LAYNE NORTON: It probably
depends on the state,
8124.26 but I know many states have
done away with it just because
8126.677 of budget cuts.
8127.51 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
activity is going down,
8128.55 caloric intake is going up.
8129.81 Maybe--
8130.125 LAYNE NORTON: Plateauing
a little bit, yeah.
8131.22 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--maybe plateauing.
8132.72 Is that sufficient to
explain the obesity epidemic?
8135.382 LAYNE NORTON: Based
on what I've seen,
8136.965 I think it's pretty sufficient.
8138.185 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So it
might not be that big
8139.23 of a mystery after all?
8140.43 LAYNE NORTON: No, I don't
think it's a big mystery.
8142.555 I think that people don't like
the concept of energy balance,
8148.67 and I think because
they insert judgment
8151.49 into it, which is, OK, if
you're gaining weight over time,
8156.35 at a fundamental level,
it means you are eating--
8159.38 you're consuming more energy
than you're expending.
8162.88 People insert the judgment,
which is, you're lazy,
8166.93 you're a sloth,
or whatever it is.
8170.03 And I think there's a
lot of people out there
8172.15 who actually think
that, I actually
8173.35 remember talking to
somebody who was like, well,
8174.61 I would never hire an
obese person for a job
8176.47 because it's just obvious
that they're lazy.
8178.51 And I just remember
going, are you serious?
8182.44 Like, there are
plenty of very, very
8184.57 smart high-achieving
people who are obese.
8187.12 And like it's not--
8188.44 this is what happens when you
just put people in buckets.
8191.23 People are much more
complicated than this.
8194.52 Yes.
8196.2 There is some personal
responsibility.
8198.18 But then when you look through
the data and you take--
8200.61 there was a study
done in obese women
8203.0 where they found that
women who were obese
8204.75 were 50% more likely to have
had some form of sexual assault
8208.5 trauma in their past.
8211.53 We know that people
from lower income areas
8214.23 are more prone to be obese.
8216.6 There's several people who have
a higher ACE score, I believe,
8220.629 which of measures like
traumatic childhood events.
8223.707 I believe, there was a
study showing they're
8225.54 more likely to be obese.
8226.75 So there's-- yes, it is an
energy imbalance problem,
8233.16 but just saying,
eat less, move more,
8236.129 that's like telling
broke people, well,
8238.049 just earn more money
than you spend.
8241.58 It's technically right,
but it's very unhelpful.
8245.12 What is more helpful is
to describe and implement
8248.87 the habits and
behaviors that will
8250.459 allow them to achieve that.
8253.25 So I realized we go
off track a little bit,
8255.83 but circling back to
sugar, circa 2005,
8262.75 I believe that sugar
was fattening and bad
8265.57 for your health independent
of any other variable.
8267.98 So independent risk factor.
8269.99 And again, I want to be very
clear about what independent
8272.799 means.
8273.61 Independent means independent
of all of the variables.
8277.28 This thing is bad for your
health and body composition.
8281.176 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So on its own,
independent of whether or not,
8283.99 for instance, it increases
hunger and appetite.
8286.554 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
8287.514 Or caloric intake.
8290.29 I was at a graduate
school mixer.
8292.389 And one of the
professors there was
8294.19 somebody who had done
research on high fructose corn
8296.95 syrup and fructose,
specifically, as well.
8299.65 And he was talking
to another professor
8302.049 and he had done this study in
rodents where he had fed like--
8307.459 I think it was like 60%
or 70% of their calories
8309.459 from fructose.
8310.33 And they saw some
really weird things
8312.37 happen in the liver
with lipogenesis
8314.225 and all this kind of stuff.
8315.35 And the other professor
is saying to him, yeah,
8317.868 it's pretty obvious
that high fructose corn
8319.66 syrup is fattening.
8321.219 And this professor who
had done this research
8323.35 said, yeah, because
it's people overeat.
8326.537 And he's like, don't
you think there's
8328.12 something inherent to it?
8329.54 And he said, no, I think
it's just calories.
8331.6 People are eating
too many calories.
8333.1 He's like, we did a proof of
concept looking at could we--
8336.7 like, try eating 70% of your
daily calories from fructose.
8339.7 You actually can't do it.
8341.23 High fructose, corn syrup
is only 55% fructose.
8344.5 So if you ate nothing but
high fructose, corn syrup,
8346.828 you would still not
get to this level
8348.37 that they fed in this study.
8351.53 So that got me kind of
like questioning my beliefs
8353.959 about it.
8354.459 So then I went through and I
said, OK, look, let's take out
8357.219 the epidemiology.
8358.51 Not that epidemiology
is useless,
8360.129 but people who eat
more sugar are also
8362.92 likely to eat more calories.
8364.34 So then I looked for the
randomized controlled trials
8367.0 where they match calories
and vary the amount of sugar.
8371.469 And it doesn't seem
to make a difference.
8373.75 At least from fat
loss or fat gain--
8375.645 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But
what about health?
8377.27 So for instance, if somebody--
8379.24 and I know somebody like this
who loves sweets, is thin,
8384.91 get some exercise, not a ton.
8387.07 But my concern is that,
a significant fraction
8390.34 of their calories are coming
from these sugary foods
8393.19 and therefore they're not
getting enough fiber--
8395.89 maybe protein, et cetera.
8397.63 LAYNE NORTON: So let's look
at epidemiology for a second,
8401.17 then I'll address
this more directly.
8403.45 When we look at
epidemiology, people
8405.16 who eat higher amounts of
sugar tend to be more obese,
8409.24 they tend to have worse
biomarkers of health.
8414.02 The people who eat fruit--
a lot of fruit sugar,
8416.48 don't have those
same associations.
8418.74 So why is that?
8419.7 Well, because fruit
has fiber with it.
8422.0 So I started to believe,
based on the data
8427.13 I was looking at, that
high sugar intake was not
8431.24 the problem per se.
8432.53 The problem was that high
sugary foods, typically,
8435.05 are very low in fiber.
8437.06 But if you're getting enough
fiber, is sugar a problem?
8441.87 So there was a classic
study by Surwit in 1997.
8445.022 I think it's still
the best studies
8446.48 of this day looking at this.
8447.81 And I know those people who
say, well, it was done in 1997.
8449.66 It has no relevance.
8450.493 You know, I know, if it's a
good study, it's a good study.
8453.05 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Some
studies are timeless.
8454.64 In fact, they have
greater relevance--
8455.82 LAYNE NORTON: You're not
going to go back and undo
8457.1 the discovery of DNA
because it was 60 years ago
8459.44 or whatever it is.
8460.19 ANDREW HUBERMAN: No.
8461.023 LAYNE NORTON: So they looked
at an 1,100-calorie diet,
8465.47 so low calorie diet.
8467.33 One group was eating over
110 grams of sugar a day,
8470.84 like sucrose.
8472.43 The other group was eating
about 10 grams of sugar per day.
8475.04 Calories, protein,
carbs, fats all matched.
8479.36 And they provided all the
meals to these participants.
8481.85 So very tightly controlled.
8483.23 And it was over six weeks.
8484.82 Both groups lost the exact
same amount of body fat.
8487.353 So it doesn't seem to matter
for body composition in terms
8489.77 of sugar per se.
8491.27 Then they also looked at
some biomarkers of health
8493.61 like blood lipids and blood
sugar and some other things.
8497.09 Again, there was no
real differences.
8499.91 The only difference was--
8501.74 so all their biomarkers
improved in both groups.
8504.56 The only real difference was
a small difference in LDL.
8508.11 So the group eating low sugar
had a better improvement
8511.16 slightly in LDL.
8513.237 But that's probably because
they were eating more fiber.
8515.57 And we know fiber can bind
to cholesterol and lower LDL
8519.26 cholesterol.
8520.35 So now, I want to caveat this.
8525.29 Sugar probably doesn't have
any positive health effects.
8528.57 So there's that.
8530.15 And nutrition is an exchange.
8531.897 If you're eating one
thing, you're not
8533.48 eating another thing, right?
8535.34 So but what I would
tell people is,
8538.46 focus probably less on
sugar, focus more on fiber.
8543.03 So if you're eating 30, 40,
50, 60 grams of fiber a day,
8549.17 but your sugar is,
80, 90 grams, I
8552.632 would not be that
worried about it,
8554.09 especially, if you're
controlling calories as well.
8557.44 What I would be worried
about is if you're
8559.19 eating just a decent
amount of calories
8562.49 and not getting enough
fiber and in general, right?
8565.91 And even in studies,
there's a few meta
8568.31 analyzes out now looking
at isoenergetic exchange
8571.58 of different carbohydrates
with sugar carbohydrates.
8574.79 So fructose and
glucose and sucrose.
8577.425 Now, why is this important?
8578.55 Well, again, if
you're not equate--
8580.61 when I say isoenergetic,
that means equal in energy,
8583.1 equal in calories.
8584.39 So basically, when they exchange
either sucrose or glucose
8588.8 or fructose for other
forms of carbohydrate,
8592.43 do they see differences in
these markers of health?
8595.94 Like HbA1c, fasting blood
glucose, blood lipids,
8602.51 with rare exceptions, and I
can't remember all the data
8605.6 points exactly.
8607.07 But the take home
is, doesn't really
8610.13 seem to make a difference?
8611.66 Now, for anybody out there,
straw man is my argument,
8614.81 I am not advocating
for sugar consumption.
8617.36 But I think it's
important for people
8619.37 to not create weird
associations in their minds
8621.62 because one of the things
I've observed, especially,
8623.787 in the fitness industry,
is when people feel
8626.15 like they can't eat something--
8628.52 it's one thing if you say, I
am choosing not to eat this
8631.88 just because I'm choosing to.
8634.012 But it's a very different
thing when you're purposely
8636.22 restricting because you
feel like something is bad.
8639.22 And this-- I mean, you
know the human brain is,
8642.7 in many ways, amazing and
in many ways, really dumb.
8646.54 So when you purposely try
to restrict something,
8649.69 what tends to happen is you're
more prone to binge on it.
8652.82 So people who will
try to-- well,
8655.24 I'm never going to eat
you know sugar again
8657.61 or I'm going to try
and limit sugar.
8659.83 And this isn't the
case for everybody.
8662.02 But they have actually
shown now in studies, people
8666.7 who are purposely restricting
a specific nutrient,
8670.74 they tend to crave
more of that nutrient.
8672.72 And if they do get exposed to
it, they're more likely to have
8676.11 what's called a disinhibition
reflex, which is basically
8678.54 a binge response.
8680.16 Because the thinking
goes, well, this is bad,
8683.305 and there's no context on
dosage making the poison.
8687.39 This is just bad in general.
8688.99 So if I have it, I've
already screwed up.
8691.38 I might as well just
have as much as I want.
8693.87 And I like Spencer Nadolsky's
comparison to this.
8697.17 That's like getting a flat and
then going out and slashing
8699.84 your other three tires
because you might as well.
8702.73 So I really--
8704.01 I try to come from that
perspective of, I've
8706.32 seen so many people
struggle with, maybe,
8709.29 not an eating disorder, but
disordered eating patterns
8712.56 because of these associations
they've made in their mind.
8716.23 And so that's why I'm so
pedantic and a stickler
8719.1 about saying, OK,
yes, it's a good idea
8721.08 to eat mentally
processed food and try
8724.17 to avoid processed foods.
8726.06 But not because processed
foods are bad per se,
8729.93 but what the outcome tends to
be from a lot of processed food
8734.07 consumption, which is
overconsuming calories and then
8736.32 therefore energy toxicity
negatively contributing
8739.465 to your health.
8740.09 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
8741.007 It seems like it, again,
returns to the potential
8744.84 for a positive, negative, or
neutral behavioral change.
8748.17 And perceptual change
of like craving of food
8751.08 all the time that you
can have is terrible.
8754.62 That's a terrible
state to be in.
8756.18 And this, I think, is a
perfect segue way for something
8759.36 that first brought
us together, which
8764.79 was this thing about
artificial sweeteners.
8766.83 And let me just, for the
record, be very clear.
8771.16 I have long ingested foods
with artificial sweeteners.
8774.87 So throughout graduate school,
I didn't have the best habits.
8779.13 They're healthier now
than they were back then.
8781.18 But I would drink a Diet
Coke or two per day.
8783.78 I still have the
occasional Diet Coke,
8785.97 I'm not completely
averse to drink something
8790.8 that has artificial sweetener.
8793.41 Although, I do avoid
sucralose for reasons
8795.54 that maybe I can get
into a little bit later.
8798.63 But a lot of the
things I consume
8800.55 contain stevia, which
is not artificial
8803.82 but it is a plant-based
non-caloric-- or low caloric
8806.49 sweetener.
8807.66 And I don't have a
problem with that.
8810.24 I became very interested in
artificial sweeteners because
8813.75 of the animal data
pointing to the idea
8816.78 that they may disrupt
the gut microbiome,
8819.54 and then disrupt the gut
microbiome, as you pointed out,
8822.0 is a very broad statement.
8823.26 We don't really
know the percentage
8825.09 of lactobacillus, exobacilius,
or whatever ilius in there--
8830.52 they all seem to end in ilius--
8832.89 is ideal.
8833.808 And in fact, a lot
of these companies
8835.35 that are having people
send in their stool samples
8837.87 for analysis of the microbiome.
8839.38 I mean, take note,
we don't really
8841.59 know what a healthy
microbiome looks like,
8843.54 but we know what an unhealthy
microbiome might look like.
8846.25 And it's one that doesn't have
a lot of diversity in there.
8848.82 So I was interested
in that, then
8850.555 there's the recent human study
which we should definitely
8852.93 get into.
8853.86 But I was mostly interested
in artificial sweeteners
8856.71 for the reason that there is
this food conditioning effect.
8861.733 And you see it in
animals and you see it
8863.4 in humans that if you ingest--
8866.07 well, coffee is a
really good example.
8867.81 Coffee doesn't actually
taste good folks,
8869.518 even though I like it.
8870.435 But when you taste coffee
for the first time,
8872.31 most people think it's
bitter and disgusting.
8874.44 Most, everybody,
like 95% of people
8876.682 say, this doesn't taste good.
8877.89 LAYNE NORTON: Wine,
beer are same thing.
8879.06 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
8879.3 But people have learned to
associate the state of being
8881.592 caffeinated, which most
people like in order
8883.77 to just feel normal,
right, caffeine
8885.93 is one of the few drugs we
ingest just to feel ourselves
8890.13 enough that soon--
8892.17 myself included,
really look forward to
8894.57 and enjoy a cup of coffee.
8896.31 So it's a powerful
example, in my opinion,
8899.11 of the food conditioning effect.
8900.448 So it's like a Pavlovian thing.
8901.74 Instead of
salivating, you crave.
8903.24 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
8904.315 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it did
seem that this study from Dana
8907.68 Small's lab, which admittedly
was a small no pun intended
8910.53 study itself, not
very many subjects,
8912.48 showed that if you ingested
artificial sweeteners along
8914.82 with food that contained
glucose, that you could maybe
8918.09 even get a heightened
glucose response just
8920.7 from the artificial
sweeteners after a while.
8923.16 You and I connected over
this study on social media.
8926.22 You pointed out that the
design, the study wasn't superb.
8930.075 There was co-consumption
of glucose,
8932.497 which made it complicated.
8933.58 We can go into that.
8934.69 But the reason I'm spouting
off all this context
8936.99 is, artificial sweeteners
are many things.
8939.055 So I'd like to talk
about their effects
8940.68 on blood sugar in
the acute sense
8943.71 and according to what we
might ingest them with
8946.65 and how they might be
changing blood sugar
8948.87 regulation at the level
of brain and/or body.
8951.42 And then the gut
microbiome data, I think,
8953.73 are interesting
enough to discuss.
8955.98 And I have changed my view
on artificial sweeteners
8959.49 based on what you've taught me.
8961.02 So this is a case
where I've completely
8962.73 changed my view,
which is that, now, I
8966.48 don't have any problem
with them whatsoever based
8969.21 on the current data, which is
not to say that I'm gulping
8972.82 down cup fulls of sucralose,
but I feel OK ingesting
8978.07 some stevia and some aspartame
and I'm not too worried
8981.55 about it.
8982.12 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
8982.912 So I think stepping
back from a broad view,
8990.08 we have to think about, again,
the hierarchy of importance.
8993.26 And what are you replacing with?
8995.75 So there is no situation
where it is not a net positive
9000.7 to take somebody who drinks
sugar sweetened beverages
9002.95 and have them drink
an artificially
9004.42 sweetened beverage.
9006.187 In the meta analysis, there was
actually a recent network meta
9008.77 analysis looking at markers
of adiposity, HbA1c,
9015.1 a bunch of different
health markers,
9016.6 and when you substitute,
we'll call it
9020.59 non-nutritive sweeteners,
and stevia is not artificial.
9023.8 But so when you substitute
NNS for the sugar-sweetened
9028.15 beverages, you see improvements
in a lot of different things.
9032.295 What was really interesting
about this network meta
9034.42 analysis was they also
looked at water substitution
9038.08 in place of
sugar-sweetened beverages.
9040.24 And the effect wasn't
as powerful as--
9042.628 and these are randomized
controlled trials.
9044.42 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So artificial
sweetener containing beverages
9046.99 are more beneficial--
9048.34 LAYNE NORTON: Were
better for adiposity--
9051.22 for improving adiposity, and
then in the health markers,
9054.82 it was kind of a wash.
9057.34 Water and non-nutritive
sweetener, beverages
9062.29 performed similar.
9063.172 But there were better than
sugar-sweetened beverages,
9065.38 obviously.
9066.88 So they then based on--
9071.28 a network meta
analysis is where you
9073.35 can compare to things that
didn't get compared directly.
9077.56 So there's not many studies
comparing NNS versus water
9080.58 directly.
9081.43 But if you have a
common comparator,
9083.37 so if you compare A to B
and B gets compared to C,
9085.95 you compare A to C based on
how they interacted with B.
9089.67 Butchering it a
little, bit but that's
9091.59 the crux of a network
meta analysis.
9093.91 So they looked at
NNS versus water
9098.28 and found that actually,
in NNS was slightly
9101.52 better for improving adiposity.
9103.308 ANDREW HUBERMAN: NNS, of course,
being non-nutritive sweeteners.
9105.975 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
9106.166 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
9107.083 LAYNE NORTON: So now, again,
if you like drinking water
9111.09 and you don't want to--
9112.08 I'm not trying to convince
anybody to do that.
9114.9 What that seems to
suggest is there
9117.06 is a little bit of an
appetite suppressant
9119.1 effect from these
artificial sweeteners
9121.26 or non-nutritive sweeteners.
9123.0 Now, this gets a little
bit more complicated
9125.19 because if these
were people drinking
9127.14 sugar-sweetened beverages,
maybe they've already
9128.67 developed a sweet taste
and try to go to water,
9130.628 it's too much of
a jump for them.
9132.017 And so going to having
something like intermediate
9134.1 is a little bit better.
9134.85 Like, there's a lot
wrapped up in this.
9136.32 But these are the randomized
controlled trials,
9138.25 which are a little bit more
tightly controlled, which
9140.458 I tend to default
to a little bit more
9142.29 than I do the epidemiology,
which epidemiology is just
9145.44 so messy, because sure,
non-nutritive sweetener
9148.71 consumption may be associated
with different things,
9151.08 but there's also a whole other
set of lifestyle and habits
9154.5 that are tied up in that.
9156.16 So I tend to hang my
hat a little bit more
9158.19 on the randomized
controlled trials.
9159.7 So understanding that.
9160.98 OK.
9162.45 Now, all things being
equal, understanding
9167.02 that this is a tool that
may help some people,
9169.6 and whenever I post about
non-nutritive sweeteners
9171.76 in the comments, there's
always one or two or three
9175.24 people who say, all I
did was cut out soda.
9178.39 And I drank diet soda
instead, and I lost 50 pounds.
9181.01 Or I lost 75 pounds.
9182.11 I even had 1%.
9182.86 I lost 100 pounds.
9183.64 That's the only thing I did.
9184.48 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
9184.93 LAYNE NORTON: I mean, that's a
pretty massive lever to pull.
9186.79 If you consider somebody who
might be having like, I mean,
9189.207 five or six Cokes a
day, I mean, we're
9193.198 talking a serious
amount of calories.
9194.74 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And that also means
9196.27 that by replacing it with
artificial sweetener-containing
9199.03 beverages, they did not
replace the soda with food.
9203.363 LAYNE NORTON: Correct.
9204.28 So now, let's talk about, right?
9207.73 This is where we can get
into the micro analysis,
9210.01 but is that obese person who
lost 100 pounds by doing that?
9215.07 Do I really care about,
maybe, a small alteration
9217.65 to their gut microbiome?
9218.97 No, because their gut microbiome
is actually much more healthy
9221.67 now by them having lost all
that excess adipose tissue.
9225.82 So again, the ranking of
what I'm worried about
9230.47 can change depending on
the specific situation.
9233.19 Now, let's take somebody like
me who's lean and doesn't really
9238.2 have any health problems
that I'm aware of.
9243.75 What about artificial
sweeteners for me?
9246.11 Well, for me, I got using them
because of bodybuilding contest
9250.64 prep, because it was
about the only appetite
9252.62 suppressant that worked for me.
9255.72 But do I think that
they are healthful?
9260.13 Probably not.
9262.02 Do I think they're unhealthy?
9265.0 I would say based
on the current data,
9266.92 I don't think that
they're unhealthy.
9269.2 Now, the information
on blood glucose.
9273.44 So there's-- some of the
problems with some of these
9276.43 meta analyzes or these
reviews is they lump all
9280.24 the non-nutritive sweeteners
together and then they may say,
9283.228 well, there's no effect on this
or there's an effect on this.
9285.77 Well, the problem is these
are different molecules
9288.73 and they can
interact differently.
9290.53 Aspartame, very clearly,
seems to have no effect
9293.38 on blood sugar or insulin.
9295.45 That has been repeatedly shown.
9300.13 Stevia doesn't appear
to have much effect.
9302.5 Saccharin and sucralose,
the jury is mixed.
9305.8 Now, there was the
study that we first
9307.81 connected on which, I
think, their primary outcome
9311.35 measure was actually they were
looking at the sweet taste.
9314.23 Like how it affected
sweet taste.
9316.48 So what they did was, the group
that was getting the sucralose
9322.18 was also paired
with maltodextrin.
9325.03 The control group
was getting sucrose,
9328.22 which is an appropriate
way to compare
9332.67 the sweet taste because
maltodextrin is not
9334.92 as sweet as sucrose.
9336.31 So when you're trying to
combine sucralose, which
9339.503 is already sweet, with
another form of carbohydrate,
9341.67 you'd want something less
sweet compared to your control.
9345.0 But for the outcome measure
of insulin and blood glucose,
9351.54 probably, not as
appropriate because we know
9353.97 maltodextrin has a much higher
glycemic index than sucrose.
9358.95 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So they
appropriately controlled
9361.71 for taste, but not for the
effect of the sweeteners.
9364.74 And I think that that
was a key component.
9367.44 And I think, yeah, the
part of that study that
9369.57 intrigued me actually was
in a talk version of that
9373.92 because that study drove
me to watch a talk that--
9376.8 and we'll get Dana Small on
the podcast at some point,
9379.72 hopefully-- was that they
had kids do this study.
9382.603 And they actually had
to cease the study
9384.27 because a couple of the
kids became prediabetic.
9386.31 I mean, it seemed like there
was something hazardous about--
9389.388 this was the Yale
School of Medicine.
9390.93 It's a good place.
9391.68 I mean, there's a
range everywhere.
9394.71 But it just seemed like there's
something about sweet taste
9398.58 that if taken to
the extreme might
9401.04 be able to impact blood sugar.
9403.65 This has impacted my behavior.
9408.39 And I try to avoid really
sweet things, unless they're
9413.58 exceptionally delicious or
the occasion calls for them
9415.98 because I do think
that it increases
9417.96 my craving for sweet things.
9419.64 LAYNE NORTON: Well, it might
not be necessarily a craving,
9422.4 but it just programs you.
9426.06 Your taste buds are
extremely adaptable.
9428.37 So take, for
example, Indian food.
9432.57 If you bring Indian
people over to America
9435.432 and have them eat
some of our food,
9436.89 they think it tastes extremely
bland because they're
9439.77 used to such spicy
food that unless they
9442.92 have a certain level of spice,
they can hardly even taste it.
9445.68 If you've ever done
a high-sodium diet
9447.63 and then gone to a low-sodium
diet, it feels very bland.
9451.155 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's
where I started from.
9453.03 LAYNE NORTON: But over time,
your taste buds adjust.
9456.72 So sweet is the same thing.
9458.04 If you're used to
eating a lot of sweet,
9460.42 you get desensitized to it.
9462.03 And then if you go to
something less sweet,
9464.4 it can taste-bland at first.
9467.94 Over time, it'll get better.
9470.94 So I think it's
one of those things
9472.5 that, again, it depends
on the situation.
9475.71 If somebody's obese
and they said, well,
9477.45 this is going to
help me eliminate
9479.58 sugar-sweetened
beverage, why would you
9481.687 want to take that
tool away from them?
9483.27 That's a great lever to pull.
9484.92 I mean, if somebody can
lose literally 100 pounds
9487.92 from just one change in
lifestyle that's not even
9490.71 really that inconvenient of
a change, that is powerful.
9496.12 But again, is it the most
healthy thing they could do?
9499.32 And I think that's what
tends to get asked.
9503.33 We don't know.
9505.09 Is it healthier than water?
9507.77 Probably not maybe
as healthy as it.
9511.37 Who knows?
9514.4 But I really make
all those caveats
9518.15 because you don't want to
have people who could use this
9521.84 as a tool to think, well, no,
I can't do this because it's
9524.54 actually bad for me.
9526.78 If it helps you lose
50 pounds or 75 pounds
9529.48 or whatever it is, trust me,
it's not bad for you, right?
9531.855 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, it does seem
9533.313 to increase your
satiety signals.
9534.793 What do you think about
the microbiome effects
9536.71 in this recent study?
9537.753 Because the recent
study, I think,
9539.17 had some nice features to it.
9540.76 And you've done a detailed
description of the study.
9544.262 So for those that want that--
9545.47 LAYNE NORTON: Is this the
two-week study or the 10-week?
9546.85 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
the two-week study.
9547.78 Yeah.
9548.28 And we will provide a link.
9549.79 You did an excellent video
on your YouTube channel
9552.49 that really parses each piece.
9553.84 But they compared the
various artificial sweeteners
9557.62 and looked at the glucose
response, looked at microbiome,
9561.098 a number of different measures.
9562.39 What was your general takeaway?
9563.74 And this was in
humans for, I think,
9565.75 the first time looking
at microbiome in humans
9568.09 due to artificial sweetener--
9569.47 LAYNE NORTON: There
are a few studies
9571.588 on the microbiome in humans
with artificial sweeteners.
9573.88 The first two that came out
showed pretty much no effect,
9577.142 but they were a little
bit shorter in duration.
9579.1 They were two to four weeks.
9580.267 And again, it depends on what
bacteria are getting measured.
9583.63 There's many different
kinds of bacteria,
9586.94 so they could just be measuring
one that didn't change.
9589.79 And then there was a
10-week study that came out
9591.79 that got a lot of press.
9593.77 And they showed--
9595.36 I think it was sucralose.
9597.22 I think.
9598.54 They showed an effect of
change on the gut microbiome.
9603.08 Now, what was
interesting is when
9605.17 I went into the
species that changed,
9607.96 the species that changed the
most compared to the control
9611.23 was a species called--
9613.325 I'm going to butcher
the name, but it's
9614.95 like Blautia coccoides,
I think it's called.
9616.96 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
must say for those
9618.502 that work on the microbiome,
it's so difficult to pronounce.
9621.73 I mean, you need a
nomenclature committee,
9623.98 and you need acronyms.
9625.09 I'm sorry.
9625.6 Just do it.
9626.29 LAYNE NORTON: [LAUGHS]
9627.01 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Enough already.
9628.343 You're killing us.
9629.093 LAYNE NORTON: We'll call it BC.
9630.385 We call it BC.
9631.06 ANDREW HUBERMAN: BC, thank you.
9631.51 We're going to start the
nomenclature committee
9633.07 without you if you
don't do it soon.
9634.84 LAYNE NORTON: So they noticed
that this went up by, like,
9638.65 three- to four-fold.
9639.61 So I kind of went down
the rabbit hole on this.
9642.02 So interestingly, that
particular species of bacteria
9645.49 is actually associated with
lower adiposity, better insulin
9648.79 sensitivity.
9649.72 And people who are obese
and children who are obese
9652.84 tend to have less of it.
9654.56 So I said, well,
based on that study,
9656.17 you can actually argue that
maybe sucralose actually
9658.78 improves the gut microbiome.
9660.227 Now, again, I'm not
making that claim.
9661.81 Because we have a hard
time understanding
9665.32 what a healthy microbiome
looks like already.
9669.47 This last study that came out,
my biggest take-home was I
9675.81 think it's safe to say that
some of these non-nutritive
9678.21 sweeteners are not
metabolically inert.
9680.91 There are some effects.
9682.98 Now, are those effects
good, bad, or neutral
9686.58 I think has yet to
be fully elucidated.
9689.28 Now, I focused more on the
blood-glucose responses
9694.47 in my analysis.
9695.98 So in that 10-week study, they
did oral-glucose tolerance
9700.02 test.
9701.1 And their conclusion I
didn't really feel like
9706.35 fit their data.
9707.65 So their conclusion
was that-- and again,
9709.83 I think it was sucralose--
9711.48 that it elevated blood glucose.
9716.41 [SIGHS] And this
is where statistics
9718.1 can get kind of tricky.
9719.67 So my take-home was the
area under the curve,
9724.058 the incremental area
under the curve, which
9725.85 is looking at basically
the entire glucose
9728.1 response, was not different
between the control
9730.92 and the sucralose group.
9732.3 To me, that's the
biggest take-home.
9734.31 There was one time
point at the end
9736.41 of the study in the sucralose
group, the 30-minute time
9739.08 point, that was statistically
significantly higher blood
9742.35 glucose than the control group.
9747.623 It's kind of one of
those things where I
9749.29 go, OK, it was one time point.
9751.9 It's statistically significant.
9753.63 But even then, we've seen
things be statistically
9756.03 significant that end
up being data artifacts
9757.95 because they're not reproduced.
9759.302 So I'm not saying that's
what's happening here.
9761.26 But again, the overall
area under the curve
9763.56 was not different.
9764.31 So to me, that was
the biggest take-home.
9766.018 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And papers,
we should probably mention,
9768.42 are published because
of effects, generally.
9772.5 [CHUCKLES] Lack of
effect, harder to publish.
9774.985 LAYNE NORTON: Null
hypothesis doesn't--
9776.61 it's actually really unfortunate
because a null hypothesis
9779.7 is just as useful data as
the non-null hypothesis.
9783.63 But you're right.
9784.5 There is a very strong
publication bias
9787.08 towards showing an
effect versus not.
9789.485 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, unless you
9790.86 can flip a field on its head
entirely by showing something
9794.31 did not happen, typically
the positive result out
9798.51 does the negative
result, positive meaning
9801.06 you see a result. And then
of course, it's one study.
9804.6 And--
9805.32 LAYNE NORTON: Yes.
9806.07 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --I think that,
as you talked about earlier,
9809.34 the center of mass of
data in a given field
9812.37 are probably the best basis for
what we should do in terms of--
9816.66 and so I'm not changing my
behavior around the intake
9819.81 of artificial sweeteners.
9822.06 I personally am still going to
consume stevia and aspartame
9824.97 in relatively small amounts.
9826.26 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
9827.052 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But
now I'm thinking, well,
9830.01 OK, if something
contains sucralose,
9831.51 I don't have to perhaps
actively avoid it.
9833.91 Whereas before I was.
9835.005 I was actively avoiding it.
9836.13 LAYNE NORTON: So the
new study I thought
9838.83 was very elegantly--
very involved.
9842.41 I mean, to be quite
frank, some of the animal
9844.98 stuff they did was
extremely impressive.
9847.587 So there was actually
two arms to the study.
9849.42 One was the human arm.
9850.2 One was the animal arm.
9851.158 I focused much more on
the human side of it.
9854.92 So basically, this
was a two-week study.
9856.92 And the really unique aspect
of this, which I think
9860.49 is both a strength
and a weakness,
9862.62 they had almost 1,400
people apply for this study.
9867.69 And they only had 120, I think,
that actually went into it.
9871.29 Because they did a very detailed
food analysis of these folks.
9875.363 All of these people
said that they
9876.78 avoided artificial sweeteners
or didn't consume them.
9880.05 And I think people don't realize
how ubiquitous sweeteners are.
9883.2 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Prior to the study,
9884.7 these people were like--
it was like jury selection.
9886.83 They'd never--
9887.31 LAYNE NORTON: Yes.
9887.55 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
like not ever hearing
9888.69 of the plaintiff
and the defendant.
9890.28 These are these mutant
people who have never
9892.443 had an artificial sweetener.
9893.61 LAYNE NORTON: Right,
so the strength is now
9896.58 you don't have a lot
of preexisting effects
9900.87 that may be clouding
what would actually
9903.12 happen when you add it in.
9904.23 For example, if you have
people who are already
9906.188 consuming artificial
sweeteners and then you
9909.3 have them consume
artificial sweeteners,
9911.64 the likelihood things are going
to change is pretty low, right?
9915.11 So I think that
that's a strength.
9916.89 It's also a weakness.
9918.5 And I want to be really
careful because I
9920.69 think people took my words
a little bit too far, which
9923.0 means I probably didn't do
a good job of being nuanced
9925.25 enough.
9927.23 There is the possibility
for a placebo effect here.
9929.58 So to me, if somebody has gone
through that much painstaking
9934.76 care to avoid
artificial sweeteners,
9937.01 it's likely they have
a preconceived notion
9938.87 that those are bad for
you, because they're
9941.36 difficult to avoid.
9943.082 Yes, it's possible if they're
eating a very minimally
9945.29 processed diet that they're
just not exposed to them.
9947.498 And that's very true, as well.
9949.77 But the other thing
that the researchers
9951.68 acknowledged was they weren't
able to blind the study.
9954.772 Because if you've never had an
artificial sweetener before,
9957.23 you're only used
to regular sugar
9959.18 and you have an artificial
sweetener, you know.
9961.38 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You taste it.
9962.645 LAYNE NORTON: You know.
9963.44 It's still sweet.
9964.16 But it's not the same sweet.
9965.12 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And there's
an interesting effect there,
9967.495 where a lot of people don't
like the taste of aspartame
9969.95 the first time.
9971.57 I actually quit drinking
diet soda for a while,
9974.75 thinking I should,
and then had one.
9976.94 It tasted really--
9978.39 I can only describe it as
kind of artificial, chemical.
9981.11 And then pretty soon,
it tasted great again.
9983.21 LAYNE NORTON: Yep.
9983.51 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so there
is some attenuation there.
9985.843 And whether or not
that's central,
9987.68 meaning within the brain,
or peripheral, I don't know.
9990.14 But very interesting.
9992.21 Well, I see you as playing
a critical role in defining
9997.43 what is and what
isn't, what still needs
9999.47 to be determined in
terms of this landscape
10001.96 and the entire landscape
really of nutrition.
10004.42 LAYNE NORTON: And that study did
change my opinion in terms of,
10007.15 OK, I think we can clearly say
now that these aren't neutral.
10012.37 Or sorry, that they're
not inert, right?
10014.953 That was the thought
process before, was well.
10016.87 They're not digested or
whatnot, so they must be inert.
10020.59 That doesn't appear
to be the case.
10023.78 But again, when we look at the
blood glucose data, there's--
10030.06 and I'm not saying
this is what happened.
10031.79 I want to be very clear.
10032.79 I'm not saying this
is what happened.
10034.332 I'm saying it's
possible this happened.
10037.6 And so this is why we need
more studies to verify.
10040.41 If these people had
a preconceived notion
10042.3 that artificial sweeteners
were bad for them,
10044.35 it's possible, knowing they're
ingesting artificial sweeteners
10047.7 that they could have had
a blood glucose response.
10050.1 Now, my pushback on my
own point there would be,
10054.84 then we should have expected to
see it in all the non-nutritive
10058.35 sweeteners, which they didn't.
10059.73 It was just in
sucralose and saccharin.
10061.62 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, it was kind
10061.95 of a graded effect, where
sucralose and saccharin showed
10064.5 the most dramatic change.
10066.075 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
10067.115 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And stevia and
a few of the others did not.
10070.92 LAYNE NORTON: And
the other issue
10072.67 I took with it-- maybe
it's a ticky-tack thing--
10074.67 was their primary
outcome measure
10077.1 was blood glucose, the
oral-glucose tolerance test.
10080.73 But they had people administer
their own oral-glucose
10082.938 tolerance tests, which
basically they gave them-- they
10085.188 said, OK, drink this drink.
10086.37 And they were wearing
continuous glucose monitors,
10088.453 which should have been fine.
10090.64 But again, to me--
10092.49 and I'm being ticky tacky.
10094.02 And again, I know all studies
are limited by funding.
10097.18 So I think overall,
this was a great study.
10099.75 But I would have
liked to have seen
10101.22 them monitor the
oral-glucose tolerance
10107.64 tests to administer it.
10108.84 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, and
what they did before or after.
10109.77 You want to know that
they didn't ingest this
10111.72 or did ingest that.
10112.75 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
10113.165 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
10113.58 LAYNE NORTON: Those two things.
10114.872 But one other caveat is
it was a two-week study.
10118.908 So we've got to be really
careful how much we interpret
10121.2 in this because it's
also possible that this
10123.93 is a transient effect, right?
10126.06 And maybe it goes
away over time.
10127.66 We don't know.
10129.29 But again, I think
we can clearly
10132.58 say it's not inert, right?
10135.34 Now, how much emphasis we put
on that, on a two-week study,
10140.47 I still will say, OK,
maybe if you're worried,
10145.79 don't consume sucralose.
10148.19 But if you're 100
pounds overweight
10152.6 and you want to use some
sucralose as a replacement
10155.93 to help you lose
weight, I would say,
10158.212 don't let this study
deter you from doing
10159.92 that because the
net effect is still
10161.84 going to be more positive than
you not losing the weight,
10165.6 right?
10166.1 So if it's a tool
that helps you, fine.
10168.32 But I do hold open the
idea that, well, there
10171.23 could be negative
effects from it, as well.
10173.82 But again, we're looking at,
what is the overall outcome?
10178.04 And then they examined some
of the different things
10182.42 that were increased with
these different sweeteners.
10185.87 And again, this word
gets messy because one
10188.482 of the things they
saw was a big increase
10190.19 in butyrate production from the
change in the gut microbiome
10193.61 presumably.
10194.692 Well, as we discussed
earlier, butyrate's
10196.4 actually associated
with positive outcomes
10198.653 in terms of insulin
sensitivity, inflammation,
10200.57 and some other things.
10202.26 So I want to be real cautious
before people say, well,
10204.597 if there's a change
in the microbiome,
10206.18 it must be a bad change.
10207.77 We don't know.
10209.1 It's possible.
10210.11 And again, if we have 10 more
studies come out and start
10213.59 to show this, then I will start
to shift my personal opinion
10217.34 of artificial sweeteners.
10218.462 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So in anticipation
10219.92 of sitting down
today, I did solicit
10223.01 for questions on social media.
10225.54 And one of the questions
that got a lot of upvotes,
10230.15 likes if you will,
was one that I think
10233.72 raises interesting questions
about short-term and long-term
10236.31 health.
10236.81 And it's the following.
10237.9 I think it's a common scenario.
10240.52 A number of people
want to know, what
10242.98 is the healthiest way to
approach a rapid weight loss?
10247.54 And here what I
think is happening
10249.04 is somebody has
an event coming up
10251.38 or they're just tired
of being the weight they
10255.22 are, carrying the amount
of adipose tissue they are.
10258.04 And they wanted to
know whether or not
10260.44 it is safe to,
for instance, lose
10264.13 three pounds a week for a
few weeks in anticipation
10267.1 of a wedding or some other
event and whether or not
10270.91 straight caloric restriction
and increasing activity
10274.09 is the best way
to approach that,
10276.16 with the understanding that
they may gain back a little
10278.53 afterwards.
10279.67 I think ideally they'd like
to maintain it afterwards.
10282.55 But what do you think
of that approach,
10285.73 cutting caloric intake
in half, for instance,
10290.05 and then also doubling
your physical output?
10293.57 LAYNE NORTON: So
it's interesting
10295.72 because you might
be surprised by what
10298.6 I'm going to say, which is the
research data actually tends
10301.72 to suggest that
people who are obese,
10303.97 who lose a lot
more weight early,
10306.85 are more likely to
keep it off, which
10310.22 seems a little bit
contradictory, right?
10312.11 Like, well, that doesn't
seem very sustainable.
10314.45 But again, you're
weighing competing things.
10316.728 So there's the
sustainability aspect.
10318.27 But then there's also-- buy-in
is huge for sustainability.
10322.43 So for a lot of overweight
or obese people,
10325.07 if they start a diet and they
don't see something quickly,
10328.88 they bail on it because
it's not working.
10331.55 Whereas if they see some
rapid results pretty quickly,
10334.25 they buy in even harder.
10336.47 And so I think that the
conversation, especially
10339.53 for if there's any coaches
or trainers out there,
10342.47 is just presenting that as the--
10346.015 one of my favorite lines
is there are no solutions.
10348.14 There's only trade-offs.
10349.73 I think Thomas Sowell said that.
10352.32 So you're having
a trade-off here.
10358.68 Yes, you're going
to lose fat faster.
10361.14 You might lose lean
mass a little bit
10362.85 faster too, which
can be a problem.
10364.9 But I will say, the more
adipose tissue you have,
10369.28 the more aggressively
you can diet
10371.07 without negative consequences.
10373.11 Somebody like me doing
a really aggressive diet
10375.54 is not going to be
good for my lean mass.
10377.61 One, I have a higher
lean mass than normal.
10380.22 Two, I have a lower
body fat than normal.
10382.77 As your body fat goes
down, the percentage
10386.55 of weight loss from
lean mass goes up.
10389.19 So people who are very
obese, because they
10393.42 have so much adipose
tissue to pull from,
10395.58 there's very little
reason for the body
10397.35 to metabolize lean tissue.
10399.43 Now, that being said, if you
go on a-- people misinterpret,
10404.58 like, well, I got an
in-body done or a DEXA done
10408.99 and I've lost 2
pounds of lean mass,
10411.75 and they've lost
20 pounds overall.
10414.0 Well, keep in mind, adipose
tissue itself is 13% lean mass.
10418.68 So there's actually
a protein component
10421.41 to-- the structural component
of the adipose tissue.
10423.63 And it does have some water.
10425.1 So it's about 87% lipid.
10426.81 But the other part is lean.
10429.15 So at minimum, you should expect
a 13% reduction in lean mass
10433.41 when you diet.
10434.46 And then when you consider like,
you lose body water overall,
10437.55 which registers as
lean mass, and you
10440.85 lose your splenic tissues
can shrink a little bit.
10443.88 So it's normal for the average
person to lose 25% or 30%
10449.37 of the weight that they
lose from "lean mass."
10452.34 But that doesn't mean
skeletal muscle tissue.
10455.65 And again, the more
adipose you have,
10458.41 the more aggressively
you can approach the diet
10461.07 without really negative
long-term consequences
10464.46 to lean mass or
your overall health.
10466.72 But balance that with, OK,
if I'm going to do this,
10470.095 I need to understand
that I'm not going
10471.72 to be dieting this way forever.
10473.64 I'm doing this to give myself
a boost at the beginning.
10476.1 And I have to be
OK at some point
10477.607 with transitioning
to something that's
10479.19 a little bit more sustainable.
10481.355 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Based
on what you just said,
10483.23 it reminds me of the satiety
signal effect of exercise
10487.55 you mentioned earlier,
that exercising
10489.17 can improve our sense of
when we've had enough to eat.
10494.13 I just want to briefly mention
that when Alia Crum was
10497.06 on the podcast, she
mentioned that they'd
10500.36 been doing a study that--
10501.62 I have to pair you two
and hear the conversation
10504.62 as a fly on the wall.
10505.55 Because what she
was telling me was
10507.17 that if people believe that a
food is nutritious for them,
10511.91 then eating less of it
registers as more satiating.
10516.35 Whereas if people view dieting
as a deprivation system,
10520.58 like, oh, dieting is
hard, and the food sucks,
10524.33 and it's terrible,
well, then they crave
10526.727 all sorts of other things.
10527.81 Whereas they actually
observe in their studies
10530.54 where people report reduced
craving if they are told,
10533.03 for instance, a chicken breast
and broccoli and some olive oil
10535.85 and rice is actually
quite nourishing.
10537.83 It's actually
really good for you.
10539.385 Then people eat that.
10540.26 And they feel like they've
actually eaten more.
10542.84 The satiety signaling goes up.
10544.65 So it's just a point
that Alia made.
10546.615 Those aren't my data.
10547.49 LAYNE NORTON: Satiety is
so impressive because even
10550.46 the rate at which
you eat and right
10552.62 down to the size of the plate
and the color of the plate,
10557.93 the contrast in color--
10559.235 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really?
10560.655 LAYNE NORTON: I can't
remember exactly.
10562.28 I think it's if the plate is
a similar color to the food,
10568.31 I think people eat more.
10570.17 Whereas if it's a bigger
contrast, they eat less.
10573.45 So even plate color can make a
difference on how much you eat.
10576.84 So again, human brain,
very amazing, but also
10579.26 very dumb in some ways, right?
10580.577 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
an optimized algorithm.
10582.41 LAYNE NORTON: I always
joke with people.
10584.27 I'm like, just look at
how stupid humans are.
10586.25 You put some water in front
of them, like the ocean,
10588.837 they're like, oh, yeah, I'll
pay 10 times more for this.
10591.17 [CHUCKLES] But we're
kind of wired that way.
10595.1 ANDREW HUBERMAN: The reward
signaling pathways in the brain
10599.48 run one chemical mainly,
dopamine-- there are others,
10604.11 of course--
10604.94 and very few algorithms.
10606.38 It's sort of like an--
10607.94 intermittent reinforcement
is one, random reinforcement.
10611.48 But in the end, there
aren't many algorithms.
10613.44 And we are probably not
optimized-- certainly
10614.99 not optimized for our
own health because people
10616.948 will eat themselves to death,
drug themselves to death,
10619.58 et cetera, simply because
something felt good
10621.71 at one point.
10622.85 It proves your point.
10623.725 LAYNE NORTON: Right.
10624.558 One of the things
I tell people--
10626.06 I said this on--
10628.01 for someone's podcast
was, interestingly,
10632.06 the dichotomy of
life is if you do
10634.46 what's easy in the short
term, your life will be hard.
10637.7 If you do what's hard
in the short term,
10639.65 your life will get easier.
10641.0 It's very strange.
10642.05 And actually, Ethan Suplee
had a great example of this.
10645.11 When he was over
500 pounds, he said,
10647.24 the amount of work I had to
do to construct my life that I
10651.71 could just live was
so much more work
10655.64 than just going to the gym
for a couple hours a day.
10659.69 He's like, the gym work is hard.
10661.73 He's like, but when I
look back at how much work
10664.34 I had to do to sustain that
lifestyle versus just going
10667.61 to the gym and
restricting calories,
10671.36 he's like, to maintain the
lifestyle of being 500 pounds
10674.75 was infinitely more
difficult than what I do now.
10678.48 And so again, great example.
10680.76 Short term-- hard.
10682.13 Going to the gym,
calorie restriction.
10684.41 Long term, life's easier.
10687.08 Just a really interesting
dichotomy I think about a lot.
10689.51 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it can't
be restated often enough.
10693.6 Seed oils.
10695.71 People want to ask
about seed oils.
10697.46 And for--
10697.96 LAYNE NORTON: Cut.
10698.19 [CHUCKLES]
10698.82 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And for those of you
10700.362 that are listening who are
wondering why we're chuckling
10702.85 already, I should mentioned
that both in the Twitter sphere
10706.64 and Instagram and online, there
are these very polarized views
10710.75 that probably aren't worth
focusing on for too long.
10713.09 But there are a number
of folks out there
10715.28 who are arguing that seed
oils are the source of all--
10719.21 the obesity epidemic--
10720.17 LAYNE NORTON: Everything.
10721.1 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--inflammation, et cetera--
10722.72 LAYNE NORTON: Illuminati.
10723.2 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --everything.
10724.68 And then there are those that
would argue just the opposite,
10728.09 that meat is the source of
all problems, et cetera.
10730.67 And I think we've, thanks to
your nuance and expertise,
10734.24 we've hopefully
appropriately framed things
10737.18 that it's never that
black and white.
10738.92 It's simply not.
10740.265 LAYNE NORTON: Rarely.
10741.14 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Rarely.
10743.24 I love olive oil.
10744.5 I realize that
doesn't fit exactly
10746.09 into the seed oil category.
10748.08 I love olive oil.
10749.3 I use it in moderation.
10750.92 I do also consume some butter
in moderation, et cetera.
10754.64 But are there any
data on seed oils?
10757.497 And here, a good
example I think would
10759.08 be canola oil, which comes from
the rape seed, that literally
10762.5 was renamed canola oil
because rape seed oil is not
10766.46 good marketing.
10767.22 LAYNE NORTON: No, no.
10768.095 [CHUCKLES] No, exactly.
10770.45 So the first thing
I'll say is seed oils
10775.7 have negatively contributed
to our overall health
10778.31 because people in the last 20,
30 years, what they have tended
10785.18 to add into their diet that does
increase the overall calorie
10787.97 load is oil, mostly
from seed oils.
10793.99 But when we look at 1-to-1
replacement with other fats--
10799.54 if you look at the
epidemiology, yeah, you
10802.57 can find some
epidemiology showing
10804.25 people who consume more seed
oil have more negative health
10806.89 outcomes.
10807.91 Problem is, again, tied up with
a multitude of other behaviors.
10812.17 And then you can
find mechanisms.
10813.88 And the idea is, well,
they're polyunsaturated,
10818.62 which means in the
fatty acid chain,
10821.23 there's multiple double bonds,
which those double bonds can
10824.47 be oxidized when they're exposed
to heat and some other things.
10829.43 And so the idea is, well, when
you cook with these things,
10832.15 they make it oxidized.
10835.81 And that's going to cause
inflammation in your body.
10839.24 So that's a plausible mechanism.
10842.81 So as always, I defer to the
human randomized controlled
10847.36 trials.
10848.69 And so what you tend to
find is when you substitute
10857.11 saturated fats for
polyunsaturated fats,
10860.42 it's either neutral or positive
in terms of the effects on--
10865.1 inflammation is
basically neutral.
10867.14 There's some studies that
show a positive effect
10869.99 of doing polyunsaturated fats.
10872.3 But it probably depends on the
individual polyunsaturated fat.
10875.6 And that's the
other thing that's
10877.73 difficult because
you're categorizing
10879.59 everything in this one bucket.
10880.94 And there are some differences
between individual fatty acids.
10885.2 Even with saturated fat--
10886.97 for example,
stearic acid doesn't
10889.19 tend to raise LDL cholesterol.
10891.35 Whereas saturated fat as a whole
tends to raise LDL cholesterol.
10894.95 But there are some
saturated fats that don't.
10898.37 So again, we're putting
things in buckets.
10900.74 And it's a little more
nuanced than that.
10902.99 Then if you look at the
effects of polyunsaturated fats
10909.5 on markers of
cardiovascular disease,
10912.56 again, tends to either be a
neutral or positive effect
10915.74 when you substitute saturated
fat for polyunsaturated fat.
10920.24 Now, if you want to get
into monounsaturated
10922.22 versus polyunsaturated, there's
quite a bit of disagreement
10926.87 between the studies.
10927.9 What I would say, based on the
human randomized controlled
10930.8 trials, is that
you're probably better
10934.4 off consuming monounsaturated
and polyunsaturated
10937.67 in place of saturated fat.
10939.56 But again, if the idea is,
well, that means polyunsaturated
10943.635 are good for me, so I'm just
going to dump a bunch of oil
10946.01 on everything and now
you're upping your calories,
10948.093 well, that's a negative
now because you
10950.09 have to deal with the bigger
problem of overall energy
10952.34 toxicity.
10953.63 So I'm not somebody who likes to
demonize individual nutrients.
10958.1 I just haven't seen
really compelling evidence
10960.5 that seed oils are the root
cause of the problems that
10964.34 are being suggested.
10965.57 And I think this is a good
example of whenever there's
10969.98 something that pops up
in the fitness industry,
10972.23 there's always
the opposite thing
10973.79 that pops up and is the
reactionary, extreme reaction
10978.38 to whatever this
thing was over here.
10980.318 And I think that's what we're
seeing with some of the seed
10982.735 oil stuff, is it's mostly
people who are trying to espouse
10987.44 the virtues of saturated fat.
10989.93 And listen, I think it's fine
to consume some saturated fat.
10994.16 But again, I think
limiting it to 7% to 10%
10999.8 of your daily calorie intake
is probably wise, again,
11003.34 based on all the consensus
of the evidence I've seen.
11010.35 And so once again, we're
struggling with this.
11012.65 OK, we've got this epidemiology
and these mechanisms
11015.32 that sound good.
11017.58 But then, what
actually happens when
11019.08 we do some human randomized
controlled trials?
11021.55 And so far, I just
haven't seen the evidence
11024.39 to suggest that seed oils
are independently bad
11029.43 for you, independent of
the calories they contain.
11032.72 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You said
the words, "overall energy
11035.4 toxicity."
11036.25 And I just want to
highlight that I
11037.71 think that's a fabulous term.
11040.68 I don't think enough
people think about
11042.6 that because they are primed,
or we are all primed, to think,
11046.38 OK, seed oils might be bad.
11048.66 Or artificial
sweeteners might be bad.
11050.31 Or this particular
component of blood work
11053.07 might represent
something good or bad,
11055.11 without taking into
account overall energy
11058.11 toxicity, the toxicity of
overconsuming calories, energy.
11063.54 And thank you for pointing out
that most of the data point
11068.73 to the fact that saturated
fat should make up
11071.88 about no more than 7% to 10%
of total daily caloric intake.
11076.14 Is there a lower-end threshold
that can be problematic?
11081.21 For instance, I've noticed that
my blood profiles, especially
11084.03 in terms of hormones,
improve when I'm getting
11087.33 sufficient saturated fat.
11089.13 Maybe I'm a mutant.
11090.3 But years ago,
because I'm a product
11092.58 of growing up in the '90s,
I tried a low-fat diet.
11095.07 It certainly crushed
my androgen levels.
11097.548 I started adding
some butter back in.
11099.09 And I was right back
in the sweet zone,
11102.3 where I wanted to be.
11103.47 So 7% to 10% of total daily
caloric intake, I'm guessing,
11107.97 is probably about what I do now.
11109.8 I'll have to check.
11110.85 But is there a danger to going
too low in saturated fats?
11114.45 LAYNE NORTON: So
again, no solutions,
11116.46 only trade-offs, right?
11117.72 What maximizes out
testosterone might not
11120.69 be the best thing for
longevity, and vice versa.
11124.225 I'm not making that
claim specifically.
11125.85 But I think it's important
to understand this
11127.26 that I think we
all have this idea
11128.677 that there's this one
iconic diet out there that
11132.48 is going to be the best
diet for building muscle
11135.3 and burning fat and preventing
cancer and heart disease.
11138.99 And the reality is, there's
overall healthy dietary
11142.05 patterns that we see that
are good for those things.
11145.39 But when we get
down into the weeds,
11147.21 there's probably some push
and pull here, as well.
11150.18 So when it comes
to saturated fat,
11156.28 there is some evidence that
if you're too low on it,
11159.61 that yes, you can have a
reduction in testosterone.
11161.89 Now, is that reduction in
testosterone, let's say 15%,
11165.49 20%, whatever it may be, is that
sufficient to actually cause
11168.85 loss of lean mass?
11170.207 That, we don't know.
11171.04 That's never been shown.
11173.08 Interestingly, I
just remembered this.
11175.42 There was one study that was
comparing polyunsaturated fat
11181.88 versus saturated fat.
11185.09 And they equated total fat.
11187.733 And one of the really
interesting things
11189.4 was the group getting
the polyunsaturated fat
11193.15 had more lean mass at
the end of the study
11195.34 compared to the group
getting saturated fat.
11197.48 Now, it's only one study.
11198.61 I've never seen this replicated.
11199.943 So this is a
situation where I say,
11204.505 I would like to find out
what the mechanism of that
11206.63 is because this
could just be random.
11210.33 But if that gets shown over
and over, what I might say
11214.34 is, OK, well, if
polyunsaturateds are somehow
11220.61 increasing lean mass compared
to saturated fat, who cares
11223.038 what happens with testosterone?
11224.33 Unless that reduction
in testosterone
11226.16 is causing some kind of
impotence for your life, right?
11230.99 So all that to say,
I don't really know.
11234.44 And by the way, that's
something, for those watching
11237.83 and listening, real experts,
every once in a while,
11240.16 you should hear them say the
following words "I don't know."
11242.66 [CHUCKLES]
11242.93 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.
11243.972 My graduate advisor was
exceptional at that.
11246.11 And she was brilliant, right?
11247.745 LAYNE NORTON: And then in
terms of cholesterol synthesis,
11251.03 you really need a very, very
small amount of saturated fat
11254.57 for LDL cholesterol synthesis.
11256.19 Your liver can synthesize--
the amount of LDL cholesterol,
11260.87 or cholesterol that
your body requires
11262.64 is so small in terms of just
living and being healthy.
11266.67 So I don't think you
need to worry about that.
11269.82 And from a cardiovascular
disease standpoint,
11272.247 there is some evidence that
even taking people who have,
11274.58 quote, unquote, "low
LDL" of 80 or 90
11277.85 and taking them down
to like 30 or 40,
11279.77 that there is still a
benefit for the risk
11284.09 of cardiovascular disease.
11285.78 So again, you're weighing
these two buckets.
11288.98 So what I say, if you're doing
7% and 10% from saturated fat,
11292.43 you're probably fine.
11294.653 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I received
a lot of questions about
11296.82 whether or not there
are female-specific diet
11300.09 and exercise protocols.
11301.47 And I realize this
is a vast landscape.
11303.81 But some of those
questions related
11306.18 to menopause and premenopause.
11308.73 And some related to
the menstrual cycle.
11310.44 Most related to variations
across the menstrual cycle.
11313.62 In terms of, let's just say diet
maintenance or subcaloric diet,
11322.11 are there any things
that you've observed?
11324.9 We'll talk a little bit later
about this wonderful app
11328.2 that you've produced,
this Carbon app which
11330.3 helps people manage
their energy intake
11332.94 and a number of other things.
11334.75 And so there, you have
a sort of a database,
11336.66 or at least an experience base.
11338.37 And then I'm guessing there
are probably also studies
11340.65 exploring male-versus-female
differences in terms
11343.23 of adherence and what
sorts of diets work.
11346.08 Are there any general themes
that one can extract from that?
11349.11 LAYNE NORTON: This is going to
be a really unpopular segment
11351.61 for the women.
11352.197 Doesn't seem to make
a big difference.
11353.78 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, actually, they
11354.66 may be relieved to hear
that because it makes
11356.79 sorting through the
information space
11358.692 and certainly the
information we've
11360.15 covered in this podcast
up until now simpler.
11362.13 It means that everything
isn't different for them.
11364.23 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah,
so if you look
11367.15 at the male-versus-female
studies' relation to diet,
11370.6 they seem to respond
in a similar way.
11372.7 Like, similar
calorie deficit seems
11375.37 to produce similar results.
11377.62 If you do low carb, high
carb, regardless, it
11381.58 seems to boil down to
the same principles.
11384.19 Now, training wise, we
do know that females,
11387.108 the muscle fibers adapt a little
bit differently to training.
11389.65 But without getting
too far into the weeds,
11393.01 it doesn't really
change the way you
11394.51 should train because for the
most part, building muscle,
11398.41 there's a lot of different
ways to build muscle.
11401.87 So we know that light
loads up to maybe 30 reps,
11407.39 as long as it's taken close
to failure, have basically
11411.122 the same effect on
building muscle,
11412.58 at least in the short term,
as heavy loads for low reps.
11417.23 It's mostly about
taking the muscle close
11419.45 to fatigue or failure.
11421.85 You don't have to go to
failure, but getting close,
11424.43 within a few reps.
11426.33 If you're between
one rep and 30 reps,
11429.18 if you're getting
close to failure,
11430.94 seem to produce similar results.
11433.44 So again, great.
11434.39 You can pick whichever form of
discomfort you prefer, right?
11441.21 When it comes to
female-specific training,
11444.51 again, females
actually-- this is
11446.33 one thing that a lot
of people don't know.
11448.08 They actually put on a
similar amount of lean mass
11452.64 as a percentage of their
starting lean mass as men.
11455.85 In fact, there's no
statistically significant
11457.83 difference in the amount
of lean mass they put on.
11459.96 Now, the absolute amount
of lean mass that's added
11462.212 will be greater for men because
they started with a greater
11464.67 amount of lean mass.
11465.87 But the relative
increase in lean mass
11467.97 is pretty much the same
from similar training.
11471.58 Now, females, there's some
differences in fiber types,
11476.26 that females tend to be a little
bit less fatiguable than men.
11479.44 They can go a little bit
harder a little bit longer.
11482.05 And there's also some
evidence that they
11483.94 recover a little bit better.
11485.47 But that also could be
simply due to the fact
11490.15 that they're not able
to use as heavy of loads
11493.87 to induce hypertrophy.
11496.66 So I kind of have this theory
that while as a percentage
11500.75 of your one rep max,
you can program things,
11503.14 I think absolute load matters.
11504.91 When you look at the
most elite power lifters,
11507.84 the super heavy weights aren't
squatting three or four times
11510.34 a week because they're
squatting 800, 900 pounds.
11515.417 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
They need to recover.
11517.0 LAYNE NORTON: I think that
there's an overall recovery
11519.07 effect there.
11519.617 Again, I have no
data to back this up.
11521.2 This is just my observation.
11523.197 But when you get into the
lighter weight classes--
11525.28 and this goes for
men, too-- you do
11527.05 see quite a few people
who do many training
11530.74 sessions at high
RPEs and seem to be
11533.71 able to recover from that.
11535.07 So I do think the absolute
load makes a difference.
11537.58 Now, when it comes
to menstrual cycle,
11541.66 this is one of those things
where I kind of tell people,
11544.75 do what you prefer.
11546.71 So there are some
people who have said,
11548.74 you should schedule
your training
11550.63 around your menstrual
cycle, which
11552.16 is whenever you're going
through your menstrual cycle,
11556.33 reduce the intensity.
11557.65 Reduce the volume because you're
not going to feel as good.
11561.04 You're not going
to train as well.
11562.61 What I would say is
just autoregulate that.
11564.76 If you go in and you're on
your period but you feel good
11567.88 and you're doing
well that day, then I
11569.72 don't think you necessarily
need to back it off.
11571.72 And there was one study that
kind of supported that notion.
11575.29 But if you go in and
you feel terrible
11577.33 and you feel like you could
use a reduction in intensity
11581.47 and volume, then it's totally
fine to autoregulate that.
11584.39 And when I say
autoregulation, autoregulation
11586.96 means you are regulating the
individual training session
11590.95 based on your performance.
11593.09 So I autoregulate insofar
as, I'm a super nerd.
11598.87 So I have a velocity device.
11600.97 So I can actually
attach it to the bar
11603.19 and see how fast the load moves.
11604.93 And I know at various
different warm-up weights what
11608.14 velocities I should be hitting.
11609.67 So if I hit my last warm-up
and my velocity is about 10%
11612.61 higher than usual, I
can be pretty confident
11615.3 that that's going to
be a good day for me.
11617.05 If it's lower, than I can
back it off a little bit.
11619.85 In fact, at Worlds, when I
hit my last deadlift warm-up,
11626.92 it was 30% faster than I
usually hit in the gym.
11628.972 And I turned and
looked at my coach
11630.43 and I said, yeah, we're
going to get this today.
11632.43 [CHUCKLES]
11633.64 So there's various forms
of ways to autoregulate.
11635.77 But again, women, if you're on
your period but you feel good,
11639.41 I don't think there's any
reason you need to back off.
11641.66 But if you're not feeling good,
then it's totally appropriate
11644.202 to back off.
11645.295 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Raw
versus cooked foods.
11647.41 People wanted to
know whether or not,
11650.02 for instance, eating
a raw apple versus--
11653.318 I don't know.
11653.86 Does anyone cook apples?
11655.6 People used to bake--
11656.527 baked apples was a
dessert when I was a kid.
11658.36 It was kind of the
letdown dessert.
11659.83 Sorry, Mom.
11660.55 That was not awesome unless it
had a scoop of ice cream in it.
11663.25 LAYNE NORTON: Or apple pie.
11663.58 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And even
then, maybe not awesome.
11665.74 But anyway, raw versus cooked.
11668.74 Obviously, if you
burn a piece of meat
11671.32 to the point where it's pure
charcoal, that's too much.
11673.78 And there is a small movement
surrounding eating raw meats.
11679.03 That's not something
I particularly enjoy.
11681.1 Frankly, sushi is the only
raw food I personally ingest.
11684.208 LAYNE NORTON: Same.
11685.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I am
very careful about the source,
11687.333 frankly--
11688.54 reputable places.
11691.15 Is there anything
real about this
11693.13 in terms of being
able to extract
11695.05 the amino acids, vitamins,
and minerals from the food
11697.81 raw versus cooked?
11698.71 LAYNE NORTON: It just
looks cool for Instagram.
11701.38 So when you cook foods, they
actually tend to become--
11705.28 in terms of
protein-containing foods,
11706.87 they tend to become more
digestible, not less.
11709.81 Eggs are this way.
11710.95 Meats are this way.
11712.63 People say, well, when you
heat protein, you denature it.
11717.22 And I think they hear
that word "denature,"
11719.38 and they think destroy.
11720.64 And that is not
what denature means.
11722.26 So proteins fold up into
3D dimensional structures,
11725.95 you know this of course, based
on their amino acid sequence.
11728.92 And there are specific
energies of those amino acids.
11731.92 When you heat
protein or add acid,
11735.28 it starts to unfold
that protein structure.
11741.56 That happens during
digestion anyway.
11743.75 So I always chuckle when--
11745.285 I've seen some
companies come out
11746.66 with "way that
you can cook with"
11748.89 that's not going to
destroy the amino acids.
11751.1 And I'm like, so you
mean regular way, right?
11754.04 So yeah, typically,
cooking actually
11758.54 makes amino acids more
bioavailable, not less.
11761.36 Now, I would stay away
from charring your meat
11765.86 because there is some
evidence that charring creates
11769.7 polyaromatic hydrocarbons,
which at least in animals,
11773.72 when they give those, they
appear to be carcinogenic.
11776.45 So if you do char
your meat by accident,
11778.67 I would just cut off
the charred portions.
11780.848 And then you should be fine.
11782.015 ANDREW HUBERMAN: The
char is delicious.
11783.77 LAYNE NORTON: [LAUGHS]
11784.76 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not if
it's charred too much.
11786.35 But there is something about
a charred crust on a meat.
11788.642 My dad's Argentine and likes
a good charred barbecue.
11790.85 LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah, yeah.
11792.059 ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about--
11793.46 people referred to them in their
questions as "carb blockers."
11796.243 But I think what
they're referring
11797.66 to are things like berberine and
some of the glucose scavengers.
11801.23 And one glucose scavenger I'd
love for you to comment on
11803.87 is this assertion that taking
a brisk walk after a meal,
11807.05 or maybe even a slow
walk after a meal,
11808.95 some movement can help downshift
the amount of circulating
11813.71 glucose in some way.
11815.01 I've heard that.
11817.22 Not a lot of people, but some
are starting to pay attention
11820.25 to this idea of taking
things like berberine
11822.17 or even metformin
can scavenge glucose.
11826.19 I personally can't
take berberine.
11828.158 If I take it, I get
massive headaches
11829.7 unless I've ingested tons
of sugar and carbohydrates.
11832.47 So I just don't
mess around with it.
11834.02 But I know there are a
number of people out there
11836.21 that want to know whether or
not these glucose scavengers can
11839.48 be useful.
11840.28 LAYNE NORTON: I think that is
really majoring in the minors,
11842.78 if I'm being honest.
11843.95 As far as the carb
blockers, there's
11845.57 some white kidney bean extract
and those sorts of things.
11848.78 They do block the digestion
of carbohydrates, some.
11853.73 So when I say "block,"
those watching or listening,
11859.25 metabolism is typically
not on and off switches.
11862.47 So when we say things like
"block" or "attenuate"
11865.19 or "inhibit,"
typically we're not
11868.633 talking about just a switch
on the wall that you press it,
11871.05 and everything turns off.
11872.13 We're talking about
a dimmer switch, OK?
11874.53 So it just changes the emphasis.
11877.59 But these carb
blockers can reduce
11880.41 the absorption of carbohydrate.
11881.79 Now, they don't seem to cause
weight loss when you just
11886.502 do it in a normal diet.
11887.46 Now, why is that?
11888.42 Well, all it does is once
those carbohydrates get
11892.65 to the large intestine and your
bacteria get a hold of them,
11896.37 they start fermenting them to
volatile fatty acids, which
11899.168 get reabsorbed into your liver.
11900.46 So you don't get the
increase in blood glucose.
11902.04 But you still get almost
all the calories from it.
11904.47 It's just in a different form.
11905.76 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I see.
11907.14 LAYNE NORTON: So carb blockers,
if they actually worked really
11910.2 well, I mean, if you block
something from being absorbed,
11913.68 your GI typically does not just
let undigested material sit
11917.22 in there.
11917.85 You get diarrhea.
11919.23 I mean, that would
be the outcome.
11921.27 It's also how I debunked the
whole 30 grams of protein
11924.42 at a meal, you can't
absorb any more than that.
11926.82 I'm like, if that was the
case, when you ate a steak,
11929.85 you would just start
having diarrhea
11932.22 every time you went over that
30-gram threshold, right?
11934.71 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
remember during college--
11935.94 so this would be early '90s--
11937.29 there was the Olestra craze.
11938.57 LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah.
11939.15 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
This idea of putting
11940.692 in a nondigestible thing
into things like potato chips
11945.03 so that it would clear
through the GI tract
11949.32 faster, not absorb
as many calories.
11952.44 This went nowhere, obviously.
11954.533 You don't hear
about this anymore.
11955.95 But it does raise an
interesting question
11957.658 related to energy balance,
which is gastric emptying time.
11962.28 And obviously, in the
landscape of eating disorders,
11965.94 in particular anorexia.
11969.12 Use and abuse of
laxatives is a way
11971.73 in which people will,
in an unhealthy way,
11974.07 try and control their weight.
11975.6 And there's a lot of
problems with that approach.
11977.865 LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah.
11978.823 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But what
about gastric emptying time?
11981.12 Is this one way that people
could control their energy
11986.64 balance in a healthy way?
11988.2 And where does fiber
come into play?
11991.77 LAYNE NORTON: Fiber tends
to improve GI transit
11994.02 time because it adds bulk.
11995.16 So your GI system
is basically a tube.
12001.49 And it has peristalsis, which
is wavelike contractions that
12004.7 moves the food down
through the tube.
12006.315 Well, if you have more bulk
to the food, like with fiber,
12008.69 you can move it through
a little bit better.
12010.523 Now, in the gastric, the
stomach specifically, fiber
12014.9 tends to delay gastric
emptying and slow it a bit,
12019.28 probably because it
congeals a little bit.
12022.79 Now, this gets into the
glycemic index argument, right?
12027.55 If you do low GI
foods, you'll have
12030.85 a slower release of glucose.
12033.4 It's a slower gastric
emptying time.
12035.95 Does that affect energy balance?
12037.99 And so there are
quite a few studies
12039.49 looking at low GI
versus high GI foods.
12042.998 In the studies where they
don't control calories,
12045.04 low GI tends to
outperform high GI.
12047.62 But when they control calories,
there's no difference.
12050.66 And so what I
think that suggests
12053.14 is low GI foods,
just by their nature,
12055.66 tend to be higher in fiber.
12057.25 And so I think it just kind of
comes back to the fiber issue.
12059.95 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
12061.13 I'd like to ask you about
supplements for a moment.
12063.82 It's an enormous landscape.
12065.26 But I believe there are a few
things that you believe in,
12069.13 meaning they exist.
12070.54 And there are decent data
to support their use.
12073.3 Maybe even some anecdotal data
based on your own experience,
12076.78 as long as we highlight it as
such, it could be interesting.
12079.57 I've heard you talk about
two in particular, one
12082.06 that I'm very familiar with,
which is creatine monohydrate.
12085.03 If you could share
your thoughts on that,
12087.46 not just for muscle building
but maybe any other purposes
12090.31 for it.
12091.21 And then the other one
is one that frankly I'm
12093.37 learning more about
all the time now,
12094.94 thanks to your prompt,
which is Rhodiola rosea--
12098.488 I think I pronounced
that correctly--
12100.03 and why that might
be interesting
12104.14 or of use to people.
12105.28 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah, so
touching on creatine,
12109.24 it is the most tested,
safe, and effective support
12113.75 supplement we have.
12114.67 I mean, there are thousands of
studies on creatine monohydrate
12118.21 now.
12118.9 And I would say
very clearly, too,
12122.35 if you're using any
other form of creatine,
12124.18 I think you're
wasting your money.
12126.16 Creatine hydrochloride
has some hype around it.
12130.48 Apparently, it's a
little more soluble.
12132.55 The claim is that you need less.
12134.658 But there's only a
couple of studies on it.
12136.45 And it's more expensive.
12137.802 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
creatine monohydrate
12139.51 is not particularly expensive.
12140.873 I realize people have
different budgets.
12142.54 But it's not a budget breaker.
12145.405 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah, it's gotten
more expensive because of COVID
12148.03 and supply chain issues.
12150.048 There's forms of creatine
that appear to be
12151.84 as good, like hydrochloride.
12154.09 But it's more expensive.
12156.05 And then things like
creatine ethyl ester
12158.2 has been shown to be worse
than creatine monohydrate.
12161.17 Buffered creatine
is as good or worse.
12164.56 And it's much more expensive.
12167.03 So I tell people, just
take creatine monohydrate.
12169.69 It is tried and true.
12170.93 It's been shown to saturate
the muscle cells 100%
12173.86 with phosphocreatine.
12175.06 And that's what you want.
12176.53 So creatine works through a
few different methodologies.
12179.75 One, through increasing
phosphocreatine content,
12182.02 which helps improve
exercise performance.
12184.73 It also appears to
improve recovery.
12189.37 And it increases
lean mass, a lot
12193.6 of which is through bringing
water into the muscle cells.
12197.65 But I mean, muscle
cells are mostly water.
12200.392 So when people say,
well, it's just
12201.85 water, that's what
muscle cells mostly are.
12206.08 And it also increases strength
and some other metrics.
12210.46 Now, it also has
been shown in studies
12213.4 that people tend to
get a decrease in body
12215.32 fat percentage.
12215.945 Now, that's probably
because they're getting
12217.778 an increase in lean mass.
12218.86 And so the relative
is a decrease
12220.6 in body fat percentage.
12221.778 But there are a few studies that
show a decrease in fat mass,
12224.32 as well.
12224.82 I don't think that
creatine is a fat burner.
12226.653 I think that people are
able to train harder, build
12229.0 more lean tissue.
12229.85 And so that's probably
having an effect on fat mass.
12232.732 Then they've actually
shown more recently
12234.44 some cognitive benefits
to creatine, which I find
12236.81 really interesting, as well.
12238.43 But the only knock on creatine
that anybody's been able
12240.872 to come up with-- because
they've debunked the kidney
12243.08 stuff; they've debunked
the liver study;
12245.15 there's no evidence that it
harms healthy kidney or liver--
12248.99 is hair loss.
12250.6 So what about hair loss?
12251.66 Because there was
one study in 2009
12254.0 that showed that
creatine increased DHT.
12258.05 But they didn't
really show an effect
12260.03 on any other sex hormone.
12262.05 So it's kind of strange.
12263.42 Like, you would think if
there was an increase in DHT,
12265.67 there would be something
else that changes, as well.
12270.18 And it's only one study.
12271.55 And again, didn't directly
measure hair loss.
12273.95 It measured DHT, which
we know is involved
12276.98 in the loss of the follicle.
12280.35 So what I would say is
that I am not convinced.
12282.89 It's only one study.
12284.0 Never been replicated
to my knowledge.
12285.755 And it was looking at
a mechanism rather than
12287.63 an outcome.
12289.64 So if you're somebody
who's prone to hair loss
12291.69 and you want to avoid creatine
because of that, I understand.
12294.56 But for most people, I
don't think it's something
12297.23 to worry about.
12297.95 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you
emphasize the classic loading
12300.8 of creatine, taking it
a bunch of times per day
12302.96 and then backing off?
12304.04 Or just taking it
consistently at the--
12306.02 I think 5 grams per day is the
typical dose that people take.
12310.61 LAYNE NORTON: So again, no
solutions, only trade-offs.
12314.0 You can load it.
12314.81 And you will saturate your
phosphocreatine stores faster,
12319.52 usually within a week.
12321.2 If you just take
5 grams per day,
12322.76 it'll take two,
three, four weeks.
12325.46 But you will get
to the same place.
12327.62 And you're probably
going to have
12329.72 a much lower risk of GI issues.
12333.83 Creatine can be a gut irritant.
12336.32 If it is for some folks, I
would recommend splitting it
12338.81 into multiple doses, so
maybe multiple 1- or 2-gram
12342.26 doses per day.
12344.472 And definitely don't load
it if you're somebody
12346.43 who has GI issues from it.
12348.95 As far as Rhodiola
rosea, the research
12352.84 is still in its infancy.
12353.84 I was just reading a
new systematic review
12356.0 that concluded that we need
more high-quality research.
12358.79 But the research
that is out there
12361.34 seems to suggest
that not only does it
12363.89 reduce physical fatigue.
12365.75 But also reduces the
perception of fatigue
12369.14 and may also enhance memory
and cognition, as well.
12373.82 And it's referred
to as an adaptogen.
12376.22 So I really like it.
12378.62 My anecdotal
experience is when I
12381.29 combine that with caffeine,
it tends to smooth out
12385.28 the effects of caffeine.
12386.66 It's a more pleasant experience.
12388.91 And there's also some evidence
that if you're coming off
12392.3 caffeine, that it can
reduce the negative side
12396.89 effects to caffeine
withdrawal, which, by the way,
12399.08 I didn't really believe
in that until I actually
12401.21 did a cold turkey--
12403.22 so before a meet, I will cut
out caffeine for seven days
12405.98 because you can basically
reset your caffeine
12408.17 tolerance in seven days.
12409.79 And two days in, I
mean, I'm groggy.
12412.55 I've got the headaches.
12414.08 Usually, I'll get body aches
that come up because caffeine
12416.87 is actually a mild analgesic.
12420.02 And yeah, so it was
very interesting to see-
12422.15 but I slept like a baby,
I'll tell you that.
12424.16 I slept like a baby.
12424.4 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
then you took caffeine
12425.21 prior to your event--
12426.487 LAYNE NORTON: To the meet.
12427.57 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So you really
want the maximum punch from it.
12429.77 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
12429.95 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's why you do that.
12430.43 LAYNE NORTON: Yeah.
12431.222 And like I said,
Rhodiola tends to--
12434.18 it doesn't eliminate
those negative effects.
12436.53 But it tends to dampen
them a little bit.
12438.54 So I really like it.
12439.91 Again, would like to
see more research on it.
12442.19 But there's a lot
more stuff coming out.
12444.5 Ashwagandha is another thing
that looks pretty promising.
12448.13 Seems to increase
testosterone modestly.
12450.35 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
12452.155 LAYNE NORTON: They've shown
increases in lean mass.
12454.28 I don't think the
increase in testosterone
12457.43 explains the increase
in lean mass.
12458.9 It's just not a big
enough increase.
12460.4 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could it
be the decrease in cortisol?
12462.35 People have talked about--
12463.25 LAYNE NORTON: It's possible.
12464.417 It does decrease
stress hormones.
12466.79 It also has been shown
to help with sleep.
12470.348 But I would like to see
more research looking at,
12472.39 mechanistically, how it's
increasing lean mass before I
12475.69 say conclusively that
this is the next creatine.
12478.435 There's more research
that needs to come out.
12480.31 And then there's some other
things that have an effect.
12484.21 Citrulline malate, there
was a new meta analysis that
12487.42 showed that
citrulline malate can
12489.34 reduce fatigue and increase,
I think, time to fatigue.
12493.15 And it may actually have
some small recovery benefits,
12496.06 as well.
12498.04 Different forms of
carnitine can actually
12500.142 have recovery benefits.
12501.1 And actually-- interesting-- I
think it's carnitine tartrate
12504.22 actually has been shown--
12505.798 Volek published a
study that actually
12507.34 showed that it increased
androgen-receptor density
12509.423 in muscle cells.
12510.1 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's interesting.
12511.6 L-carnitine and its
other forms are pretty--
12514.115 I think there's good
evidence that they
12515.74 can improve sperm and
egg health for people
12517.723 who are looking to conceive.
12518.89 LAYNE NORTON: Oh, interesting.
12519.37 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, there
are a surprising number
12521.537 of studies on this in humans.
12525.4 But yeah,
androgen-receptor density--
12527.35 and that's from
oral L-carnitine.
12529.437 People are taking capsules,
not injecting directly
12531.52 into the muscle, yeah.
12532.57 LAYNE NORTON: And then
you've got things obviously
12534.653 like the other most effective
supplement out there
12537.46 is probably caffeine.
12538.657 I mean, if you look at
the research studies,
12540.49 caffeine produces
very consistently
12542.53 improvements in performance.
12544.493 So that's another one.
12545.41 Some people don't like
the effect of caffeine.
12546.91 That's OK.
12547.39 But--
12547.78 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I wouldn't know
because I've never come off it.
12549.7 [CHUCKLES]
12550.2 LAYNE NORTON: Exactly, exactly.
12551.74 Well, interestingly,
they do show
12553.39 that the effect appears
to be consistent,
12556.48 that even if you're a
habitual caffeine user,
12559.93 you do still get a benefit
every time you take it.
12562.45 But like you said,
you're just used to it.
12566.41 So there's those things.
12568.09 Then you've got things
like beta alanine,
12570.55 which it's in our preworkout.
12575.13 Probably not super helpful
for most people for resistance
12580.44 training.
12581.11 It does seem to have some
benefits for high intensity.
12585.72 If you get out more than
45 seconds or 60 seconds
12588.96 of really hard
training, it does appear
12591.63 to help with delaying
fatigue for that.
12595.36 And then you've got
things like betaine,
12598.23 or also called
trimethylglycine, which
12600.84 there's some evidence it
can improve lean mass.
12603.84 There's some evidence that
it can improve power output.
12609.13 So there's a few
things out there.
12610.77 But most of the stuff
is not very good.
12613.17 So I think that those kinds
of supplements, very useful.
12619.8 But again, I would never tell
people they need supplements.
12622.32 Again, even something
like creatine
12624.78 is going to be a very
small effect compared
12627.78 to proper nutrition,
recovery, and hard training.
12632.1 One of the things--
12634.74 I was talking with Ben
Bruno the other day.
12636.57 And I said, you
know, some people
12639.0 will ask me like, how does
this person make progress?
12641.76 Because their programming
is not evidence-based?
12644.55 Or this guy, his
exercises are dumb.
12647.94 And I'll say, yeah, but
they trained really hard
12650.52 for 20 years.
12652.35 One commonality you see between
really successful athletes
12655.74 or bodybuilders is
they train really hard.
12659.32 And one of the things
I have observed
12661.11 is the more into the
weeds people tend to get--
12664.08 and again, this is just my
own anecdote and observation--
12666.9 the more in the weeds they
tend to get, the less hard
12669.63 I see them train.
12670.95 And so one of the
things I really
12673.14 like that Mike Israetel
said, who's got a PhD
12676.62 and is a bodybuilder
himself, he said,
12679.62 you can't outscience
hard training,
12683.19 that if you're looking
to build muscle
12684.773 and you're looking to improve
your body composition,
12686.94 the main thing is just
doing the work over time.
12689.085 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Consistency
and the hard work.
12691.043 And I would add to that--
and this is true of academic
12693.78 endeavors, too, of course;
I hope you'll agree--
12697.418 LAYNE NORTON: Absolutely.
12698.46 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which is
that, yeah, the other thing is,
12701.633 given the mental
side-- earlier we
12703.05 were talking about how
satiety signals in the brain
12705.712 and what you think about
foods can be relevant.
12707.67 Learning to really enjoy
training hard in addition
12711.84 to learning to really
enjoy eating well,
12714.07 not just for the effects that
it has on body composition--
12718.2 those, too, of course.
12719.67 But just learning to really
enjoy the process of training
12723.0 hard and a really hard
workout or a really hard paper
12727.17 that you have to sort
through or really digging
12729.27 through a book
that's challenging,
12731.07 learning to really enjoy that, I
think, if there is a power tool
12734.7 out there, it's the
psychological end.
12736.53 LAYNE NORTON: And I
think a lot of that
12738.155 is getting the confidence
of doing something hard,
12742.38 that there's a
payoff at the end.
12745.83 I get asked a lot in my Q&As,
how do I get more confident?
12748.56 How do I become more confident?
12750.0 And I'll tell people,
you have to do.
12752.7 There's no hack.
12753.63 You can't read about it.
12754.26 You've got to get in the arena.
12755.552 And I don't mean like compete
in sports necessarily, but doing
12759.45 a PhD or doing something, just
something hard, where you're
12763.065 putting yourself out there.
12764.19 And you're saying,
this is my goal.
12765.648 And I'm going to go for it.
12767.35 You just learn so much by
doing that about yourself.
12771.79 And so just what you said, I
will reframe things in my mind
12776.6 when bad things happen from--
12778.85 it's not to say I never get
stressed out, because I do.
12781.25 And it's not to say that I
never get down, because I do,
12783.72 because I'm a human.
12784.83 But when something bad happens--
12786.44 I actually posted about
this in my story today.
12788.398 When something bad happens,
very rarely anymore do I go,
12792.2 woe is me.
12792.93 Why did this happen to me?
12794.013 Because you're in the universe.
12796.34 Random bad things
are going to happen.
12799.42 So instead, I say--
12802.41 if I'm not dead--
12803.85 instead, I say, well, what
an exciting opportunity
12807.48 to overcome an obstacle.
12809.41 And I bet, because in the
experience of my life,
12813.33 the biggest lessons and
the best things in my life
12816.33 have actually come out
of the most challenging,
12818.64 worst things that have happened.
12820.9 And so again, I
would never have been
12824.07 able to do these sorts of
things if I hadn't taken up
12827.133 weightlifting, because
weightlifting taught me
12829.05 so much about perseverance,
delayed gratification,
12833.28 overcoming obstacles.
12834.99 And that's why I love
it even to this day.
12838.122 And I'll still get
butterflies when
12839.58 I go in for a squat
session, even though I've
12841.62 been doing it for 23 years.
12842.79 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's wonderful.
12843.99 Well, it's clear that
you embrace hard things.
12846.03 And for people listening
to this, obviously
12848.19 it doesn't have to
be weightlifting--
12849.732 picking hard things,
learning an instrument,
12851.82 learning a language.
12853.71 Challenge is an
absolute builder.
12856.703 LAYNE NORTON: And
they've actually
12858.12 shown those sorts of things,
when you challenge yourself
12861.21 and also mentally, I think there
was a new study that came out
12864.367 basically showing a reduction
in the risk of Alzheimer's
12866.7 and other age-related
cognitive decline.
12869.14 I mean, basically, use
it or lose it, right?
12872.07 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, the desire
12875.64 and the will to persevere no
doubt translates to this thing
12880.77 that we call the
will to live, right?
12882.87 It's related to
the will to live.
12884.73 Well, I think that what
you just said beautifully
12889.41 embodies what most people are
aspiring to, which is to--
12892.5 I think most people actually
want to do hard things.
12895.72 They don't just want
to have the results.
12898.32 I think that most
people deep down
12900.27 have some understanding that
their reward system works
12902.94 that way.
12903.67 I must say, this
conversation for me
12905.52 has been tremendously rewarding.
12906.87 First of all, it
allowed me to meet you
12908.495 in person for the first time,
which I've really enjoyed.
12911.46 Certainly, this won't
be our last interaction
12914.01 on this podcast and elsewhere.
12916.62 Also, the amount of knowledge
that you contain inside you
12920.46 is astonishing.
12921.85 And--
12922.35 LAYNE NORTON: There's a lot of
stuff rattling around up there.
12923.94 [CHUCKLES]
12924.195 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And we all benefit
12925.41 because your ability to pull
from the mechanistic side,
12927.84 again I think not
limited to but related
12930.96 to your background in
biochemistry, all the way
12933.09 through to the impact in
humans, animal studies,
12936.868 being able to understand
where those sit relative
12938.91 to one another.
12939.6 And then you're
obviously a practitioner.
12942.09 You practice what you preach.
12943.53 And what you talk about
pertains to men, to women,
12947.94 younger people, older
people, people who are vegan,
12951.87 Keto, carnivore.
12953.13 You really are able to net
a tremendous number of ideas
12955.89 while staying really
nuanced and data driven.
12958.75 And so I just want to say
for myself and on behalf
12962.37 of the listeners,
really appreciate
12964.05 you coming in here today and
sharing with us your knowledge.
12966.84 We will absolutely point people
in the direction of where
12970.84 they can learn more about you.
12972.09 And one of the places
that I definitely
12975.33 want to mention before we part,
however, is this Carbon app.
12980.16 And I should just mention
this isn't a paid promotion
12982.59 or anything of that sort.
12983.632 Actually, one of our
podcast team members
12985.41 has been using Carbon
for a long time.
12987.45 This is an app that
you devised which
12989.61 allows people to navigate the
exercise, nutrition, and energy
12992.43 balance space for weight loss,
muscle gain, fat loss, weight
12995.82 maintenance.
12996.72 I would just like to
briefly ask you about that
12998.91 before we conclude.
13001.51 Without necessarily
telling us everything
13003.423 that's in the
Carbon app, I'd love
13004.84 to know, what are the
major things that it
13006.59 does and is good for?
13007.72 And then, what were
some of the key things
13010.33 that you wanted to
make sure were in there
13012.4 when you built it?
13013.65 What's the logical
backbone behind it?
13015.67 Because I think there
are a lot of food
13017.56 counting, calorie counting,
exercise apps out there.
13021.07 Everyone I've
talked to that uses
13022.54 Carbon, including
our mutual friend,
13025.63 Saagar Enjeti, this member
of my podcast, et cetera,
13028.06 raves about it.
13029.23 So what is Carbon?
13030.79 And what does it do?
13032.98 And what was your
mindset in building it?
13035.26 What did you really
want to see there
13037.87 that you didn't see elsewhere?
13039.463 LAYNE NORTON: So those
listening may not know,
13041.38 but I started online
coaching people for nutrition
13044.62 back in 2005.
13046.27 And that was the vast
majority of my business
13049.78 all the way up until 2017.
13052.45 And I had a lot of
success with that,
13054.58 whether it be just average
folks looking to lose weight
13058.27 or build muscle and
right up to elite level
13061.48 competitors in physique sport.
13063.97 So I had this idea, like--
13068.382 I don't want to
say I had the idea.
13069.84 A few people had the idea.
13072.14 What if we could take
what I do in coaching
13076.37 and try to automate as
much of that as possible?
13079.46 Because by the time I was
becoming a really popular
13082.4 coach, I mean, I was expensive.
13084.17 You were looking
at me charging--
13085.933 I got to the point where I
was charging about $1,000
13088.1 a month for coaching.
13089.3 And most people
cannot afford that.
13092.45 And I would like to not
just coach rich people.
13096.11 [CHUCKLES] You know what I mean?
13097.59 I would like to be able
to help other people.
13100.41 So the idea was to
create an app that
13103.043 could do some of this stuff.
13104.21 Now, there's always a place
for human interaction.
13107.46 But for people who
can't afford that,
13109.55 our app is basically
$10 a month.
13112.73 And basically, what we wanted
to do was set up an app where--
13118.64 think about if you went
to a nutrition coach.
13121.4 What would they do?
13122.79 They would probably ask you
some questions about your goals,
13125.9 take some anthropometrics,
maybe dietary preference.
13131.263 And they'd use that information
to kind of formulate
13133.43 a baseline plan.
13135.17 That's what Carbon does.
13137.18 So I think there's eight
questions in the signup
13139.61 flow about your activity,
your exercise, your lifestyle,
13145.59 your body weight, your
body fat percentage.
13148.11 And if you don't know it,
we help you calculate it.
13150.27 It's not perfect.
13150.99 But it's better than nothing.
13153.06 And then your
dietary preferences.
13154.79 And we use that to come
up with your baseline.
13157.88 And your baseline will be
your calories, your protein,
13160.41 your carbohydrates, and fats.
13161.99 And what's different
about our app--
13164.48 because apps like
MyFitnessPal or whatever
13167.15 will do that, as well.
13168.8 What's different
about ours is we
13171.53 encourage people to log their
weight daily for the reasons
13174.02 that we talked about earlier.
13176.028 And then you can also
track your food in the app.
13178.07 And honestly, I think our food
tracker is actually way easier
13181.58 to use than most
of them out there.
13183.92 What we typically get
great rave reviews
13186.05 about is how user-friendly
our interface is,
13189.02 that it makes intuitive sense.
13191.83 And so you track your food,
try to hit these macros
13195.66 that you're prescribed.
13197.39 And each week, you
will be prompted
13200.99 to check in with a coach
on your check-in day.
13203.3 And then you put in
some information.
13205.79 And then based on how
you're progressing,
13208.22 the app will adjust
or not adjust based
13212.627 on how you're progressing.
13213.71 So for example, if you're
hitting a weight-loss plateau,
13216.92 it will sense that.
13218.24 And it will reduce
your calories.
13220.28 Or if you're trying
to gain weight
13222.29 and you've hit a plateau,
it'll increase your calories.
13225.47 And there's a lot of
back-end algorithm
13227.87 stuff that takes care of this.
13229.232 But the fundamental
crux of the app
13230.69 is we try to determine
your total daily energy
13233.998 expenditure because
that's going to tell us
13235.79 the first big thing
we need to know,
13237.29 which is, how many calories
do you need to be eating
13240.05 for your goal, right?
13241.76 So on the front
end, we basically
13248.1 do our best guess based
on your anthropometrics.
13250.192 It's not going to be perfect.
13251.4 But it'll get us
in the ballpark.
13253.21 And if you do know, like
some people already know,
13255.712 well, I know what I
maintain my body weight on,
13257.67 there's actually a spot where
you can manually enter that
13259.89 during the signup flow.
13260.91 So that's helpful for people
who are super nerds like me.
13264.78 But then people will ask, well,
do you take Apple Watch data?
13269.952 Do you take this?
13270.66 Do you take that?
13271.368 And no, for the reasons
we talked about,
13273.09 that it overestimates
energy expenditure.
13274.92 What our app does is
it's an algebra equation.
13279.0 If you-- because
your body weight,
13281.85 your maintenance calories
is your total daily energy
13285.12 expenditure.
13285.66 Your average calories that
you eat to maintain your body
13288.48 weight will be the same as your
total daily energy expenditure.
13292.41 So if we know how body
weight is changing
13297.11 and we know how many calories
the person is consuming,
13299.82 we can actually solve for
what energy expenditure is.
13302.87 And you can see in
the app that we'll--
13305.09 there's a maintenance calorie
tracker, or energy expenditure
13308.21 tracker.
13308.9 And typically, after
about three to four weeks,
13311.97 even if the app
was off at first,
13314.3 it will have you pretty darn
close because, let's say
13318.32 somebody comes on.
13320.42 And their goal is to
lose a pound and a half
13323.78 a week or something like that.
13325.26 And the first week,
they lose 3 pounds.
13328.43 Now, the app actually
accounts for the fact
13330.415 that you can lose more
water weight the first week.
13332.54 So they probably wouldn't
get an adjustment.
13334.49 But let's say the next
week, they lose 3 pounds.
13337.13 The app will sense that and
adjust their calories up
13341.42 because it will be estimating
that their energy expenditures
13344.75 are actually higher
than what it previously
13347.57 estimated based on the amount
of weight they're losing.
13349.892 And the same thing
goes in reverse.
13351.35 If they're not losing
the amount of weight
13353.1 that they're supposed
to, it will lower them
13355.7 based on the fact that it may
have overestimated their energy
13358.28 expenditure.
13359.12 But that's the first crux of
it, is tracking that energy
13363.71 expenditure.
13364.64 And then the next
thing is protein.
13368.28 So when the back-end
algorithm stuff is happening,
13372.11 calories are set first
based on your energy
13374.3 expenditure and your goal.
13375.56 So for example, if you're
on an aggressive diet,
13379.55 your calories are going to
be lower even if your energy
13382.28 expenditure might be a
little bit high, just
13384.405 because if you're trying to
lose 2 pounds a week, I mean,
13386.78 you're going to be in a pretty
aggressive calorie deficit.
13389.7 So it's going to set
the calories first.
13391.44 Then, it will set protein
based on your lean body mass.
13395.35 Then, the calories
that are left over
13397.68 will be allotted to
carbohydrate and fat
13399.69 depending on your
dietary preference.
13401.34 And we have a few different
dietary preferences.
13403.34 There's balanced, which is about
50/50 to 60/40 carbohydrate
13409.26 to fat of the
remaining calories.
13411.33 Then you have low fat,
which is obviously a higher
13414.63 ratio of carbohydrates.
13415.89 You have low carb.
13417.96 You have a ketogenic diet,
which is very, very low carb.
13420.75 And then there's also
a plant-based option.
13423.36 And within each
of those options,
13426.12 still, you can go in and
actually shimmy the macros
13428.97 a little bit within
a certain range
13430.93 so that you can kind of dial
in what your specific dietary
13434.292 preference is
because, again, if we
13435.75 go back to what is going
to produce the best
13439.08 long-term results, it's whatever
the person can adhere to.
13442.3 So we really try to start
with the concept of adherence
13446.64 by allowing people to have the
dietary preference that they
13449.7 want.
13450.69 And there's some other apps
out there that are good apps.
13453.175 For example, we get
asked a lot, what's
13454.8 the difference between our
app and the Renaissance
13456.66 Periodization app?
13457.62 And they have a great app.
13459.42 But theirs is kind
of more rigid.
13460.925 And it'll say, you're going
to eat this many meals.
13463.05 And you're going to have
these foods at these times.
13465.42 So we're kind of the opposite.
13466.75 We want to give you
maximum flexibility.
13468.63 Now, for some people, they
would prefer the rigid structure
13471.39 at first.
13472.68 But we find that
for most people,
13474.91 giving them more flexibility
typically improves
13477.99 adherence over the long run.
13480.07 So that's kind of
how the app works.
13481.95 And again, there's
multiple different goals.
13484.247 It's not just a weight-loss app.
13485.58 There's a maintenance.
13486.91 There's muscle-building.
13489.19 So you've got all kinds
of different goals that
13491.34 can be accommodated, different
rates of each of those goals.
13494.74 And I mean, I've used the
app for over three years
13498.79 now to do my body weight.
13500.71 And I mean, when I say
that it's dialed me
13503.74 in-- because I'm very regimented
with logging and logging
13508.3 my weight.
13509.23 So what I targeted to
weigh in at Worlds,
13512.77 I got down to the 0.1 kilogram.
13516.183 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's fantastic.
13517.6 LAYNE NORTON: So it
was pretty cool to be
13519.308 able to use a tool that I helped
develop to actually coach me.
13524.59 So it's a great tool.
13526.66 We did some statistics.
13528.64 We polled 2,500 members.
13530.56 And one of the
questions we asked is,
13532.99 would you recommend
this to a friend?
13534.58 And 91% said yes.
13536.71 So I think our average
retention is, like,
13540.1 seven months, which for an
app that costs $10 a month
13542.5 is really great.
13543.167 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's great.
13544.417 Yeah, as I mentioned, a number
of people I know use it.
13547.01 This is not a paid promotion.
13549.43 But I think people need
guidance and tools.
13552.13 And what we know about the
human brain is that winging it
13555.34 can work, but that the brain
will cheat itself often.
13559.642 There's a Feynman
quote about this.
13561.1 And I'll get it wrong.
13562.017 It's always bad to try
and quote Feynman anyway
13564.82 because he said
it so much better.
13566.24 But that we are the easiest--
13568.14 it's easy to fool
ourselves basically,
13569.723 is what he was saying--
easiest to fool ourselves.
13571.807 LAYNE NORTON: Absolutely.
13573.16 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds great.
13574.41 We will put a link to it so
that people can check it out.
13577.48 Again, it sounds like a
wonderful tool and a tool that
13581.41 nets a lot of the
principles that
13583.69 sit as major themes for
weight loss, weight gain.
13589.63 I would assume directed
lean tissue gain is
13593.397 what most people are after,
and weight maintenance
13595.48 because a number of people
would like to just maintain.
13598.57 Listen, I really appreciate
your time and all
13601.39 that you're doing, certainly,
your time and energy
13604.57 and knowledge
today but also what
13606.01 you're doing on the various
social media channels.
13608.71 And just the fact that somebody
from the depths of academia
13613.72 is out there sharing
so much knowledge
13615.67 across so many
domains, you're a gem
13619.12 in this landscape
of nutrition and one
13621.79 that people really
need to hear from.
13624.82 So thank you so
much for your time.
13626.52 LAYNE NORTON: Thank you.
13627.52 I appreciate the opportunity.
13629.12 I really enjoyed it.

on many previous episodes
13670.75 of the Huberman Lab podcast,
we discuss supplements.
13673.45 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
13675.55 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them
13677.74 for things like sleep, hormone
augmentation, and focus.

supplements discussed
13682.48 on various episodes of
the Huberman Lab podcast,

in the precise ways that
13697.21 are discussed as optimal to
take for various outcomes
