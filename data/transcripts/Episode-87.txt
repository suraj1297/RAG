0.36 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.32 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.94 for everyday life.
9.09 I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor
11.01 of neurobiology and ophthalmology
12.96 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.12 Today, we're going to talk
all about hearing and balance
18.75 and how you can use your
ability to hear specific things
22.26 and your balance system in
order to learn anything faster.
27.03 The auditory system,
meaning the hearing system,
29.57 and your balance system, which is called
31.2 the vestibular system, interact
with all the other systems
35.56 of the brain and body and, used properly,
38.63 can allow you to learn
information more quickly,
41.05 remember that information
longer and with more ease
45.07 and you can also improve
the way you can hear.
47.84 You can improve your balance.
49.48 We're going to talk about
tools for all of that.
53.43 This is one area of science,
54.77 where we understand a lot about the cells
57.67 and the mechanisms in the ear
and in the brain and so forth.
60.88 So we're going to talk
about that a little bit,
62.51 and then we're going to get
directly into protocols,
65.71 meaning tools.
66.84 We're also going to talk about ways
69.42 in which the auditory and
balance system suffer.
71.94 We're going to talk about tinnitus,
73.17 which is this ringing of the ears that,
75.581 unfortunately, for people
that suffer from it,
78.47 they really suffer.
79.86 It's very intrusive for them.
81.58 We're going to talk about some treatments
83.25 that can work in some circumstances
85.8 and some of the more
recent emerging treatments
89.07 that I think many people aren't aware of.
91.68 We're also going to talk about this,
93.21 what seems like kind of a weird fact,
94.87 which is that 70% of people, all people,
98.84 make what are called
otoacoustic emissions,
102.02 their ears actually make noises.
103.55 Chances are your ears are
making noises right now,
106.81 but you can't perceive them.
108.46 And yet those can have an
influence on other people
111.58 and animals in your environment.
113.553 It's a fascinating aspect of your biology.
116.29 You're going to learn a
lot about how your biology
119.11 and brain and ears and
the so-called inner ear
121.98 that's associated with balance,
123.17 you're going to learn a lot
about how all those work,
125.53 you're going to learn
a lot of neuroscience.
127.47 I'll even tell you what
type of music to listen to.
130.02 And if you listen to me,
you can leverage that
131.93 in order to learn faster.
133.71 Before we begin talking about the science
135.6 of hearing and balance and tools
137.63 that leverage hearing and
balance for learning faster,
140.39 I want to provide some information
142.13 about another way to learn much faster.
145.437 There's a paper that
was published recently.
147.85 This is a paper that was published
149.6 in Cell Reports, an excellent journal.
152.43 It's a peer-reviewed paper
from a really excellent group,
156.53 looking at skill-learning.
159.78 Now, previously, I've talked about how,
162.88 in the attempt to learn
skills, the vital thing to do
167.92 is to get lots of repetitions.
170.61 You've heard of the 10,000 hours thing,
172.58 you've heard of lots
of different strategies
175.23 for learning faster,
80/20 rule and all that;
177.601 the bottom line is you need to generate
181.0 many, many repetitions of something
183.53 that you're trying to learn.
184.69 And the errors that you generate
186.53 are also very important for learning.
190.11 It also turns out that taking rest
193.837 within the learning
episode is very important.
196.56 I want to be really clear
what I'm referring to here.
198.969 In earlier episodes, I've
discussed how when you're trying
202.38 to learn something it's beneficial,
204.21 it's been shown in scientific studies,
206.054 that if you take a 20-minute shallow nap
211.11 or you simply do nothing
after a period of learning,
213.87 that it enhances the rates of learning
215.91 and the depth of learning,
your ability to learn
218.95 and remember that information.
220.85 What I'm about to describe are new data
223.16 that say that you actually
should be injecting rest
226.66 within the learning episode.
228.58 Now I'm not talking about
going to sleep while learning.
231.95 This is the way that the study was done:
234.38 the study involved, having
people learn sequences
238.25 of numbers or keys on a piano.
240.34 So let's use the keys on a piano example.
243.21 I'm not a musician, but I
think I'll get this correct.
248.41 They asked people to
practice a sequence of keys,
252.28 G-D-F-E-G; G-D-F-E-G; G-D-F-E-G.
257.04 And they would practice
that either continually
259.3 for a given amount of time,
or they would just do that
262.34 for 10 seconds, they would play G-D-F-E-G,
265.24 G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G,
G-D-F-E-G for 10 seconds.
268.44 And then they would take
a 10-second pause or rest.
271.81 They would just space take
a space or a period of time
275.51 where they do nothing for 10 seconds
277.12 then they would go back
to G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G.
280.49 So the two conditions, essentially,
284.74 were to have people practice continually,
286.78 lots of repetitions,
or to inject or insert
290.7 these periods of 10 seconds idle time
293.46 where they're not doing anything,
294.6 they're not looking at their phone,
295.88 they're not focusing on anything,
297.11 they're just letting their mind drift
299.06 wherever it wants to go
300.67 and they are not touching
the keys on the keyboard.
304.29 What they found was that
the rates of learning,
307.5 the skill acquisition and
the retention of the skill
310.33 was significantly faster
when they injected
312.81 these short periods of rest,
these 10-second rest periods.
316.29 And the rates of learning were,
319.44 when I say significantly faster,
321.26 were much, much faster.
322.81 I'll reveal what that
was in just a moment,
325.16 but you might ask why would this work?
328.5 Why would it be that injecting
these 10-second rest periods
331.05 would enhance rates of learning?
332.77 What they called them
was micro-offline gains
335.33 because they're taking their brain offline
336.817 from the learning task for a moment.
338.47 Well, turns out the brain
isn't going offline at all.
342.09 You've probably heard of the hippocampus,
343.51 the area of the brain involved
in memory and the neocortex,
346.53 the area of the brain that's involved
347.82 in processing sensory information.
350.38 Well, it turns out that during
these brief periods of rest,
353.54 these 10-second rest periods,
355.64 the hippocampus and the
cortex are active in ways
360.019 such that you get a 20 times
repeat of the G-D-F-E-G.
366.61 It's a temporal compression, as they say.
368.24 So basically, the rehearsal
continues while you rest,
372.51 but at 20 times the speed.
374.73 So if you were normally getting just,
376.336 let's just say five repetitions
378.97 of G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G,
G-D-F-E-G per 10 seconds.
383.13 Now you multiply that times 20.
385.12 In the rest periods, you've
practiced it 100 times.
387.76 Your brain has practiced it.
389.13 We know this because they
were doing brain imaging,
391.15 functional imaging of these people
392.93 with brain scanners while
they were doing this.
395.39 This is an absolutely staggering effect
398.96 and it's one that, believe it or not,
401.19 has been hypothesized or thought to exist
403.5 for a very long time.
408.43 This effect is called the spacing effect.
410.95 And it was actually first
proposed by Ebbington in 1885.
416.82 And since then, it's been demonstrated
418.87 for a huge number of different,
what they call domains,
421.38 in the cognitive domain.
422.41 So for learning languages,
in the physical domain,
425.19 so for learning skills that
involve a motor sequence.
428.57 It's been demonstrated for a huge number
430.75 of different categories of learning.
434.64 If you want to learn all
about the spacing effect
437.08 and the categories of
learning that it can impact,
439.51 there's a wonderful review article.
441.4 I'll provide a link to it.
443.2 The title of the review
article is parallels
446.05 between spacing effects during behavioral
448.25 and cellular learning.
449.14 What that review really does
450.25 is it ties the behavioral learning
451.707 and the improvement of skill
to the underlying changes
456.63 in neurons that can explain that learning.
459.53 I should mention that the
paper that I'm referring to,
462.0 the more recent paper that injects
463.78 these 10-second little
micro-offline gains,
467.92 rest periods is the work of the
laboratory of Leonard Cohen,
472.39 not the musician, Leonard Cohen.
474.32 He passed away, he was
not a neuroscientist;
476.36 a wonderful poet and musician,
but not a neuroscientist.
479.77 Again, the paper was
published in Cell Reports
481.45 and we will provide a link
to the full paper as well.
484.37 So the takeaway is if you're
trying to learn something,
488.25 you need to get those reps in,
489.69 but one way that you can get 20 times,
491.54 the number of reps in is by injecting
494.23 these little 10-second
periods of doing nothing.
498.02 Again, during those rest periods,
499.61 you really don't want to
attend to anything else,
501.93 as much as possible.
502.84 You could close your eyes if you want,
504.31 or you can just simply wait
505.63 and then get right back
into generating repetitions.
508.75 I find these papers that Cell
Reports and other journals
512.0 have been publishing
recently to be fascinating
514.21 because they're really
helping us understand
516.16 what are the best protocols
for learning anything.
519.11 And they really leverage
the fact that the brain
522.43 is willing to generate repetitions for us,
524.615 provided that we give it
the rest that it needs.
527.71 So inject rest throughout
the learning period.
529.81 And if you can, based
on the scientific data,
532.71 you would also want to
take a 20-minute nap
534.88 or a 20-minute decompress period
536.85 where you're not doing anything
after a period of learning.
540.13 I think those could both synergize
542.645 in order to enhance learning even further,
545.21 although that hasn't been looked at yet.
547.05 Before we begin talking
about hearing and balance,
549.59 I just want to mention that this podcast
551.32 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
554.3 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
556.54 to bring zero-cost to consumer information
558.56 about science and science related tools
560.91 to the general public.
562.57 In keeping with that theme,
I want to thank the sponsors
565.41 of today's podcast and make it clear
567.92 that we only work with sponsors
569.43 whose products we absolutely love,
571.36 and that we think you
will benefit from as well.
574.82 Our first sponsor is Roka.
576.89 Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses,
578.9 that, in my opinion are the
very highest quality available.
582.7 The company was founded by
two all-American swimmers
584.94 from Stanford and everything
about their eyeglasses
587.9 and sunglasses were created
with performance in mind.
592.46 These eyeglasses and sunglasses
have a number of features
595.13 that really make them unique.
596.27 First of all, they're
extremely lightweight,
598.12 the optical clarity of
the lenses is spectacular.
601.58 And for the sunglasses, they
have this really great feature,
604.3 which is as you move
in and out of shadows,
607.27 or across the day, the amount
of sunshine might change,
611.35 you always experience the
world as clear and bright,
614.4 and that can only come
from really understanding
616.89 how the visual system works.
618.63 The visual system has all these mechanisms
620.53 for adaptation and habituation.
622.69 You don't need to know
how those things work,
624.25 but the folks at Roka clearly do
626.23 because you put these glasses on
627.97 and you don't even notice that they're on.
630.07 They also stay on your face
even if you get sweaty.
632.42 They were designed to
be used while active,
634.77 so running and biking,
et cetera or indoors.
637.32 One thing that I really like
638.38 about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
640.58 is that the aesthetic is terrific.
642.39 Even though they were
designed for performance,
644.58 unlike a lot of sunglasses out there
647.02 that were designed for performance
648.33 that look kind of ridiculous,
kind of space-age,
650.97 Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses,
652.83 you could wear anywhere.
654.162 The aesthetic is really clean
656.22 and they have a huge
number of different styles
657.89 to select from.
659.24 If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses,
660.97 you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A, .com

672.66 Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
675.926 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
678.42 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
681.16 to help you better understand your body
682.77 and reach your health goals.
684.66 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
687.77 for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact
691.35 our immediate and long-term
health can only be analyzed
694.43 from a quality blood test.
696.0 And now with the advent of DNA tests,
698.27 we can get further insight and information
700.643 into how our metabolism is working,
703.8 how our brain is functioning,
how our endocrine system,
707.61 meaning our hormone system is functioning.
709.93 One of the issues with a lot of companies
711.62 and programs that involve
getting blood and DNA tests,
714.03 however, is that you get
the information back,
716.06 you don't know what to
do with that information.
717.65 With InsideTracker, they
make all of that very easy.
720.2 First of all, they can send someone
721.56 to your home to take
the samples, if you like
723.38 or you can go to a local clinic.
726.1 You get the information
back and, of course,
728.01 you get all the numbers and
levels of hormone factors,
729.941 metabolic factors, et cetera,
732.5 but the dashboard at
InsideTracker provides directives
735.84 so that if you want to
bring those numbers up
737.58 or bring them down, or
if you want to keep them
739.46 in the same range, it
points to specific regimens
742.32 related to nutrition, exercise,
and other lifestyle factors
746.5 so you can really move
around those numbers
748.22 to best suit your health
goals and health status.
751.5 If you want to try InsideTracker,
752.99 you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,
756.05 and you'll get 25% off any
of InsideTracker's plans.
759.05 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
761.3 Today's podcast is also
brought to us by Headspace.
764.17 Headspace is a meditation
app that's backed
766.02 by 25 published studies.
768.25 And in addition to those,
769.292 there are hundreds of studies showing
771.449 that meditation is
beneficial for our brain
774.89 and for our body.
776.37 One of the challenges, however,
777.93 is maintaining a meditation practice.
780.3 I started meditating a long time ago,
782.0 but I found it very hard to
keep that practice going.
785.08 Then I discovered the
Headspace meditation app
787.33 and what I found was that
because they have meditations
789.94 that are very short, as
well as some that are longer
792.12 and some that are much longer,
794.07 I could maintain my meditation practice.
795.67 Sometimes I do a short
five-minute meditation,
797.67 sometimes I do 20-minute meditation,
799.74 I try and meditate at
least 20 minutes per day,
802.77 but sometimes, some weeks, I
only do it five times a week
805.58 and I'll just meditate for longer.
807.2 So with Headspace, you
have the full palette
809.13 of meditations to select from.
811.16 If you want to try Headspace,
812.45 you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
815.65 And if you do that, you'll
get a free one-month trial
818.4 so no cost whatsoever,
820.24 with their full library of meditations.
821.98 So that's the best offer that they have.
823.732 So, again, if you want to try Headspace
826.24 and you want to get access to
all their meditations for free
829.31 go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
832.88 Can you hear me?
834.62 Can you hear me?
836.01 Okay, well, if you can
hear me, that's amazing
838.41 because what it means is that my voice
841.432 is causing little tiny
changes in the airwaves
844.94 wherever you happen to be.
846.75 And that your ears and whatever's
contained in those ears
850.5 and in your brain can
take those sound waves
853.75 and make sense of them.
854.9 And that is an absolutely fantastic
857.55 and staggering feat of
biology and yet we understand
861.08 a lot about how that process works.
863.74 So I'm going to teach it
to you now in simple terms
866.17 over the next few minutes.
868.14 So what we call ears
have a technical name.
871.94 That technical name is oracles,
874.7 but more often they're called pinna,
876.97 the pinnas, P-I-N-N-A, pinna.
880.39 And the pinnas of your ears,
883.02 this outer part that is
made of cartilage and stuff
887.07 is arranged such that it can capture sound
890.16 in the best way for your head size.
893.36 We're going to talk about ear size also,
895.03 'cause it turns out that
your ears change size
897.19 across the lifespan and
that how big your ears are
901.09 or rather how fast your
ears are changing size
905.14 is a pretty good indication
of how fast you're aging.
908.17 So we'll get to that in a few minutes,
909.51 but I want to talk about
these things that we call ears
912.87 and some of the stuff
contained within them
915.0 that allow us to hear.
916.68 So the shape of these ears that we have
920.55 is such that it amplifies
high-frequency sounds.
923.35 High frequency sounds,
as the name suggests,
925.44 is the squeakier stuff.
927.07 So low frequency sound, Costello
snoring in the background
930.11 that's a low frequency sound
or high frequency sound, okay?
934.81 So we have low frequency sounds
and high frequency sounds
936.6 and everything in between.
938.9 Now those sound waves
get captured by our ears.
941.91 And those sound waves, for those of you
944.29 that don't maybe fully
conceptualize sound waves,
947.62 are literally just fluctuations or shifts
952.01 in the way that air is
moving toward your ear
956.61 and through space.
957.443 In the same way that water can have waves,
959.355 air can have waves.
961.88 So it's reverberation of air.
966.12 Those come in through your ears
968.3 and you have what's called your eardrum.
970.84 And on the inside of your eardrum,
973.31 there's a little bony thing that shaped
975.45 like a little hammer.
976.49 So attached to that eardrum,
978.56 which can move back and forth like a drum,
980.327 it's a little membrane, you
got this hammer attached to it.
984.45 And that hammer has three parts.
986.35 For those of you that want to know,
987.34 those three parts are called
malleus, incus and stapes.
991.166 But basically, you can just
think about it as a hammer.
993.55 So you've got this
eardrum and then a hammer.
996.19 And then that hammer has
to hammer on something.
999.1 And what it does is it hammers
on a little coiled piece
1003.5 of tissue that we call the cochlea,
1005.76 sometimes called the cochlea,
1007.07 depending on where somebody
lives in the country.
1010.06 So, typically, in the
Midwest, on the East Coast,
1011.96 they call them coh-chleah.
1013.0 And on the West Coast, we call
them caw-cochlea, same thing.
1017.32 So this snail-shaped
structure in your inner ear
1021.28 is where sound gets converted
into electrical signals
1025.05 that the brain can understand.
1026.9 But I want to just bring your attention
1028.58 to that little hammer
because that little hammer
1030.92 is really, really cool.
1032.25 What it means is that sound
waves come in through your ears,
1034.46 that's what's happening right now,
1036.32 that eardrum that you have,
it's like the top of a drum.
1040.14 It's like a membrane, or
it can move back and forth.
1043.02 It's not super rigid and it
moves that little hammer.
1045.85 And then the hammer
goes, doom-doom-doom-doom
1047.83 and hits this coil-shaped thing
1051.11 that we're calling the cochlea.
1054.06 Now the cochlea, at one end,
is more rigid than the other.
1059.64 So one part can move really easily
1061.49 and the other part
doesn't move very easily.
1064.35 And that turns out to be very important
1066.64 for decoding or separating
sounds that are low frequency
1071.93 like Costello's snoring and sounds
1074.2 that are of high frequency,
like a shriek or a shrill.
1079.05 And that's because within
that little coil thing,
1083.88 we call the cochlea, you
have all these tiny little
1087.63 what are called hair cells.
1089.77 Now they look like hairs, but
they're not at all related
1092.37 to the hairs on your head
or elsewhere on your body.
1095.23 They're just shaped like hair,
so we call them hair cells.
1098.69 Those hair cells, if they move,
send signals into the brain
1103.712 that a particular sound
is in our environment.
1106.8 And if those hair cells don't move,
1108.64 it means that particular sound
is not in our environment.
1112.6 So just to give you the
mental picture of this,
1115.64 sound waves are coming in,
because there's stuff out there,
1119.25 making noises like my voice;
1120.96 it's changing the
patterns of air around you
1124.03 in very, very subtle ways;
1125.98 that information is getting
funneled into your ears
1128.97 because your pinnas are
shaped in a particular way.
1131.67 The eardrum then moves this little hammer
1134.18 and the hammer bangs on this
little snail-shaped thing.
1137.79 And because that snail-shaped
thing, at one end,
1141.02 is very rigid, it doesn't want to move
1142.81 and at the other end, it's very flexible,
1145.15 it can separate out high-frequency
and low-frequency sounds.
1149.66 And the fact that this
thing in your inner ear
1152.3 that we call the cochlea is coiled,
1154.48 is actually really important to understand
1157.119 because along its length,
1159.69 it varies in how rigid or flexible it is,
1162.3 I already mentioned that
before and at the base,
1166.3 it's very rigid and that's
where the hair cells,
1170.35 if they move, will make
high-frequency sounds,
1173.92 and at the top, what's called the apex,
1175.97 it's very flexible and
it's more like a bass drum.
1179.01 So basically what happens
is sound waves come
1181.273 into your ears and then
at one end of this thing
1185.15 that we call the cochlea, at the top,
1188.04 it's essentially encoding
or only responding
1192.13 to sounds that are like,
doom-doom-doom-doom.
1195.1 Whereas, at the bottom, it
responds to high-frequency sounds
1199.07 like a cymbal, [clanging].
1203.14 And everywhere in between,
we have other frequencies,
1206.89 medium frequencies.
1208.68 Now this should stagger your mind.
1211.7 If it doesn't already, it should.
1213.75 Because what this means is that everything
1216.92 that's happening around us,
1218.12 whether or not it's
music or voices or crying
1220.76 or screaming or screaming of
delight from small children
1224.74 who are excited, 'cause they're playing
1226.21 or 'cause they get cake;
1228.08 all of that is being broken
down into its component parts
1232.38 and then your brain is making
sense of what it means.
1236.13 These things that I've been talking about,
1237.99 like the pinna of your
ears and this little hammer
1240.74 and the cochlea, that's
all purely mechanical.
1243.77 It has no mind of its own.
1245.48 It's just breaking things
down into high frequencies,
1248.11 medium frequencies and low frequencies.
1250.11 And if you don't
understand sound frequency,
1251.88 it's really simple to understand,
1254.11 just imagine ripples on a pond.
1256.2 And if those ripples
are very close together,
1258.84 that's high frequency; they
occur at high frequency.
1261.99 If those ripples are further
apart, it's low frequency.
1265.4 And obviously, medium
frequency is in between.
1267.43 So just like you can have waves in water,
1269.048 you can have waves in air.
1270.17 So that's really how it works.
1272.39 Now we are all familiar with light
1276.73 and how, if you take a prism
and put it in front of light,
1280.29 it will split that light into
its different wavelengths,
1283.01 its different colors, red,
green, blue, et cetera.
1287.545 So like the Pink Floyd "Dark
Side of the Moon" album,
1289.81 I think, has a prism and
it's converting white light
1292.87 into all the colors, all the wavelengths
1295.79 that are contained in white light.
1297.61 Your cochlea, essentially,
acts as a prism.
1300.76 It takes all the sound in your environment
1303.03 and it splits up those sounds
into different frequencies.
1306.78 So you can think of the
cochlea of your ear,
1308.95 sort of like a prism
and then the brain takes
1311.64 that information and puts it back together
1313.72 and makes sense of it.
1315.13 So those hair cells in
each of your two cochlea,
1317.653 because you have two ears,
you also have two cochlea,
1321.38 send little wires, what we call axons
1324.91 that convey their patterns
of activity into the brain.
1329.61 And there are a number
of different stations
1332.23 within the brain that
information arrives at
1334.83 before it gets up to
the parts of your brain,
1337.15 where you are consciously aware.
1339.13 And because some of you
have asked for more names
1341.27 and nomenclature, I'll give that to you.
1342.64 If you don't want a lot of detailed names,
1345.18 you can just ignore what I'm about to say.
1346.77 But, basically, the
cochlea send information
1349.98 to what's called the spiral ganglion.
1353.13 A ganglion, by the way,
if you're going to learn
1355.14 any neuroscience, just know
that anytime you hear ganglion,
1358.0 a ganglion is just a clump, so
it means a bunch of neurons.
1361.93 So a clump of cells.
1363.62 So the spiral ganglion
is a bunch of neurons
1366.18 that the information then goes off
1368.05 to what are called the cochlear
nuclei in the brainstem.
1371.77 Brainstem is down near your neck,
1374.02 then up to a structure
that has a really cool name
1375.89 called the superior olive,
1377.27 because you have one on
each side of your brain.
1379.82 And if I were to bring
you to my lab and show you
1382.45 the superior olives in your
brain or anyone else's brain,
1385.55 they look like little olives,
1387.23 even that little divot in them that to me,
1389.128 it looks like a pimiento,
1390.66 but they just call them
the superior olive.
1393.32 And then the neurons
in the superior olive,
1395.57 then they send information up
1396.97 to what's called the inferior colliculus,
1398.72 only called inferior because it sits below
1400.88 a structure called the
superior colliculus.
1402.94 And then the information
goes up to what's called
1405.06 the medial geniculate nucleus.
1407.38 And then up to your neocortex
1408.93 where you make sense of it all.
1411.51 Now you don't have to remember all that,
1412.95 but you should know that
there are a lot of stations
1416.65 in which auditory information is processed
1419.14 before it gets up to
our conscious detection.
1423.6 And there is a good reason for that,
1425.9 which is that more important than knowing
1428.93 what you're hearing, you need to know
1431.5 where it's coming from.
1434.49 It's vital to our survival,
that if something, for instance,
1437.75 is falling toward us, that
we know if it's coming
1440.23 to our right side, if it's
going to hit us from behind,
1443.26 we have to know, for instance,
1444.3 if a car is coming at us from
our left or from our right.
1447.65 And our visual system can help with that.
1450.5 But our auditory and our
visual system collaborate
1453.07 to help us find and locate the
position of things in space.
1457.87 That should come as no surprise.
1459.55 If you hear somebody
talking off to your right,
1462.43 you tend to turn to your
right, not to your left.
1464.8 If you see somebody's mouth
moving in front of you,
1468.25 you tend to assume that
the sound is going to come
1469.96 from right in front of you.
1472.24 Disruptions in this auditory hearing
1475.97 and visual matching are actually the basis
1479.03 of what's called the ventriloquism effect,
1481.28 which we'll talk about in a
few minutes in more depth.
1484.14 But the ventriloquism effect
can basically be described
1487.5 in simple terms as when
you essentially think
1491.76 that a sound is coming from a location
1494.14 that it's not actually coming from.
1497.29 We'll talk about that in a moment
1498.44 but what I'd like you to realize
1501.1 is that one of these stations,
deep in your brainstem
1505.07 is responsible for helping
you identify where sounds
1508.21 are coming from through a process
1510.49 that's called interaural time differences.
1512.91 And that sounds fancy, but really,
1514.88 the way you know where
things are coming from,
1518.02 what direction a car or a boss
or a person is coming from
1521.33 is because the sound lands
in one ear before the other.
1525.02 And you have stations in your brain,
1527.294 meaning you have neurons in your brain
1529.21 that calculate the
difference in time of arrival
1531.89 for those sound waves in your
right versus your left ear.
1535.38 And if they arrive at the same time,
1537.27 you assume that thing is making
noise right in front of you.
1541.02 If it's off to your right,
1542.25 you assume it's over on your right.
1543.79 And if the sound arrives
first to your left ear,
1545.656 you assume, quite correctly,
1547.85 that the thing is coming
toward your left ear.
1550.96 So it's a very simple
and mechanical system
1553.75 at the level of sound localization.
1557.92 But what about up and down?
1559.29 If you think about it, a
sound coming from above
1561.61 is going to land on your right ear
1562.89 and your left ear at the same time.
1565.81 A sound from below is going
to land on your right ear
1567.77 and your left ear at the same time.
1569.55 So the way that we know where things are
1572.75 in terms of what's called elevation,
1575.26 where they are in the up and down plane
1579.05 is by the frequencies.
1581.35 The shape of your ears
actually modifies the sound
1585.49 depending on whether or not
it's coming straight at you,
1587.81 from the floor or from high above.
1590.78 And so already at the level of your ears,
1594.39 you are taking information
about the outside world
1597.17 and determining where that
information is coming from.
1600.8 Now, this all happens very,
very fast and it's subconscious
1604.15 but now you know why if people
really want to hear something,
1608.73 they make a cup around their ear.
1611.65 They essentially make their ear
1613.32 into more of a fennec fox type ear.
1615.75 If you've ever seen those
cute little fennec fox things,
1618.4 they have these big spiky ears,
1619.85 they look like a French bulldog,
1621.47 although the fox version
version of the French bulldog.
1624.48 This big, tall ears,
1626.12 and they have excellent
sound localization.
1628.29 And so when people lean in with their ear,
1630.705 with their hand like this,
if you're listening to this,
1633.04 I'm just cupping my hand at my ear,
1635.26 I'm giving myself a bigger pinna.
1638.18 And if I do it on the left
side, I can do this side.
1640.19 And if I really want to hear
something, I do it on both sides.
1643.69 So this isn't just gesturing,
1645.35 this actually serves a mechanical role.
1647.43 And actually, if you
want to hear where things
1649.46 are coming from with a much
greater degree of accuracy,
1653.74 this can actually help because
you're capturing sound waves
1656.98 and funneling them better.
1659.373 It's really remarkable, this whole system.
1662.49 So you've got these two ears
and because of the differences
1664.95 in the timing of when things
arrive in those two ears,
1667.6 as well as these differences
in the frequencies
1669.841 that certain things sound,
1672.92 or I should say the
differences in the frequencies
1675.567 that arrive at your ears,
1677.32 depending on whether or
not the thing is above you
1679.97 or right in front of you or below you,
1681.64 you're able to make out where things are
1683.05 in space pretty well.
1684.37 So now you're probably starting to realize
1686.17 that these two things
on the side of our head
1687.65 that we call ears are there for a lot more
1690.76 than hanging earrings on or
for other aesthetic purposes
1694.9 or for putting sunglasses on top of.
1697.66 They are very powerful devices
1701.3 for allowing us to capture sound
waves from our environment.
1706.62 Now I have a question for you,
1708.66 which is, can you move your ears?
1711.98 It turns out that unlike other animals,
1715.52 humans are not terrifically
good at moving their ears.
1718.95 Other animals can move their
ears even independently.
1722.28 So Costello is pretty
good at raising his ears,
1724.9 the two of them together,
1725.8 He can't really move his ear separately.
1728.35 Some dogs can do that really well.
1730.53 In fact, sighthounds and some scenthounds
1733.79 do that exquisitely well.
1735.51 Some animals like deer and other animals
1738.48 that really have very acute hearing
1742.11 will put one ear down to
a very particular angle
1745.99 and will tilt the other one
1747.22 and they will actually capture information
1750.57 about two distant sound-making organisms,
1755.06 those could be hunters coming after them
1756.98 or other animals coming after them.
1758.65 They are very good at doing this.
1760.25 We're not so good at it.
1761.47 But about 60% of people, it's thought,
1764.99 can move their ears consciously
1767.56 without having to touch their ear.
1769.24 So can you do that?
1770.71 Maybe you should try it.
1771.543 Ask someone to look at you
1772.98 and see whether or not you can do it.
1774.48 The typical distances
that people can move it
1777.73 is usually no more than
two or three millimeters.
1780.34 It's subtle but can you flap your pinna
1782.537 with just using mental control?
1785.77 If you can, or if you can't,
1789.084 try looking all the way to your right
1792.12 or all the way to your left.
1793.123 Obviously, if you're driving a car
1794.96 or doing something or exercising,
1796.52 don't put yourself in danger right now.
1797.82 But if you move your eyes
all the way to your left,
1801.42 which I'm doing now or
all the way to my right,
1804.05 you might feel a little bit of
a contraction of the muscles
1807.149 that control ear movement.
1811.85 Now I want to ask you this:
can you raise one eyebrow?
1814.59 I'm not very good at it,
I can do a little bit,
1816.62 but it's mostly by like cramping
down my face on one side.
1820.08 And I certainly can't
raise my right eyebrow.
1822.33 I can only do my left eyebrow.
1824.65 Trying to talk while I'm doing this,
1825.483 that's why it looks strange.
1827.08 People who can raise
one eyebrow very easily,
1831.33 almost always, can move their ears
1833.89 without having to touch them.
1835.5 It's controlled by the same motor pathway.
1839.54 And there does seem to be a small,
1841.48 but statistically
significant sex difference
1843.731 in the ability to move one's ears.
1847.22 Typically, men can do
this more than women can,
1850.5 although plenty of women
can move their ears as well.
1854.4 Now, if you think that is all
a little strange or off topic,
1857.97 it's not because what we're
really talking about here
1861.009 is a system of the brain,
but also of the body
1865.52 of the musculature for
localizing things in space.
1868.44 And so you might find
it interesting to note
1871.26 that one of the things
that we share very closely
1874.68 with other primates,
with non-human primates,
1877.98 like macaque monkeys and chimpanzees,
1880.52 if you look at their ears,
1882.55 their ears are remarkably
similar to our ears,
1885.83 or rather our ears are
remarkably similar to their ears.
1889.94 The eyes of certain monkeys
like macaque monkeys
1893.67 are remarkably similar to human eyes.
1896.94 This is one of the reasons why,
1898.15 if you look at a baby macaque monkey,
1900.12 it has this unbelievably
human element to it.
1904.34 But the ears of these
primates is very similar
1906.95 to our ears; our ears,
similar to their ears.
1911.68 If you're interested in ear movements
1914.22 and what they could mean
and some of the things
1917.54 that ear movements correlate
with in other aspects
1920.34 of our biology, there's
a nice paper, actually,
1923.03 a scientific paper.
1924.293 The author's last name is Code, C-O-D-E,
1927.97 it was published in 1995.
1929.65 I'll give a reference to that.
1931.05 It's a review article that discusses
1933.51 some of the sex differences
in ear movement control,
1936.95 as well as the relationship
between ear movements
1938.96 and eye movements.
1940.2 And it's a pretty accessible paper.
1941.88 It's one that I think any
of you who are interested
1944.11 in this topic could parse fairly easily.
1947.05 And there's some very
interesting underlying biology
1949.9 and some theories as to why humans
1952.24 would have this so-called vestigial
1954.35 or ancient carry-over of a
system for moving our ears.
1958.82 Now, if ear movement seems strange,
1963.04 next, I want to talk
about a different feature
1965.258 of your hearing and ears
that's even stranger,
1969.96 but that has some really
interesting implications
1972.663 for your biology.
1975.7 And I'm guessing that
you've not heard of this.
1981.14 What am I about to describe
1982.38 are called otoacoustic emissions.
1985.2 And otoacoustic emissions,
as the name suggests,
1988.21 are sounds that your ears make.
1992.26 Believe it or not, 70%
of people make noises
1997.08 with their ears, but they
don't actually detect them.
2000.41 Like I said, you've never heard of this.
2001.87 Okay, that's not what I mean.
2004.62 But what I do mean is
that 70% of people's ears
2008.72 are making noise that's
cast out of the ear.
2011.97 And these otoacoustic emissions, actually,
2013.87 can be detected by microphones.
2015.41 Sometimes they can be
detected by other people
2017.9 in the room if they
have very good hearing.
2020.52 Now, it turns out that women
or, I should be technical here,
2025.21 females who report
themselves as heterosexual,
2029.87 have a higher frequency,
not frequency of sound,
2032.7 but a higher frequency
of otoacoustic emissions
2036.88 than do men who report
themselves as heterosexual.
2040.47 Women who report themselves
as homosexual or bisexual,
2045.68 make fewer otoacoustic emissions
than heterosexual women.
2050.69 These are data that come
from Dennis McFadden's lab
2053.66 at the University of Texas, Austin.
2055.72 He actually discovered these,
2057.51 what are called sexual
dimorphisms and differences
2060.51 based on sexual orientation
without looking for them.
2063.57 He was studying hearing.
2065.01 He's a auditory scientist
and people were coming
2068.05 into his laboratory
and they were detecting
2070.23 these otoacoustic emissions.
2071.43 And they started to notice
the group differences
2075.07 in otoacoustic emissions.
2076.3 So they started asking
people about their sex
2079.33 and about their sexual orientation.
2081.36 And these differences fell
out of the data, as we say.
2085.34 And it's interesting because
otoacoustic emissions
2088.48 are not something that we associate
2089.81 with sex or sexual dimorphism.
2092.39 But what these data really
underscore is, first of all,
2095.63 a lot of us are making
noises with our ears,
2097.8 some of us more than others.
2099.45 And that exposure to certain
combinations of hormones
2104.25 during development are
very likely shaping the way
2107.52 that our hearing apparati,
meaning the cochlea
2110.67 and the pinna and all sorts of things,
2112.59 how those develop and how those functions
2114.44 throughout the lifespan.
2115.66 We did do an episode on
hormones and sexual development,
2119.21 which gets much deeper
into the other effects
2121.97 that hormones have on the
developing brain and body.
2124.42 If you want to check out that episode,
2126.239 we will put a link to it in the captions.
2129.87 So now I want to shift to talking
2131.3 about ways to leverage
your hearing system,
2134.86 your auditory system so
that you can learn anything,
2137.9 not just auditory information,
but anything faster.
2141.95 I get a lot of questions about
so-called binaural beats.
2145.96 Binaural beats, as their name suggests,
2148.25 involve playing one
frequency of sound to one ear
2152.51 and a different frequency
of sound to the other ear.
2155.23 So it might be doomed, doon,
doon, doon to your right ear,
2159.23 and it might be to
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding
2161.64 to the left ear.
2163.05 And the idea is that the brain
2165.86 will take those two frequencies of sound
2168.952 and because the pathways
that bring information
2172.3 from the ears into the
brain, eventually crossover,
2174.92 they actually share that
information with both sides
2177.64 of the brain, that the brain
will average that information
2180.939 and come up with this sort
of intermediate frequency.
2185.05 And the rationale is that
those intermediate frequencies
2188.38 place the brain into a state
that is better for learning.
2192.49 And when I say better for learning,
2194.7 I want to be precise about what I mean.
2196.66 That could mean more focus for encoding
2199.592 or bringing the information in.
2202.86 As you may have heard me say before,
2204.76 we have to be alert and
focused in order to learn.
2207.28 There is no passive learning
2208.49 unless we're little tiny infants.
2211.06 So can binaural beats
make us more focused?
2214.81 Can binaural beats allow us to
relax more if we're anxious?
2218.8 I know some people, they go to the dentist
2220.33 and the dentist offers binaural beats
2222.4 as they drill into your
teeth and give root canals
2224.69 and things of that sort,
probably causing some anxiety
2226.85 just describing those things right now.
2229.75 But those are available
in many dental practices.
2235.033 Binaural beats have been
thought to increase creativity,
2238.52 or at least they have been
proposed to increase creativity.
2240.66 So what does the scientific
data say about binaural beats?
2243.37 There are a number of
different apps out there
2245.14 that offer binaural beats.
2247.02 There are a number of different programs.
2248.53 I think you can also even
just find these on YouTube
2251.197 and on the internet.
2252.2 But typically, it's an
app and you'll program in
2254.61 a particular outcome that you want:
2256.16 more focused, more creative, fall asleep,
2258.44 less anxious, et cetera.
2260.54 So what does the scientific data say?
2262.45 So believe it or not, the
science on binaural beats
2265.1 is actually quite
extensive and very precise.
2268.55 So sound waves are measured, typically,
2271.99 in hertz or kilohertz.
2273.53 I know many of you aren't familiar
2274.81 with thinking about things
in hertz or kilohertz.
2276.94 But again, just remember
those waves on a pond,
2279.72 those ripples on a pond.
2281.5 If they're close together, then
they are of high-frequency.
2286.47 And if they're far apart, than
they are of low frequency.
2288.73 So when you hear more hertz,
2290.88 what you're essentially
hearing is higher frequency.
2294.69 And so if it's many more kilohertz
2296.35 then it's much higher frequency
2297.57 than if it's fewer hertz or kilohertz.
2299.57 And so you may have heard of
these things as delta waves
2303.25 or theta waves or alpha waves
or beta waves, et cetera.
2306.72 Delta waves would be big,
slow waves, so low frequency.
2310.35 And, indeed, there is quality evidence
2313.116 from peer-reviewed studies
that are not sponsored
2316.11 by companies that make binaural beat apps
2318.522 that tell us that delta
waves like one to four hertz,
2322.8 so very low frequency sounds,
think Costello's snoring,
2326.32 can help in the transition to
sleep and for staying asleep.
2331.09 And that theta rhythms,
2332.72 which are more like four to eight hertz
2335.06 can bring the brain into
a state of subtle sleep
2340.62 or meditation, so deeply
relaxed, but not fully asleep.
2344.35 And then you can sort of ascend
2345.85 the staircase of findings
here, so to speak.
2347.92 And you'll find evidence that alpha waves,
2349.9 eight to 13 hertz can increase alertness
2352.62 to a moderate level.
2354.03 That's a great state
for the brain to be in
2356.39 for recall of existing information.
2360.282 And that beta waves, 15 to 20 hertz
2362.881 are great for bringing the brain
2365.38 into focus states for sustained thought
2369.13 or for incorporating new information
2371.69 and especially gamma waves,
the highest frequency,
2374.14 the most frequent ripples
of sound, so to speak,
2377.71 32 to 100 hertz for learning
and problem-solving.
2381.64 Now, all of this matches, or I should say,
2384.21 maps onto what I've said before
2386.79 about learning really nicely,
2388.58 which is that you need to
be in a highly alert state
2390.9 in order to bring new information in,
2392.88 in order to access a state of mind
2395.48 in which you can tell
your brain or the brain
2398.06 is telling itself, okay,
I need to learn this.
2399.91 This is why stress and
unfortunate circumstances
2402.101 are so memorable is because our brain gets
2404.5 into a really high alert system.
2406.13 Here, we're talking about
the use of binaural beats
2408.42 in order to increase
our level of alertness
2411.25 or our level of calmness.
2414.18 Now that's important to
underscore because it's not
2416.843 that there's something
fundamentally important
2419.05 about the binaural beats.
2420.81 They are yet another way
of bringing the brain
2423.43 into states of deep relaxation
2426.1 through low frequency sound
or highly alert states
2429.88 for focused learning with
more high-frequency sound.
2433.49 So they are effective and
I'll review a little bit
2436.79 of the data in detail, they're effective,
2440.07 but it's not that they're
uniquely special for learning.
2444.96 It's just that they can
help some people bring
2447.22 their brain into the state that
allows them to learn better.
2450.86 So there are a lot of studies
that allowed us to arrive,
2455.08 or I should say allowed
the field to arrive
2457.77 on these parameters of slow, slow,
2461.69 low frequency waves are going to
bring you into relaxed states,
2463.93 high frequency waves
into more alert states.
2468.27 There's very good evidence
for anxiety reduction
2471.66 from the use of binaural beats.
2474.31 And what's interesting is
anxiety reduction seems
2478.7 to be most effective
when the binaural beats
2483.01 are bringing the brain into delta,
2485.32 so those slow big waves like
sleep, theta and alpha states.
2490.29 And I'll link to a couple of these studies
2492.33 although I will probably
link more to the list
2496.06 that really segregates them out one by one
2498.06 so you can see them all
next to one another.
2499.601 There's good evidence that binaural beats
2501.6 can be used to treat pain, chronic pain.
2503.89 There's three studies in
peer-reviewed journals
2507.68 which I took a look at, and
they seem to be of good quality,
2511.62 not sponsored research, as we say,
2513.56 not paid for by any specific company.
2516.0 Binaural beats have been shown
2517.17 to modestly improve cognition,
2520.09 attention, working memory
and even creativity.
2523.72 But the real boost from
binaural beats appears
2527.05 to be for anxiety reduction
and pain reduction.
2531.03 Some people might find these beneficial
2532.72 for these oral surgeries, right?
2535.633 Believe it or not, there are people
2537.47 who would rather have
the entire root canal
2541.81 or cavity drilled without Novocaine.
2544.26 And that's because they
sometimes have a syringe phobia
2547.56 or something of that sort
2548.393 or they just don't like being
numb from the Novocaine,
2550.17 or maybe there's an
underlying medical reason.
2552.13 But I think most people
do don't enjoy getting
2554.63 their teeth drilled even if
they have Novocaine in there
2556.68 or a root canal.
2557.89 And so it seems that binaural
beats can be effective
2560.54 in that environment.
2561.72 And you don't have to go
2562.65 into that sort of extreme environment
2564.04 to benefit from binaural beats.
2565.42 Binaural beats are a either
relatively inexpensive thing
2571.41 to access, most of the apps
are pretty inexpensive.
2573.76 I don't have a favorite binaural beats app
2576.52 to recommend to you.
2577.71 I confess I did use binaural
beats a few years ago.
2580.17 I shifted over to other what I call NSDR,
2584.07 non-sleep deep rest
protocols in favor of those,
2586.55 but many people like binaural beats
2588.63 and say that they benefit from them,
2590.75 especially while studying or learning.
2593.49 I think part of the
reason for that relates
2596.12 to the ability to channel our focus
2599.38 when we have some background noise.
2601.37 And this is something I
also get asked about a lot.
2604.17 Is it better to listen to
music and have background noise
2606.863 when studying or is it better
to have complete silence?
2609.85 Well, there's actually
a quite good literature
2612.42 on this as well, but not
so much as it relates
2615.24 to binaural beats, but
rather whether or not people
2617.93 are listening to music, so-called
white noise, brown noise;
2622.49 believe it or not, there's white noise
2623.61 and there's brown noise,
there's even pink noise
2626.12 and how that impacts brain states
2629.16 that allow us to learn
information better or not.
2632.35 So now I'd like to talk about white noise
2635.15 and I want to be very
clear that white noise
2638.01 has been shown to really enhance
brain states for learning
2642.52 in certain individuals,
in particular, in adults.
2646.5 But white noise actually can
have a detrimental effect
2649.52 on auditory learning and
maybe even the development
2652.07 of the auditory system
in very young children
2654.92 in particular in infants.
2656.98 So first I'd like to talk
2658.07 about the beneficial effects
of white noise on learning.
2662.424 There are some really
excellent studies on this.
2665.49 The first one that I'd like
2666.5 to just highlight is one that's entitled:
2670.34 Low Intensity White Noise
Improves Performance
2672.83 in Auditory Working Memory
Task, an fMRI Study.
2676.01 This is a study that explored
2679.55 whether or not learning could be enhanced
2683.03 by playing white noise in the background.
2686.14 But the strength of the
study is that they looked
2688.9 at some of the underlying neural circuitry
2690.447 and the activation of the neural circuitry
2692.34 in these people as they
did the learning task.
2694.41 And what it, essentially, illustrates
2696.81 is that white noise,
provided that white noise
2700.29 is of low enough intensity,
meaning not super loud,
2704.566 not imperceptible, so not so
quiet that you can't hear it,
2709.14 but not super loud either,
2710.78 it actually could enhance
learning to a significant degree.
2713.77 And this has been shown now
2715.0 for a huge number of
different types of learning.
2719.89 There's a terrific article as well
2722.18 in a somewhat obscure journal, at least,
2723.93 obscure to me, which is:
2724.91 The Effects of Noise Exposure
on Cognitive Performance
2727.48 and Brain Activity Patterns.
2730.29 That's a study involving 54 subjects.
2733.6 They, basically, were
evaluated for mental workload
2736.43 and attention under different
levels of noise exposure,
2739.73 background noise and
different, essentially,
2742.48 loudness of noise.
2743.59 And the reason I like this
study is that they looked
2745.79 at different levels of
noise and types of noise,
2747.506 and they varied a number
of different things,
2750.48 as opposed to just doing a two-condition,
2752.81 either white noise or no
white noise type thing.
2755.28 And what they found, again, is
that provided the white noise
2758.85 is not extremely loud,
2760.73 it could really enhance brain function
2762.96 for sake of learning any number
2764.55 of different kinds of information.
2767.44 Now that's all great, but
it really doesn't get to
2770.664 the deeper guts of mechanism.
2772.93 And as a neuroscientist,
what I really want to see
2775.15 is not just that something has an effect.
2776.91 That's always nice.
2777.743 It's always nice to see in
a nice peer-reviewed study
2780.37 without any kind of commercial biases
2782.39 that there's an effect, binaural
beats can enhance learning
2785.3 or listening to white noise, not too loud
2787.51 can enhance learning.
2788.97 But you really want to
understand mechanism
2791.61 because once you understand mechanism,
2794.81 not only does it start to make sense,
2796.34 but you can also imagine ways in which
2797.927 you could develop better
tools and protocols.
2800.71 So I was very relieved to find,
2803.54 or I should say excited to
find this study published
2806.23 in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,
2808.5 this is a 2014 paper, White
Noise Improves Learning
2813.24 by Modulating Activity in
Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions
2817.41 and Right Superior Temporal Sulcus.
2819.67 Now I don't expect you to know
2820.54 what the right spirit temporal sulcus is.
2822.039 I don't expect you to know
2823.53 what the dopamine midbrain
region is, but if you're like me,
2827.33 you probably took highlighted notice
2829.77 of the word dopaminergic.
2831.26 Dopamine is a neuromodulator,
meaning it's a chemical
2834.77 that's released in our brain and body,
2836.47 but mostly in our brain that modulates,
2840.16 meaning controls the likelihood
2843.15 that certain brain areas will be active
2844.83 and other brain areas won't be active.
2846.53 And dopamine is associated
with motivation.
2848.77 Dopamine is associated with craving.
2850.55 Motivation is associated with
all sorts of different things,
2852.84 including movement but what
this study so nicely shows
2858.11 is that white noise can really enhance
2862.25 the activity of neurons in what's called
2863.97 the substantia nigra VTA.
2865.85 The substantia nigra VTA is a
very rich source of dopamine
2870.27 and that's because it's
very chockablock full
2873.67 of dopamine neurons.
2875.54 It's an area of the
brain that is, perhaps,
2878.18 the richest source of dopamine neurons.
2881.31 And you actually can see this brain region
2883.78 under the microscope if
you take a slice of brain
2885.53 or you look at a brain
without even staining it
2888.24 for any proteins or dopamine or anything.
2890.49 It's two very dark regions
at the bottom of the brain.
2894.74 And the reason it's
called substantia nigra,
2897.54 nigra meaning dark is
because the dopamine neurons
2901.28 actually make something that
makes those neurons dark.
2905.75 And so you've got these
two regions down there,
2907.713 that contain dopamine
and can release dopamine
2910.6 and, essentially, activate
other brain regions
2913.0 and activate our sense of motivation
2914.72 and activate our sense of desire
2916.74 to continue focusing and learning.
2919.04 But you can't just snap your fingers
2921.49 and make them release dopamine.
2922.52 You actually have to trigger
dopamine release from them.
2924.98 Now that trigger can be
caused by being very excited
2928.02 about something or the fact
that that thing gave you
2930.83 a lot of pleasure in the past,
2932.19 or you're highly motivated
by fear or desire.
2935.2 But what's so interesting
to me is that it appears
2938.63 that white noise itself can
raise what we call the basal,
2943.43 the baseline levels of dopamine
that are being released
2946.58 from this area, the substantia nigra.
2949.32 So now we're starting to
get a more full picture
2953.03 of how particular sounds
in our environment
2955.7 can increase learning.
2958.3 And that's, in part, I believe,
2960.46 through the release of
dopamine from substantia nigra.
2964.75 So I'm not trying to shift
you away from binaural beats,
2968.26 if that's your thing, but it does appear
2970.86 that turning on white noise
at a low level, not too loud.
2973.89 You may say, "Well, how loud?"
2975.13 And I'll tell you in a moment,
2976.18 but not too loud can
allow you to learn better
2979.39 because of the ways that it's modulating
2981.31 your brain chemistry.
2982.69 So how loud or how soft
should that white noise be
2986.628 while you learn?
2988.94 Well, in these studies,
it seemed that white noise
2992.49 that could be heard by the person,
2994.35 so it wasn't imperceptible to them,
2995.87 so it was loud enough that they
could hear, but not so loud
3001.11 that they felt it was intrusive
or irritating to them.
3005.8 So that's going to differ
from person to person
3007.68 because people have different levels
3009.13 of auditory sensitivity.
3010.9 It's going to depend
on age, going to depend
3012.3 on a number of different factors.
3013.84 So I can't tell you turn to level two
3016.281 on your volume controller.
3017.95 That's just not going to work.
3018.783 Also, I don't know how far you are
3020.11 from a given speaker in the room
3021.63 or if you've got earphones in your head
3023.47 or you've got speakers in the room
3026.11 or if it's coming out of your computer.
3027.81 I don't know those things.
3029.0 So what you're going
to have to do is adjust
3030.35 that white noise to the place
3032.24 where it's not interfering
with your ability to focus,
3035.11 but rather it's enhancing
your ability to focus.
3037.84 I think a good rule of thumb
is going to be to put it
3042.07 probably on the lower third
of any kind of volume dial,
3046.11 as opposed to in the upper third,
3049.21 where it would really be blasting.
3051.52 And really blasting any
noise, frankly, is not good,
3055.87 but that's especially not good,
meaning it's especially bad
3059.65 if you have headphones in.
3061.48 I do want to mention
something about headphones
3063.5 before I talk about white noise
in the developmental context
3067.04 and why it can be dangerous there.
3069.63 When you put headphones in your ears,
3073.89 it has this incredible
effect of making the sounds
3077.77 like they come from inside your head,
3079.73 not from out in the room.
3081.71 And now that might seem
like kind of a duh,
3083.76 but that's actually really amazing, right?
3085.9 Your brain assumes that the sounds
3087.77 are coming from inside your head,
3090.14 as opposed from the environment
3091.64 that you're in the moment
you put headphones in.
3093.63 So if you're listening to an audiobook
3094.98 or maybe you're listening to
this podcast with headphones,
3097.29 that's very different
than when you're listening
3099.14 to something out in the room
and there are other sounds,
3101.68 other sound waves, especially if you use
3103.24 these noise-cancellation headphones.
3105.22 So if you're going to use
white noise to enhance studying
3109.55 or learning of any
kind, this also could be
3111.36 for skill-learning, motor skill-learning
3112.78 while you're exercising,
my suggestion would be
3116.8 that if you're using headphones,
to keep it quite low.
3120.31 This is an effect on the
midbrain dopamine neurons
3123.42 that's a background effect of raising
3125.16 the baseline of dopamine release.
3126.73 The way that dopamine neurons
fires, they're always firing;
3128.91 yours are firing right now, so are mine,
3130.72 when something exciting
happens, they fire a lot.
3133.02 And when something disappointing happens,
3134.41 that firing, the release of dopamine
3136.34 goes down below baseline.
3138.01 What you're talking about here is raising
3139.6 your overall levels of
attention and motivation,
3141.66 which translate to better learning
3143.48 by just tickling those
neurons a little bit,
3146.33 raising the baseline firing.
3149.06 You're not turning up the white noise
3150.2 to the point where you're feeling amazing.
3152.1 This isn't like turning
on your favorite song.
3154.1 This is actually the opposite.
3155.83 This is about getting that
baseline up just a bit.
3159.93 So I recommend turning
the volume up just a bit
3163.46 so that you can focus entirely on the task
3166.78 that you're trying to do.
3167.613 And, of course, you've
turned on white noise
3169.29 so your attention might
drift to that for a moment.
3170.9 Is it too loud? Is it too soft?
3172.87 If you can disappear into
the work, so to speak,
3175.33 if your attention can
disappear into the work,
3177.18 then that's probably sufficiently quiet.
3180.31 And for those of you that say,
3181.33 well, I like really loud music
3182.6 and if I just blast the music,
3184.43 then I forget about the music.
3186.86 I don't suggest blasting music.
3188.58 And this is coming from somebody
3189.57 who really likes loud music.
3192.25 I grew up with kind of a
loud fast rules mentality,
3194.67 and if you don't know what
loud fast rules means,
3197.43 then I can't help you, but
there's a time and a place,
3202.08 perhaps, to listen to music loud
3203.67 but, especially, with headphones,
3205.63 you can trigger, excuse me,
hearing loss quite rapidly.
3210.03 And unfortunately,
because these hair cells
3213.21 that we talked about earlier,
3214.17 our central nervous system
neurons, they do not regenerate,
3217.14 they do not come back.
3219.03 Now along the lines of hearing loss,
3223.02 I should just say that the best way
3225.22 to blow out your hearing for good,
3227.22 to eliminate your hearing
is to have very loud sounds
3231.9 super imposed on a loud environment.
3234.89 So loud environments can
cause hearing loss over time.
3237.43 So if you work at a construction
site, clanging really loud,
3240.33 or if you work the sound
board in a club or something,
3243.73 you are headed towards hearing loss
3245.76 unless you protect your hearing
3247.63 with earplugs and headphones.
3249.698 Nowadays, some of the ear
plugs are very low profile,
3252.84 meaning you can't see them.
3253.89 So that's kind of nice,
so you're not like the,
3256.16 when I was younger, like you
didn't want to be the dork
3257.99 to go to the concert with the earplugs,
3259.41 but it turns out those dorks were smarter
3260.98 than everybody else,
because they're not the ones
3263.24 who are craning their neck to
try and hear trivial things
3267.97 at the age of 30 or so 'cause
they blew out their hearing.
3272.49 So if you are working
in a loud environment
3275.38 or you expose yourselves
to a loud environment,
3278.69 you really want to avoid big inflections
3282.02 in sound above that.
3283.4 So loud environment plus fireworks,
3287.24 loud environment plus gunshot,
3289.19 loud environments plus very
high-frequency intense sound,
3293.137 that's what we call the two-hit model,
3296.626 this is also true for concussion,
3297.84 that you can take a stimulus that normally
3300.49 would be below the threshold of injury,
3302.08 you add another stimulus at the same time,
3305.18 that would be below the
threshold of injury.
3306.84 And then, suddenly,
you killed the neurons.
3308.84 So I don't want to make people paranoid,
3310.61 but you do want to protect your hearing.
3311.88 It's no fun to lose your hearing.
3313.64 If you're going to use
headphones and you feel
3315.76 like you want to crank it up all the way,
3317.1 just remember that the
more that you can get
3320.78 out of a lower volume, meaning the longer
3322.83 that you can go listening
to things at lower volume,
3325.69 the longer you'll be able to
hear that music or that thing.
3330.18 So again, I'm not the hearing cop.
3333.88 That's not my job, but
as somebody who's lost
3336.79 some of his high-frequency hearing,
3338.7 I can tell you it's not a pleasure.
3342.067 The old argument that it
helps you not have to hear
3345.123 or listen to people that
you don't want to listen to,
3347.32 that does it doesn't really work.
3348.38 They just send you text messages instead.
3350.42 So what about white noise and
hearing loss in development?
3354.0 I know a lot of people with children
3355.38 have these noise machines like sound waves
3358.68 and things like that,
that help the kids sleep.
3361.0 And look, I think kids getting good sleep
3363.67 and parents getting good sleep is vital
3365.53 to physical and mental
health and family health.
3368.99 So I certainly sympathize
with those needs.
3373.93 However, there are data that indicate
3377.04 that white noise during development
3379.82 can be detrimental to the auditory system.
3382.44 I don't want to frighten any parents
3383.74 if you played white noise to your kids,
3385.53 this doesn't mean that
their auditory system
3387.09 or their speech patterns
are going to be disrupted
3389.79 or that their interpretation of speech
3391.15 is going to be disrupted forever.
3392.93 But there are data published
in the journal, Science,
3397.077 and Science being one of
the three, APEX Journal,
3399.61 Science, Nature, Cell, the
most stringent journals,
3403.4 data published in the journal,
Science, some years ago,
3406.21 actually by a scientist
who I know quite well,
3408.33 his name is Edward Chang,
he's a medical doctor now,
3410.86 he's a neurosurgeon, he's actually
3412.27 the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF
3415.14 and he runs a laboratory where
they study auditory learning,
3418.87 neuroplasticity, et cetera,
he and his mentor at the time,
3423.12 Mike Merzenich published a paper showing
3426.19 that if young animals and
this was in animal models
3430.49 were exposed to white noise, so [shushing]
3435.02 the very type of noise that
I'm saying as a older person,
3438.726 and when I say older,
I mean, somebody who's
3440.98 in their late teens, early 20s and older
3443.14 could benefit from listening
to that at a low level
3445.93 in the background for sake of learning,
3448.202 well, they exposed very young
animals to this white noise,
3451.642 it actually disrupted the
maps of the auditory world
3456.63 within the brain.
3457.463 And we haven't talked
about these maps yet,
3459.28 but I want to take a
moment and talk about them
3460.71 and explain this effect and
what it might mean for you
3464.05 if you have kids or if you were exposed
3465.58 to a lot of white noise early on.
3467.66 So auditory information goes
up into our cortex, into these,
3473.309 essentially, the outside
portion of our brain
3475.79 that's responsible for all
our higher level cognition
3479.55 and our planning, our
decision-making, et cetera,
3481.84 creativity and up there,
3484.72 we have what are called tonotopic maps.
3486.97 What's a tonotopic map?
3488.43 Well, remember the
cochlea, how it's coiled
3490.77 and at one end, it responds
to high frequencies
3492.517 and the other end, it
responds to low frequencies?
3495.77 Like a piano, the keys sound different
3497.78 as you extend down and up the piano keys.
3501.0 And it's organized in
a very systematic way.
3503.72 It's not all intermixed high frequencies
3505.264 and low frequencies.
3506.3 It's organized in a very systematic way
3509.07 from one end to the other.
3510.73 Your visual system is in,
what's called a retinotopic map.
3513.66 So neighboring points in
space off to my right,
3516.88 like my two fingers off to my right
3518.94 are mapped to neighboring
points in space in my brain.
3523.03 And that space right in front of me
3525.44 is mapped to a different
location in my brain,
3527.2 but it's systematic, it's regular.
3528.98 It's not random. It's not salt and pepper.
3531.08 It goes from high to low or
from right to center to left.
3535.0 In the auditory system,
3536.11 we have what are called tonotopic maps,
3538.5 where frequency, high
frequency to low frequency
3542.36 and everything in between is organized
3544.27 in a very systematic way.
3546.37 Now our experience of life from the time
3548.95 we're a baby until the time
that we die is not systematic.
3552.68 We don't hear low frequencies
at one part of the room
3554.846 or at one part of the
day and high frequencies
3556.81 is another part of the room
and other part of the day,
3558.87 they're all intermixed.
3560.42 But if you remember, the
cochlea separates them out.
3563.52 Just like a prism of light separates out
3565.58 the different wavelengths of light,
3566.78 the cochlea separates out
the different frequencies.
3570.02 And the developing brain takes
3572.77 those separated out frequencies
and learns this relationship
3577.04 between itself, meaning the
child and the outside world.
3583.46 White noise, essentially contains
no tonotopic information.
3588.61 The frequencies are all intermixed.
3591.3 It's just noise.
3592.87 Whereas when I speak, my voice has,
3595.45 now I'm getting technical,
but it has what's called
3597.41 a certain envelope, meaning
it has some low frequencies
3600.14 and some slightly higher frequency.
3600.973 Like I might a voice higher,
3602.8 although I'm not very good at that.
3604.09 My voice starts to crack and
I can make my voice lower,
3607.22 although not as low as Costello's snore.
3608.9 So it has an envelope, it has a container.
3612.32 White noise has no container.
3614.04 It's like all the colors of the
rainbow spread out together,
3617.44 which is actually what you
get when you get white light
3619.9 white noise is analogous to white light.
3623.44 So one of the reasons why
hearing a lot of white noise
3629.64 during development for
long periods of time can be
3631.9 detrimental to the development
of the auditory system
3634.41 is that these tonotopic
maps don't form normally;
3637.18 at least, they don't in
experimental animals.
3639.07 Now, the reason I'm raising this
3641.9 is that many people I know, in particular,
3643.86 friends who have small children, they say,
3646.367 "I want to use a white
noise machine while I sleep.
3652.01 But is it okay for my baby to
use a white noise machine?"
3656.21 And I consulted with various
people, scientists about this.
3659.78 And they said, "Well,
the baby is also hearing
3663.32 the parent's voices and is hearing music
3665.141 and it's hearing the dog bark.
3666.53 So it's not the only
thing they're hearing."
3668.35 However, every single person
that I consulted with said,
3672.737 "But there's neuroplasticity during sleep.
3675.85 That's when the kid is sleeping.
3677.7 And I don't know that you'd
want to expose a child
3680.51 to white noise the entire night,
3682.6 because it might degrade
that tonotopic map."
3686.15 It might not destroy it.
3687.64 It might not eliminate it,
3688.91 but it could make it a little less clear,
3692.04 like taking the keys on the piano
3694.627 and taping a few of them together, right?
3697.4 So you still got the highs and
lows in the appropriate order
3699.98 and everything in between.
3701.11 But when you take the keys together,
3702.75 you don't get the same fidelity.
3704.36 You don't get the same
precision of the noise
3707.95 that comes out of that piano.
3709.926 So, again, I don't want to scare anybody,
3712.96 but I would say if you are in a position
3714.63 to make the choice of
either using white noise
3717.63 or something similar, pink
noise is just a variation.
3720.31 It's got a little bit more
of a certain frequency,
3722.3 just like pink light has a little bit more
3724.22 of a certain wavelength than white light.
3727.22 If you are in a position to make choices
3731.06 about things, to put in a young,
3733.89 especially very young
child's sleeping environment,
3736.43 white noise might be something
to consider avoiding.
3739.72 Again, I'm not telling you what to do,
3741.24 but it's something to
perhaps consider avoiding.
3743.77 I don't think most pediatricians
3745.43 are going to be aware of these data,
3747.34 but if you talk to any
auditory physiologists
3750.25 or an audiologist or somebody
3751.99 who studies auditory development,
3754.33 I'm fairly certain that they
would have opinions about that.
3757.24 Now, whether or not their
opinions agree with mine
3759.48 and these folks that I
consulted with or not
3761.87 is a separate matter.
3762.703 I don't know, cause I don't know them,
3765.0 but it's something that I
felt was important enough
3767.32 to cue you to, especially
since I've highlighted,
3771.49 excuse me, the opposite
effect is true in adulthood.
3774.11 Once your auditory system has formed,
3776.5 once it's established
these tonotopic maps,
3778.68 then the presence of
background white noise
3781.2 should not be a problem at all.
3782.76 In fact, it shouldn't be a problem at all
3785.28 because you're also not attending to it.
3787.33 The idea is that it's playing
at a low enough volume
3789.5 that you forget it in the background
3791.12 and that it's supporting learning
3792.68 by bringing your brain into a
heightened state of alertness
3795.23 and, especially, this
heightened state of dopamine,
3797.97 dopaminergic activation of the brain,
3799.83 which will make it easier to learn faster
3802.39 and easier to learn the information.
3804.72 So now I want to talk
about auditory learning
3807.38 and actually how you can get better
3809.03 at learning information that you hear,
3810.98 not just information
that you see on a page
3813.89 or motor skill learning.
3815.96 There are a lot of reasons
to want to do this.
3817.59 A lot of classroom teaching,
whether or not it's by Zoom
3820.27 or in-person is auditory in nature.
3822.99 Not everything is necessarily
written down for us.
3827.12 It's also good to get better
at listening or so I'm told.
3832.26 So there's a phenomenon called
the cocktail party effect.
3835.99 Now, even if you've never
been to a cocktail party,
3838.1 you've experienced and participated
3840.451 in what's called the
cocktail party effect.
3842.93 The cocktail party effect is where you are
3844.84 in an environment that's rich with sound,
3847.13 many sound waves coming
from many different sources,
3849.78 many different things,
3850.613 so in a city, in a classroom,
3853.26 in a car that contains people
having various conversations,
3857.53 you somehow need to be able to
attend to specific components
3862.07 of those sound waves, meaning you need
3863.45 to hear certain people and not others.
3865.67 The reason it's called
the cocktail party effect
3867.97 is that you and meaning your brain
3871.195 are exquisitely good at creating
3875.59 a cone of auditory attention,
3877.66 a narrow band of attention
with which you can extract
3880.98 the information you care about
3882.81 and wipe away or erase all the rest.
3887.21 Now this takes work, it takes attention.
3890.4 One of the reasons why
you might come home from
3893.4 a loud gathering, maybe
a stadium, a sports event
3896.0 or a cocktail party, for that matter,
3897.84 and feel just exhausted is
because if you were listening
3900.6 to conversations there or trying to listen
3902.52 to those conversations
while watching the game
3904.46 and people moving past you
and hearing all this noise,
3908.03 clinking of glasses, et cetera,
3910.56 it takes attentional effort
and the brain uses up
3914.48 a lot of energy just at rest,
3917.56 but it uses up even more energy
3919.97 when you are paying strong
attention to something,
3922.2 literally caloric energy
burning up things like glucose,
3925.08 et cetera, even if you're
ketogenic, it's burning up energy.
3928.69 So the cocktail party effect
has been studied extensively
3932.7 in the field of
neuroscience and we now know
3934.87 at a mechanistic level,
how one accomplishes
3938.1 this feat of attending to certain sounds,
3940.78 despite the fact that
we are being bombarded
3943.51 with all sorts of other sounds.
3945.41 So there are a couple
ways that we do this.
3946.9 First of all, much as
with our visual system,
3952.0 we can expand or contract
our visual field of view,
3957.79 so we can go from panoramic vision,
3959.61 see the entire scene that we
are in by dilating our gaze,
3963.36 talked a lot about this on
this podcast and elsewhere.
3965.9 We can, for instance, keep
our head and eyes stationary
3968.56 or mostly stationary, you don't
have to be rigid about it,
3970.61 and you can expand your field of view
3972.01 so you can see the walls
and ceiling and floor,
3974.24 can see yourself in the
environment, that's panoramic view.
3976.413 It's what you would accomplish
without having to try at all
3978.92 if you went to a horizon, for instance,
3981.91 or we can contract our field of view,
3983.55 I can bring my focus to
a particular location,
3986.423 what we call a vergence point,
directly in front of me.
3988.61 Now I'm pointing at the camera
directly in front of me.
3991.74 We can do that, we can expand and contract
3993.24 our visual field of view.
3994.26 Well, we can expand and contract
our auditory field of view,
4000.24 so to speak, our auditory window.
4003.14 You can try this next time
you are in an environment
4006.43 that's rich with noise, meaning
lots of different sounds.
4009.5 You can just tune out all the
noise to a background chatter.
4014.76 You try not focus on
any one particular sound
4019.31 and you get the background
chatter of noise.
4022.89 And you'll find that it's
actually very relaxing
4025.07 in comparison to trying
to listen to somebody
4026.89 at a cocktail party or
shouting back and forth.
4028.61 Now, if you're very, very
interested in that person,
4030.61 or getting to know them better
or what they're telling you,
4033.97 or some combination of those things,
4035.47 then you'll be very motivated to do it
4037.47 but nonetheless, it requires energy
4039.67 and effort and attention.
4042.31 How do we do this?
4043.3 Well, it's actually quite simple
4047.3 or, at least, it's simple, in essence,
4049.65 although the underlying
mechanisms are complex.
4052.78 Here, I have to credit the laboratory
4055.93 of a guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R,
4059.61 up at the University of
Oregon who essentially
4063.5 figured out that we are able to accomplish
4065.93 this extraction of particular sounds.
4068.5 We can really hear one person
or a small number of people
4072.18 amidst a huge background of chatter
4074.87 because we pay attention
to the onset of words,
4080.01 but also to the offset of words.
4083.02 Now, the way to visualize this
is if the background noise
4087.07 is just like a bunch of waves of noise,
4088.95 it's literally just sound
waves coming every frequency,
4091.37 low frequency, high frequency,
glasses clinking together.
4093.75 If you've got a game, people are shouting,
4095.24 people are talking on their phone,
4097.12 there's the crack of the ball,
4098.27 if somebody actually
manages to hit the ball,
4102.84 the announcer, et cetera,
4104.4 but whatever we were paying attention to,
4107.34 we set up a cone of auditory attention,
4109.862 a tunnel of auditory attention,
where we are listening
4113.47 although we don't realize
it, we are listening
4114.96 for the onset and the
offset of those words.
4119.11 Now this is powerful
for a couple of reasons.
4121.71 First of all, it's a call
to arms, so to speak,
4127.38 to disengage your auditory system
4130.55 when you don't need to
focus your attention
4132.45 on something particular.
4133.87 So if you are somebody,
you're coming home from work,
4136.05 you've had a very long day
and you're trying to make out
4140.23 a particular conversation
on background noise,
4143.44 you might consider just not
having that conversation,
4146.42 just letting your auditory
landscape be very broad,
4150.46 almost like panoramic vision.
4153.09 If you're trying to learn how
to extract sound information,
4157.1 it could be notes of music,
it could be scales of music,
4162.38 it could be words spoken by somebody else,
4164.83 maybe somebody is telling
you what you need to say
4167.53 for a particular speech or the information
4170.29 that you need to learn
for a particular topic,
4172.6 and they're telling it to you,
4174.94 deliberately paying
attention both to the onset
4177.652 and to the offset of those
words can be beneficial
4181.35 because it is exactly the way
that the auditory system likes
4185.32 to bring in information.
4187.26 So one of the more common phenomenon
4190.5 that I think we all experience
is you go to a party
4193.701 or you meet somebody new and you say hi,
4196.21 I would say, "Hi, I'm Andrew."
4197.4 And they'd say, "Hi,
I'm Jeff," for instance.
4199.797 "Great to meet you."
4200.63 And then a minute later, I
can't remember the guy's name.
4203.96 Now, is it because I don't
care what his name is?
4205.69 No, somehow the presence
4208.13 of other auditory information interfered.
4210.29 It's not that my mind was
necessarily someplace else.
4212.78 It's that the signal-to-noise
as we say wasn't high enough.
4217.54 Somehow the way he said it or
the way it landed on my ears,
4222.49 which is really all that matters,
4224.236 when it comes down to
learning, is such that
4228.68 it just didn't achieve high
enough signal-to-noise.
4231.65 The noise was too high
or the signal was too low
4233.99 or some combination of those.
4235.88 So the next time you ask somebody's name,
4237.49 remember listen to the
onset of what they say
4240.12 and the offset.
4240.953 So it would be paying
attention to the j in Jeff
4243.99 and it would be paying
attention to that in f in F,
4246.98 in Jeff, excuse me.
4249.56 And chances are, you'll be
able to remember that name.
4253.16 Now, I don't know if people
who are super learners
4256.44 of names do this naturally or not.
4259.41 I don't have access to their brains.
4261.03 I don't think they're
going to give me access
4262.21 to their brains either.
4263.53 But it's a very interesting
way to take the natural biology
4267.1 of auditory attention and
learning and apply it to scenarios
4270.16 where you're trying to
remember either people's names
4272.645 or specific information.
4274.57 Now, I do acknowledge that
trying to learn every word
4277.63 in a sentence by paying attention
4279.53 to its onset and offset
could actually be disruptive
4283.05 to the learning process.
4284.83 So this would be more
for specific attention,
4287.38 like you're asking directions
in a city and somebody says,
4289.56 okay, you say you're
lost and they say, okay,
4292.27 you're going to go two blocks down,
4294.58 you're going to turn left.
4295.87 And then you're going to see
a landmark on your right.
4297.86 And then you're going to go in
the third door on your left.
4302.9 That's a lot of information,
at least, for me.
4305.45 So the way you would
want to listen to that
4307.82 is you're going to go down the road.
4310.31 See, I already forgot.
4312.334 You're going to go left and
you're just going to program
4314.87 and instead of just hearing the word left,
4316.24 you're going to think the L at
the front of left and the T.
4319.92 You're going to left, okay.
4323.05 So you're coding in specific words.
4325.09 And what this does is this hijacks
4327.81 these naturally-occurring
attention mechanisms
4330.11 that the auditory system likes to use.
4332.55 So a little bit of data
that for auditory encoding,
4335.5 this kind of thing can be beneficial.
4337.69 There are a lot of data that attention
4340.61 for auditory coding is beneficial.
4343.7 There are a little bit of data showing
4346.7 that deliberately encoding
auditory information this way,
4350.02 meaning trying to learn
auditory information this way
4352.8 can be beneficial or
can accelerate learning.
4355.59 And some of these features
of what I'm describing here,
4359.03 map onto some of the work that
of Mike Merzenich and others
4363.63 that have been designed
to try and overcome things
4366.55 like stutter and to treat various forms
4369.8 of auditory learning disorders.
4372.22 But more importantly,
and perhaps more powerful
4376.64 is the work of Mike
Merzenich that was done
4379.56 with his then graduate
student, Gregg Recanzone
4382.86 that showed that, using
the attentional system,
4386.74 we can actually learn much faster
4389.4 and we can actually
activate neuroplasticity
4392.71 in the adult brain, something
that's very challenging to do.
4396.04 And that the auditory system
is one of the main ways
4399.5 in which we can access
neuroplasticity more broadly.
4402.62 So I just want to take a couple of minutes
4404.16 and describe the work of
Recanzone and Merzenich,
4406.39 because it's absolutely
fantastic and fascinating.
4410.55 What they did is they had subjects try
4414.36 to learn auditory information,
4416.98 except that they told
them to pay attention
4420.06 to particular frequencies.
4422.44 So now you know what frequencies are
4423.79 so, essentially, high-pitched
sounds or low-pitched sounds.
4428.66 What they found was
just passively listening
4432.34 to a bunch of stuff does not
allow the brain to change
4436.22 and for that stuff to
be remembered at all.
4438.96 That's not a surprise.
4439.97 We've all experienced the phenomenon
4442.66 of having someone talk and
we see their mouth moving
4444.66 and we're like, yeah,
this is really important,
4445.869 this is really important.
4446.71 We're listening. We're trying to listen.
4448.04 And then they walk away and we think
4449.32 I didn't get any of that.
4451.37 And you wonder whether or not it was them,
4453.38 maybe this is happening to you right now.
4455.08 You wonder whether or not it was you,
4457.75 you wonder whether or not you
have trouble with learning
4459.77 or you have attention deficit.
4461.27 It could be any number
of different things.
4463.21 But what Recanzone and
Merzenich discovered
4465.3 was that if you instruct
subjects to listen
4468.52 for particular cues within
speech, or within sounds,
4472.81 that not only can you learn
those things more quickly,
4475.78 but that you can remap these
tonotopic maps in the cortex
4482.11 that I referred to earlier.
4483.17 You actually get changes
in the neural architecture,
4485.47 the neural circuitry in the brain,
4487.02 and this can occur not only very rapidly,
4490.68 but they can occur in the adult brain,
4493.13 which prior to their work was not thought
4495.73 to be amenable to change.
4497.38 It was long thought that neuroplasticity
4499.45 could only occur in the developing brain,
4501.26 but the work of Recanzone and Merzenich
4503.23 in the auditory system
actually was some of the first
4506.82 that really opened up
everybody's eyes and ears
4510.75 to the idea that the brain
can change in adulthood.
4514.1 So here's how this sort
of process would work
4516.127 and how you might apply it.
4518.37 If you are trying to learn music,
4520.58 or you're trying to learn information
4523.56 that you're going to then recite,
4526.62 you can decide to highlight certain words
4529.781 or certain frequencies of sound
4533.67 or certain scales or
certain keys on the piano,
4536.42 and to only focus on those
for certain learning bouts.
4540.27 So I'll give an example
that's real time for me,
4544.35 meaning it's happening right now.
4547.89 I know generally what I want
to say when I arrive here,
4551.37 I even know specifically certain things
4553.32 that I want to make
sure get across to you,
4556.42 but I don't think about every single word
4558.94 that I'm going to say
and the precise order
4561.5 in which I'm going to say those things.
4563.33 That would be actually very disruptive
4565.24 because it wouldn't match
my normal patterns of speech
4567.54 and you'd probably think I
was sounding rather robotic
4570.158 if I were to do that.
4573.24 So one way that we can
remember information
4575.56 is as we write out, for instance,
4577.47 something that we want to say,
4579.19 we can highlight particular
words, we can underline those.
4583.15 If we're listening to somebody
4585.56 and they're telling us information,
4588.81 we can decide just to
highlight particular words
4591.78 that they said to us and write those down.
4594.43 Now, of course, we're listening
to all the information,
4597.02 but the work of Recanzone and Merzenich
4599.9 and the work of others in
addition to his former student
4604.35 or former post-doc, I don't know which,
4606.66 Michael Kilgard who's now
got his own lab down in Texas
4609.58 or others have shown that
the cuing of attention
4612.48 to particular features of speech,
4614.73 particular components of speech,
4617.06 the way in which it increases
our level of attention overall
4620.46 allows us to capture more
of the information overall.
4624.14 And so I don't want this
to be abstract at all.
4626.01 What this means is when you're listening,
4627.9 you don't have to listen to every word.
4630.43 You're already listening to every word.
4632.12 All the information is
coming in through your ears.
4634.41 What you're trying to
extract is particular things
4638.78 or themes within the content.
4640.77 So maybe you decide if
you're listening to me
4642.62 that you're only going to
listen to the word tools,
4646.21 or you're only going to listen
4647.25 to when my voice goes above background,
4649.84 you get to decide what you
decide to listen to or not.
4652.72 And what you decide to
focus on isn't necessarily
4656.14 as important as the fact
that you're focusing.
4659.28 So I hope that's clear.
4660.57 The auditory system does this all the time
4662.84 with the cocktail party effect.
4664.04 What I'm talking about is
exporting certain elements
4666.75 of the mechanisms of the
cocktail party effect,
4669.41 paying attention to the
onset and offset of words
4671.85 or particular notes within
music or particular scales,
4675.55 or you can make it even
broader and particular motifs
4679.56 of music or particular sentences of words
4682.31 or particular phrases.
4683.55 And in doing that, you extract more
4685.91 of the information overall,
4688.32 even though you're not paying attention
4689.53 to all the information at once.
4691.81 Now, I'd like to talk about a phenomenon
4693.46 that you've all experienced
before, which is called Doppler.
4697.95 So the Doppler effect is the
way that we experience sound
4704.34 when the thing that's
making that sound is moving.
4708.92 The simplest way to explain
this is to translate the sound
4712.52 into the visual world once again.
4715.42 So if you've ever seen a
duck or a goose sitting
4719.8 in a pond or a lake and
it's bobbing up and down,
4724.44 what you'll notice is
that the ripples of water
4726.62 that extend out from that duck or goose
4729.4 are fairly regularly
spaced in all directions.
4732.09 And that's because that
duck or goose is stationary.
4734.76 It's moving up and down,
but it's not moving forward
4736.81 or backward or to the side.
4739.01 Now, if that duck or
goose were to swim forward
4742.13 by paddling its little webbed
feet under the surface,
4745.94 you would immediately notice
that the ripples of water
4749.12 that are close to and in
front of that duck or goose
4752.49 would be closer together than
the ones that trailed it,
4755.52 that were behind.
4756.95 And that is essentially what
happens with sound as well.
4760.767 With the Doppler effect,
we experience sounds
4764.7 that are closer to us at higher frequency,
4766.93 the ripples are closer together,
4769.34 and sounds that are further
away at lower frequency,
4772.73 especially when they're moving past us.
4775.04 So if you've ever, for
instance, heard a siren
4778.13 in the distance, [humming]
4787.81 that's essentially my
rendition of a siren,
4790.44 I don't know what ambulance
or police or what,
4792.89 passing you on a street,
that is the Doppler effect.
4797.32 The Doppler effect is one of the main ways
4799.96 that we make out the direction
that things are arriving
4804.63 from and their speeds and trajectories.
4808.05 And we get very good,
from a very young age,
4811.71 at discerning what direction
things are arriving from
4815.33 and the direction that they
are going to pass us in.
4819.35 And the Doppler effect has probably saved
4820.85 your life many, many times.
4823.03 In this way, you just don't realize it
4824.57 because you'll step off the curb
4825.637 or you're driving your car
and you pull to the side
4829.34 so that the ambulance
or firetruck can go by
4832.16 because you heard that
siren off in the distance,
4837.09 and then you pull away from the curb
4838.55 and you get back on the road in part,
4840.45 because you don't see it any longer,
4841.88 but also you don't hear any
other sirens in the distance.
4844.97 Now, some animals such as
bats are exquisitely good
4849.04 at navigating their
environments according to sound.
4851.95 Now, we've all heard that bats don't see.
4855.35 That's actually not true.
4856.4 They actually have vision,
4857.71 but they just rely more heavily
on their auditory system.
4860.38 And the way that bats navigate in the dark
4863.54 and the way that bats navigate using sound
4866.3 is through Doppler.
4867.89 Now, they don't simply listen
to whether or not things
4871.61 are coming at them or
moving away from them
4874.66 and pay attention to the
Doppler like the siren example
4877.33 I gave for you.
4878.94 What they do is they
generate their own sounds.
4882.64 So a bat, as it flies around
is sending out clicks,
4887.857 [Andrew clicks tongue]
4889.13 I think that's my best
bat sound or maybe it's
4890.913 [Andrew clicks tongue]
4892.37 and they're clicking, they're
actually propelling sound out
4895.12 at a particular frequency that they know.
4898.35 Now, whether or not they're
conscious of it, I don't know.
4900.21 I've never asked them.
4901.043 And if I did ask them, I
don't think they could answer.
4902.307 And if they could answer,
they couldn't answer
4903.91 in a language that I could understand.
4905.86 But the bat is essentially flying around,
4908.16 sending out sound waves,
pinging its environment
4911.35 with sound waves of a particular frequency
4913.38 and then depending on the
frequency of sound waves
4915.84 that come back, they know
if they're getting closer
4918.93 to an object or further away from it.
4921.16 So if they send out
sounds at a frequency of,
4924.77 this was much slower than
it would actually occur,
4926.7 but let's say one every
half second, [whining]
4930.75 and it's coming back even faster [roars]
4933.81 then they know they're getting closer
4935.76 because of the Doppler effect.
4938.04 And if it comes back more slowly,
4940.28 they know that there's
nothing in front of them.
4942.31 So the bat is essentially
navigating its world
4945.88 by creating these auras of sound
4949.42 that bounce back on to them
4951.71 from the various objects,
trees, et cetera,
4953.93 buildings and people, it's
kind of eerie to think about.
4956.42 But yes, they see you, they
experience you with their sound,
4959.92 they sense you and they're
using Doppler to accomplish it.
4964.46 Now I'd like to talk
about ringing in the ears.
4968.01 This is something that
I get asked about a lot.
4971.04 And speaking of signal-to-noise,
4973.38 I don't know if I get
asked about it a lot,
4975.58 because many people suffer
from ringing in their ears,
4978.95 or because the people
who suffer from ringing
4981.31 in their ears suffer so much
4983.14 that they are more prone to ask.
4985.51 So it could be a sampling
bias, I don't know,
4988.33 but I've been asked enough times
and some of the experiences
4992.05 of discomfort that people have expressed
4994.38 about having this ringing of the ears
4997.34 really motivated me to go
deep into this literature.
5000.69 So the ringing of the
ears that one experiences
5004.18 is called tinnitus, not
ti-nahy-tus, but tinnitus.
5009.8 And tinnitus can vary in intensity
5012.75 and it can vary according
to stress levels,
5016.25 it can vary across the
lifespan or even time of day.
5020.55 So it's very subject to background effects
5023.41 and contextual effects.
5025.84 So I think we all know
that we should do our best
5028.84 to maximize healthy sleep.
5030.21 We did a number of episodes on that.
5032.07 Essentially, the first four episodes
5033.82 of the Huberman Lab Podcast
were all about sleep
5035.66 and how to get better sleep.
5038.2 We all know that we should
try and limit our stress.
5040.15 And we had an episode about stress
5042.25 and ways to mitigate stress as well.
5045.99 However, there are people, it seems,
5048.47 that are suffering from tinnitus,
5049.89 for which stress or lack of sleep
5052.45 just can't explain the
presence of the tinnitus.
5055.93 Tinnitus can be caused by disruption
5059.65 to these hair cells that
we talked about earlier
5061.61 or damage to the hair cells.
5063.71 So that's another reason why,
5065.23 even if you have good hearing now
5068.46 that you want to protect that hearing
5070.09 and really avoid putting yourself
5072.59 into these two-hit environments,
5074.71 environments where there's
a lot of background noise,
5076.96 and then you add another
really loud auditory stimulus.
5080.99 This also can happen at different
times, I should mention.
5083.57 If you go to a concert or
you listen to loud music
5086.91 with your headphones and
then you go to a concert,
5089.66 or you go into a very
loud work environment,
5092.17 the hair cells can still be vulnerable.
5093.96 And once those hair cells
are knocked out, currently,
5097.12 we don't have the
technology to put them back.
5098.84 Although many groups,
including some excellent groups
5101.14 at Stanford and elsewhere, too, of course,
5103.985 are working on ways to
replenish those hair cells
5107.32 and restore hearing.
5109.84 There are treatments for tinnitus
5111.57 that involve taking certain substances.
5117.39 There are medications for tinnitus.
5119.93 In the non-prescription landscape,
5121.85 which is typically what we
discuss on this podcast,
5124.32 when we discuss taking anything,
5127.66 there are, essentially, four compounds
5129.67 for which there are
quality peer-reviewed data,
5132.62 where there does not appear to
be any overt commercial bias,
5136.91 meaning that nothing's
reported in the papers
5139.1 as funding from a particular company
5141.13 and those are melatonin, Ginkgo
bilboa, zinc and magnesium.
5146.47 Now I've talked about melatonin before.
5149.11 I'm personally not a fan of
melatonin as a sleep aid,
5153.13 but there are four studies,
first one entitled:
5157.22 The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus,
5160.48 tinnitus, excuse me, and Sleep.
5162.7 Second one, Treatment of Central
and Sensory Neural Tinnitus
5165.8 with orally-administered melatonin.
5167.67 And then the title goes on much longer,
5169.66 but it's a randomized study.
5171.6 I'm not going to read out all these.
5172.73 Melatonin: Can it Stop The ringing?
5174.68 which is an interesting
article, double-blinded study,
5177.73 and The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus.
5181.05 Each one of these studies
has anywhere from 30
5183.86 to more than 100 subjects,
in one case 102 subjects;
5188.29 both genders as they list them out,
5191.01 typically, it's listed as
sex, not gender in studies
5194.09 so it should say both
sexes, but nonetheless;
5198.665 an age range anywhere from 30 years old,
5202.62 all the way up to 65 plus.
5204.43 I didn't see any studies
of people younger than 30.
5208.79 All three focused on
melatonin, not surprisingly,
5212.98 because of the titles, looking at a range
5215.5 of dosages anywhere from
three milligrams per day,
5218.65 which is sort of typical of
many supplements for melatonin,
5222.32 still much higher than one
would manufacture endogenously
5226.48 through your own pineal gland,
5228.35 but three milligrams in these studies
5232.34 for a duration of anywhere from 30 days
5235.37 to much longer in some cases, six months.
5239.27 And all four of these studies found modest
5242.72 yet still statistically
significant effects
5245.623 of taking melatonin by mouth,
5248.24 so it's orally-administered melatonin
5251.39 in reducing the severity of tinnitus.
5256.33 So that's compelling, at least to me.
5258.376 It doesn't sound like a cure.
5260.97 And, of course, as always,
I'm not a physician,
5264.46 I'm a scientist, so I
don't prescribe anything.
5266.52 I only profess things, I
report to you the science.
5268.66 You have to decide if
melatonin is right for you
5271.1 if you have tinnitus.
5273.14 And certainly, I say that
both to protect myself,
5276.3 but also protect you.
5277.59 You're responsible for
your health and wellbeing.
5280.04 And I'm not telling anyone to run out
5282.38 and start taking melatonin for tinnitus,
5284.951 but it does seem that
it can have some effects
5287.35 in reducing its symptoms.
5290.41 Ginkgo Boaboa is an interesting compound.
5293.188 It's been prescribed for or recommended
5296.56 for many, many things, but
there are a few studies,
5301.9 again, double-blinded studies
lasting one to six months,
5305.147 one that has have an
impressive number of subjects,
5307.97 978 subjects ranging from
age 18 all the way up to 65
5313.13 so on and so forth that show
not huge effects of Ginkgo,
5320.49 but as they quote,
limited evidence suggests
5323.25 that if tinnitus is a side
effect of something else,
5327.22 in particular, cognitive decline,
5329.47 so age-related tinnitus might
be helped by Ginkgo Boaboa.
5336.84 I won't go through all the
details of the zinc studies,
5339.01 but it seems that zinc supplementation
5340.65 at higher levels than are typical
5342.33 of most people's intakes
of 50 milligrams per day,
5345.32 do appear to be able to
reduce subjective symptoms
5347.5 of tinnitus in most of the people
5350.0 that took the supplemented zinc.
5351.75 There aren't a lot of studies on that.
5353.9 So I could only find one
double-blinded study.
5356.84 It lasted anywhere from one to six months,
5358.75 41 subjects, both genders
listed out again here, 45 to 64,
5363.43 and they saw a decrease in the
severity of tinnitus symptoms
5366.913 with 50 milligrams of
elemental zinc supplementation.
5371.19 And then last but not least
is the magnesium study.
5374.37 Again, only a single study.
5376.41 It's a Phase II study looking
5378.75 at a fairly limited number of subjects,
5381.03 so only 19 subjects taking 532 milligrams
5385.16 of elemental magnesium.
5386.5 For those of you that take magnesium,
5387.76 there's magnesium and elemental magnesium,
5389.6 and it's always translated on the bottle,
5392.32 but it was associated with
a lessening of symptoms
5394.8 related to tinnitus.
5396.09 So for you tinnitus sufferers out there,
5399.77 you may already be aware of this,
5401.23 you may already be taking these things
5403.386 and had no positive effects,
5406.31 meaning they didn't help, maybe not.
5408.47 I hope that you'll, at
least, consider these,
5411.57 talk to your doctor about them.
5413.16 I do realize that tinnitus
is extremely disruptive.
5416.3 I can't say I empathize because I don't,
5420.09 from a place of experience, that is,
5421.54 because I don't have tinnitus,
5422.69 but for those of you that
don't include myself,
5424.67 you can imagine that
hearing sounds of things
5427.62 that aren't there and
the ringing in one's ears
5429.51 can be very disruptive and I
think would be very disruptive
5433.03 and explains why people with
tinnitus reach out so often
5436.34 with questions about
how to alleviate that.
5438.41 And I hope this information
was useful to you.
5440.87 I'd like to now talk about
balance and our sense of balance,
5444.84 which is controlled by, believe it or not,
5448.08 our ears and things in our ears,
5451.0 as well as by our brain and
elements of our spinal cord.
5455.59 But before I do that, I want
to ask you another question
5458.19 or I would rather, I'd like
to ask you to ask yourself
5461.85 a question and answer it,
which is how big are your ears.
5467.26 It turns out that the
ears grow our entire life.
5471.98 In the early stage of our
life, they grow more slowly.
5475.43 And then as we age,
they grow more quickly.
5479.15 You may have noticed if
you have family members
5482.14 who are well into their 70s and 80s,
5485.038 and if you're fortunate, into their 90s
5488.847 and maybe even 100s, is that the ears
5492.2 of some of these individuals
get very, very big,
5495.2 relative to their previous ear sizes.
5498.586 So it turns out that biological age
5501.47 can actually be measured
according to ear size.
5506.21 Now you have to take a few
measurements but there's,
5508.35 believe it or not, there is a formula
5510.43 in the scientific literature,
5513.91 if you know your ear circumference,
5516.6 so the distance around
your ear, ears, plural,
5521.34 presumably you have two, most people do,
5524.44 in millimeters, so you're
going to take the circumference
5527.51 of your ears in millimeters.
5528.47 How would you do this?
5530.17 How would you do this?
5531.07 Maybe you take a string and
you put it around your ear,
5534.34 and then you measure the string.
5535.45 That's probably going to be
easier than marching around
5538.11 your ear or somebody
else's ear with a ruler
5540.42 and measuring in millimeters.
5541.61 So what's your ear
circumference, on the outside,
5544.81 don't go in on the divot or anything.
5546.41 You're just going around
as if you're going to trace
5548.07 the closest fitting oval,
5550.91 assuming your ears are
oval, closest fitting oval
5553.91 that matches your ear circumference.
5557.02 Take that number in
millimeters, subtract from it...
5560.95 Oh, excuse me, I should do this correctly.
5563.27 Do that for both ears, add them together,
5566.08 add those numbers together, divide by two,
5567.89 get the average for your two ears,
5570.16 get your average ear circumference,
5571.85 of course, your two ears.
5573.56 Then take that number in millimeters,
5575.96 subtract 88.1 and then
whatever value that is,
5581.44 multiply it times 1.96
5584.4 and that will tell you
your biological age.
5587.4 Now why in the world
would this be accurate?
5592.0 As we age, there are changes in number
5594.13 of different biological pathways.
5597.66 One of those pathways
is the pathways related
5599.73 to collagen synthesis.
5601.78 So not only are our ears growing,
5604.57 but our noses are growing too,
5606.717 and my nose seems to be growing a lot.
5608.93 But then again, I did
sports where I would get
5610.46 my nose broken, something
I don't recommend.
5612.51 As I always point out, you don't get
5613.46 a nose like mine doing
yoga, but nonetheless,
5617.27 my nose is still growing and
my ears are still growing.
5619.59 And I suspect as I get older,
5621.22 if I have the good fortune of
living into my 80s and 90s,
5625.03 my ears are going to continue to grow.
5627.34 A comparison between chronological
age and biological age
5630.24 is something that's a really
deep interest these days
5632.38 in the work of David Sinclair
5634.28 at Harvard Medical School and others.
5637.53 So called Horvath clocks
that people have developed
5641.03 have tapped into how the
epigenome and the genome
5643.908 can give us some insight
into our biological age
5647.85 and how that compares to
our chronological age.
5649.83 Most of us know our chronological age,
5652.02 because we know when we were born
5653.89 and we know where we are
relative to that now.
5656.95 But you can start to make a little chart,
5661.09 if you like, about your
rates of ear growth.
5663.89 Your rates of ear growth
actually correlate pretty well
5666.38 with your rates of biological progression
5669.67 through this thing that we call life.
5672.49 So it's not something that
we think about too often,
5674.72 but just like our DNA and our epigenome,
5678.83 and some other markers of metabolic health
5681.48 and hormone health relate to our age,
5683.97 so does our collagen synthesis.
5686.04 And one of the places
that shows up the most
5687.738 is in these two little goodies
on the sides of our heads,
5690.28 which are our ears.
5691.76 So even though it's a little
bit of a bizarre metric,
5694.91 it makes perfect sense in
the biological context.
5697.69 So let's talk about balance
5699.22 and how to get better at balancing.
5701.7 The reason why we're talking about balance
5703.33 and how to get better at balancing
5705.0 in the episode about hearing
is that all the goodies
5708.93 that are going to allow you
to do that are in your ears.
5713.83 They're also in your brain, but
they're mostly in your ears.
5717.73 So as you recall from the
beginning of this episode,
5719.96 you have two cochlea, cochleas,
5722.8 that are one on each side of your head.
5725.63 And that's a little
spiral snail-shaped thing
5727.81 that converts sound waves
into electrical signals
5730.68 that the rest of your
brain can understand.
5733.39 Right next to those,
5734.71 you have what are called
semicircular canals.
5738.94 The semicircular canals
can be best visualized
5741.46 as thinking about three hula
hoops with marbles in them.
5745.38 So imagine that you have a hula hoop
5748.36 and it's not filled with
marbles all the way around,
5751.42 it's just got some marbles
down there at the base.
5754.91 So if you were to move
that hula hoop around,
5757.31 the marbles would move around, [shushing].
5760.89 You've got three of those and
each one of those hula hoops
5763.3 has these marbles that can move around.
5766.75 One of those hula hoops
is positioned vertically
5771.47 with respect to gravity.
5772.8 So it's basically parallel to your nose.
5775.57 It sits like this, if
you're watching on a video,
5777.57 but basically it's upright.
5779.2 Another one of those
hula hoops is basically
5782.935 at a 90-degree angle to your nose.
5787.36 It's basically parallel to the floor
5789.77 if you're standing up right
now, if you're seated.
5793.52 And the other one, it's kind of tilted
5797.25 about 45 degrees in between those.
5800.17 Now why is the system there?
5802.9 Well, those marbles within
each one of those hula hoops
5805.31 can move around, but
they'll only move around
5809.76 if your head moves in a particular way,
5811.72 and there are three planes or three ways
5814.56 that your head can move.
5816.34 Your head can move up and down
like I'm nodding right now.
5820.11 So that's called pitch,
5821.66 it's pitching forward or pitching back.
5825.74 So it's a nod, up and down,
5828.52 or I can shake my head no, side to side.
5831.57 That's called a yaw.
5832.94 You pilots will be very
familiar with this, yaw.
5836.04 Not yawn, yaw.
5838.28 And then there's roll, tilting
the head from side to side,
5842.26 the way that a cute
puppy might look at you
5844.83 from side to side or that if somebody
5847.36 doesn't really understand or
believe what you're saying,
5850.7 they might tilt their head,
very common phenomenon.
5854.26 I mean, nobody does that to me,
5855.55 but they do that to each other.
5857.69 So pitch, yaw and roll are
the movements of the head
5861.96 in each of the three major
planes of motion, as we say.
5865.38 And each one of those causes those marbles
5869.01 to move in one or two of
the various hula hoops.
5874.53 So if I move my head
up and down when I nod,
5877.25 one of those hula hoops,
literally, right now,
5880.07 the marbles are moving back and forth.
5881.42 They aren't actually marbles by the way,
5883.22 these are little, kind of
like little stones, basically,
5888.33 little calcium-like deposits
5891.02 and when they roll back and forth,
5893.82 they deflect little hairs,
5896.79 little hair cells that
aren't like the hair cells
5898.93 that we use for measuring sound waves.
5901.04 They're not too different, but
they are different from them,
5904.6 not like the hairs on our heads,
5907.07 but they're basically rolling past
5909.3 these little hair cells
and causing them to deflect
5912.6 and when they deflect
downward, the neurons,
5915.765 because hair cells are neurons,
5917.34 send information up to the brain.
5920.73 So if I move my head like this,
5922.52 there's a physical movement
of these little stones
5925.57 in this hula hoop as I'm referring to it,
5928.43 but they deflect these
hairs, send those hairs,
5931.74 which are neurons, those hair cells,
5933.46 send information off to the brain.
5934.93 If I move my head from side to side,
5936.65 different little stones move.
5938.63 If I roll my head, different stones move.
5940.89 This is an exquisite system
that exists in all animals
5944.92 that have a jaw.
5947.55 So any fish that has
a jaw has this system,
5950.61 a puppy has the system,
5952.3 any animal that has a jaw has
this so-called balance system,
5956.12 which we call the vestibular system.
5958.29 One of the more important things to know
5960.12 about the vestibular, the balance system
5962.5 is that it works together
with the visual system.
5968.1 Let's say I hear something off to my left
5970.04 and I swing my head over to
the left to see what it is.
5974.165 There are two sources of
information about where my head is
5977.13 relative to my body and
I need to know that.
5979.97 First of all, when I quickly
move my head to the side,
5983.93 those little stones, as
I'm referring to them,
5986.41 I realize they're not actually stones,
5987.77 but as I'm referring to them,
5989.44 they quickly, whoom,
activate those hair cells
5992.41 in that one semicircular canal,
5994.93 and send a signal off to my brain
5996.91 that my head just moved
to the side like this,
5998.76 not that it went like
this and pitched back
6000.67 or not that it tilted, but
it just moved to the side.
6003.97 But also visual information
slid past my field of view.
6008.75 I didn't have to think about it,
6009.75 but just slid past my field of view.
6011.67 And when those two signals combine,
6015.72 my eyes then lock to
a particular location.
6018.63 Now, if this is at all complicated,
6021.27 you can actually uncouple these things.
6023.82 It's very easy to do. You
can do this right now.
6026.21 In fact, I'd like you
to do this experiment
6027.91 if you're not already doing something else
6029.61 that requires your attention.
6030.84 And certainly, don't do
this if you're driving.
6033.106 You're going to sit down and
you're going to move your head
6037.22 to the left very slowly
with your eyes open.
6042.09 So you're going to move
it very, very slowly.
6045.39 The whole thing should
take about five, six,
6047.46 maybe even 10 seconds to complete.
6052.15 Okay, I just did it.
6053.72 Now, I'm going to do it very quickly.
6054.98 I'd like you to do it
very quickly as well.
6058.35 Now do it slowly again.
6064.27 What you probably noticed
6065.78 is that it's very
uncomfortable to do it slowly,
6069.44 but you can do it very quickly
6072.07 without much discomfort at all.
6073.39 You just move your head to the side.
6074.97 The reason is when you move
your head, very slowly,
6078.81 those little stones at the
base of that hula hoop,
6082.03 they don't get enough momentum to move.
6084.06 So you're actually not
generating this signal
6087.57 to the brain that your head is moving.
6089.23 And what you'll notice is
that your eyes have to go,
6091.677 boom, boom, boom, jumping
over step-by-step.
6095.33 Whereas if you move your
head really quickly,
6097.29 the signal gets off to
your brain and your eyes
6098.94 just go boom, right to the
location you want to look at.
6101.88 So moving your body slowly
is actually very disruptive
6106.32 to the vestibular system.
6108.96 And it's very disruptive
to your visual system.
6112.31 Now, if you've ever had the misfortune
6113.68 of being on a boat and you're
going through big oscillations
6116.69 on the boat, for those of you seasick,
6117.842 folks that get seasick,
6119.69 this can actually make
certain people seasick
6121.51 just to hear about it,
those big oscillations
6124.62 going up and down and up and down.
6127.04 Those are very disruptive.
6128.37 We'll talk about nausea in a minute
6130.06 and how to offset that kind of nausea.
6132.1 I get pretty seasick, but there are ways
6133.56 that you can deal with
this but this is incredible
6137.5 because what it means is
a purely physical system
6139.36 of these little stones
rolling around in there
6142.23 and directing where your eyes should go.
6144.96 So you can do this also
just by looking up.
6147.18 So let's just say, you're
sitting in a chair,
6149.24 you're going to look
up towards the ceiling
6151.04 and your eyes will just go there.
6152.32 You're doing this eyes
open and you look down.
6154.23 Now try doing it right
really, really slowly.
6162.02 Some people even get
motion sick doing this,
6164.29 which if you do, then just stop.
6166.24 Okay, so you can do this also to the side,
6169.12 although it works best if
you're moving your head
6170.451 from side to side and
we're nodding up and down.
6175.37 So what we're doing
here is we're uncoupling
6177.44 these two mechanisms,
we're pulling them apart,
6179.19 the visual part and the vestibular part,
6180.97 just to illustrate to you that, normally,
6183.78 these mechanisms in your
inner ear tell your eyes
6187.7 where to go, but as well,
6190.0 your eyes tell your balance
system, your vestibular system,
6194.07 how to function.
6195.45 So I'd like you to do
a different experiment.
6198.05 I'm not going to do it right
now, but basically stand up.
6201.57 If you get the opportunity,
you can do this safely,
6203.26 wherever you are, you're going to stand up
6205.12 and you're going to look
forward about 10, 12 feet.
6208.02 Pick a point on a wall or you can,
6209.901 anywhere that you like,
if you're out in public,
6212.67 just do it anyway.
6213.71 Just tell them you're listening
to Huberman Lab Podcasts,
6216.838 and someone's telling you to do it.
6218.94 Anyway, if you don't want
to do it, don't do it.
6220.32 But, basically, do it.
6221.54 Stand on one leg and
lift up the other leg.
6225.16 You can bend your knee, if you like
6226.58 and just look off into the
distance about 10, 12 feet.
6231.55 If you can do that, if
you can stand on one leg,
6233.6 now close your eyes,
chances are you're going
6237.09 to suddenly feel what
scientists call postural sway.
6240.41 You're going to start
swaying around a lot.
6242.52 It is very hard to balance
with your eyes closed.
6246.634 And if you think about that,
it's like, why is that?
6249.13 That's crazy.
6250.1 Why would it be that it's hard to balance
6251.95 with your eyes closed?
6252.783 Well, information about the
visual world also feeds back
6256.634 onto this vestibular system.
6258.76 So the vestibular system
informs your vision
6260.77 and tells you where to move your eyes
6262.16 and your eyes and their positioning tell
6264.75 your balance system,
your vestibular system
6267.03 how it should function.
6268.7 So there's a really cool way
6271.07 that you can learn to optimize balance.
6273.73 You're not going to try
and do this by learning
6275.37 to balance with your eyes closed.
6277.33 What you can do is you can raise one leg
6281.08 and you can look at a short distance,
6283.04 maybe off to just the distance
that your thumb would be
6285.27 if you were to reach your
arm out in front of you.
6286.73 Although you don't necessarily have to put
6288.29 your thumb in front of you.
6289.123 So maybe just about two
feet in front of you.
6291.57 Then while still balancing,
6292.74 you're going to step your
vision out a further distance,
6296.26 and then a further distance
6297.45 and as far as you can possibly see
6298.87 in the environment that you're in.
6300.45 And then you're going
to march it back to you.
6303.24 Now, what the literature shows
6305.57 is that this kind of balance training
6307.59 where you incorporate the
visual system and extending out,
6312.409 and then marching back in the point
6314.62 at which you direct your visual focus,
6316.93 sends robust information
about the relationship
6320.51 between your visual world
and your balance system.
6323.793 And, of course, the
balance system includes
6325.49 not just these hula hoops,
these semicircular canals,
6328.59 but they communicate with the cerebellum,
6330.47 the so-called mini-brain,
it actually means mini-brain
6332.7 in the back of your brain,
6333.93 combines that with visual information
6335.47 and your map of the body surface.
6339.13 That pattern of training
is very beneficial
6344.53 for enhancing your ability to balance
6347.36 because the ability to balance
6349.19 is, in part, the activation of
particular postural muscles,
6353.35 but just as much, perhaps even moreso,
6357.25 it's about being able to
adjust those postural muscles,
6362.5 excuse me, it's about the ability
6363.688 to adjust those postural muscles
6365.671 as you experience changes
in your visual world.
6368.77 And one of the most robust ways
6370.64 that you can engage changes
in your visual world
6373.37 is through your own movement.
6375.2 And so most people are not trying
6376.87 to balance in place, right?
6379.3 They're not just trying to stand there
6380.6 like a statue on one leg.
6382.27 Most of what we think about
when we think about balance
6384.22 is for sake of sport or dynamic balance
6386.8 of being able to break ourselves,
6389.09 when we're lunging in
one particular direction
6390.87 to stop ourselves, that is,
6392.22 and then to move in another direction
6393.96 or for skateboarding or surfing or cycling
6396.74 or any number of different
things, gymnastics.
6399.21 So the visual system is the primary input
6401.97 by which you develop balance,
6403.37 but you can't do it just
with the visual system.
6406.49 So what I'm recommending
is if you're interested
6409.34 in cultivating a sense of balance,
6410.73 understand the relationship
between the semicircular canals,
6414.47 understand that they are
both driving eye movements
6418.85 and they are driven by eye movements.
6421.13 It's a reciprocal relationship.
6423.1 And then even just two
or three minutes a day,
6426.54 or every once in a while,
even three times a week,
6430.04 maybe five minutes, maybe
10 minutes, you pick,
6433.54 but if you want to enhance balance,
6434.86 you have to combine changes
in your visual environment
6438.9 with a static posture, standing on one leg
6441.23 and shifting your visual
environment or static visual view,
6448.36 looking at one thing and
changing your body posture.
6452.44 So those two things,
6453.69 we now know from the
scientific literature,
6456.047 combine in order to give an
enhanced sense of balance.
6459.07 And there's a really nice paper
that was published in 2015
6462.65 called Effects of Balance
Training on Balance Performance.
6465.59 This was in healthy adults.
6467.98 It's a systematic review
and a meta analysis.
6471.04 A meta analysis is when you combine
6472.67 a lot of literature from
a lot of different papers
6474.69 and extract the really robust
6476.68 and the less robust statistical effects.
6479.33 So it's a really nice paper as well.
6482.12 There are some papers
out there, for instance,
6484.96 comparison of static balance
6486.81 and the role of vision
in the elite athletes.
6489.4 This is essentially the paper
6490.84 that I've extracted
most of the information
6492.376 that I just gave you from.
6494.57 And that paper, and there
are some others as well,
6498.24 but basically I distilled them down
6499.86 into their core components.
6500.86 The core components are
move your vision around
6503.94 while staying static, still
6506.9 but in a balanced position
like standing on one leg,
6509.37 could be something more complicated
6510.68 if you're somebody who can do
more complicated movements.
6514.72 Unilateral movement
seemed to be important,
6517.2 so standing on one leg as opposed to both,
6520.43 or trying to generate
some tilt is another way
6524.04 to go about it or imbalance,
6525.45 meaning one limb
asymmetrically being activated
6528.14 compared to the other limb.
6529.83 And then the other way to encourage
6532.81 or to cultivate and build
up this vestibular system
6536.74 and your sense of balance
actually involves movement itself,
6540.43 acceleration.
6541.48 So that's what we're
going to talk about now.
6543.49 So up until now, I've
been talking about balance
6545.37 only in the static sense,
6546.73 like standing on one leg for instance,
6548.47 but that's a very artificial situation.
6551.09 Even though you can
train balance that way,
6553.21 most people who want to
enhance their sense of balance
6555.84 for sport or dance, or
some other endeavor,
6558.83 want to engage balance in a dynamic way,
6561.55 meaning moving through lots of
different planes of movement,
6564.22 maybe even sometimes
while squatting down low
6566.9 or jumping and landing
or making trajectories
6570.13 that are different angles.
6572.73 For that, we need to consider
6574.49 that the vestibular system
also cares about acceleration.
6579.248 So it cares about head position,
6581.01 it cares about eye position
and where the eyes are
6583.58 and where you're looking,
but it also cares
6585.66 about what direction
you're moving and how fast.
6589.43 And one of the best things that you can do
6592.46 to enhance your sense of balance
6594.9 is to start to bring
together your visual system,
6599.44 the semicircular canals of the inner ear
6602.33 and what we call linear acceleration.
6605.11 So if I move forward in
space rigidly upright,
6608.92 it's a vastly different situation
6611.04 than if I'm leaning to the side.
6614.64 One of the best ways to cultivate
6617.45 a better sense of balance, literally,
6620.28 within the sense organs and the neurons
6623.03 and the biology of the
brain is to get into modes
6627.99 where we are accelerating
forward, typically,
6631.08 it's forward while also tilted
with respect to gravity.
6635.68 Now this would be the
carve on a skateboard
6638.51 or on a surf board or a snowboard.
6640.76 This would be the taking
a corner on a bike
6644.28 while being able to
lean, safely, of course,
6646.81 lean into the turn so that your head
6649.31 is actually tilted with
respect to the earth.
6652.89 So anytime that we are rigidly upright,
6655.78 we aren't really exercising the
vestibular system imbalance.
6660.42 And this is why you see people in the gym
6662.38 on these, one of those bouncy balls,
6664.71 Bocce balls are the one that
the guys roll in the park.
6667.52 Bouncy balls, where they're
balancing back and forth,
6669.313 that will work the small
stabilizing muscles.
6671.94 But what I'm talking about
is getting into modes
6673.87 where you actually tilt
the body and the head
6677.28 with respect to earth.
6680.58 What I mean is with respect
to Earth's gravitational pull.
6684.11 Now the cerebellum is a
very interesting structure
6687.37 because not only is it
involved in balance,
6689.85 but it's also involved in skill-learning
6693.04 and in generating timing of movements.
6695.97 It's a fascinating structure deserving
6697.68 of an entire episode or several
episodes all on its own,
6701.8 but some of the outputs of the cerebellum,
6705.0 meaning the neurons in
the cerebellum get inputs,
6707.85 but they also send information out.
6710.52 The outputs of the cerebellum
are strongly linked
6713.4 to areas of the brain that
release neuromodulators
6716.56 that make us feel really
good, in particular,
6719.56 serotonin and dopamine.
6721.35 And this is an early emerging
sub-field within neuroscience,
6724.666 but a lot of what are
called the non-motor outputs
6727.91 of the cerebellum have
a profound influence,
6731.23 not just on our ability to
learn how to balance better,
6735.67 but also how we feel overall.
6738.46 So for you exercisers out there,
6740.77 I do hope people are getting
6741.847 regular healthy amounts of exercise.
6743.93 We've talked about what that
means in previous episodes,
6746.59 so at least 150 minutes
a week of endurance work,
6749.12 some strength training,
6749.953 a minimum five sets per body
part to maintain musculature
6753.37 even if you don't want to grow muscles,
6754.91 you want to do that in
order to maintain healthy,
6756.94 strengthened bones, et cetera.
6759.48 If you're doing that but
you're only doing things
6762.58 like curls in the gym, squats in the gym,
6764.75 riding the Peloton, or even
if you're outside running,
6767.48 and you're getting forward acceleration,
6769.48 but you're never actually getting tilted,
6771.36 you're never actually getting tilted
6772.85 with respect to Earth's
gravitational pull,
6776.44 you're not really exercising
and getting the most
6781.25 out of your nervous system.
6783.22 Activation of the cerebellum in this way
6786.72 of being tilted or the head being tilted
6788.98 and the body being tilted
while in acceleration,
6791.34 typically forward acceleration,
6793.01 but sometimes side to side has a profound
6796.82 and positive effect on our
sense of mood and wellbeing.
6800.2 And as I talked about in previous episode,
6802.88 it can also enhance our
ability to learn information
6806.22 in the period after
generating those tilts.
6809.64 And the acceleration.
6811.38 And that's because the
cerebellum has these outputs
6813.84 to these areas of the brain
6814.89 that release these neuromodulators,
6816.49 like serotonin and dopamine.
6818.8 And they make us feel really good.
6821.46 I think this is one of the
reasons why, growing up,
6824.19 I had some friends, some
of whom might've been
6826.628 the world heavyweight
champions of laziness
6830.27 for essentially everything,
6832.17 except they would wake up at
4:30 in the morning to go surf.
6836.34 They would drive, they would
get up so early to go surf.
6840.11 It's not just surfers and
some surfers, by the way,
6842.45 I should point out are not lazy humans.
6844.73 They do a lot of other things.
6846.07 But I knew people that couldn't
be motivated to do anything,
6848.97 but they were highly driven
to get into these experiences
6853.16 of forward acceleration while tilted
6855.24 with respect to gravity,
6856.61 likewise, with snowboarding
or skiing or cycling.
6861.15 Those modes of exercise seem
to have an outsized effect
6865.85 both on our wellbeing and our ability
6868.42 to translate the vestibular
balance that we achieve
6872.53 in those endeavors to
our ability to balance
6875.25 while doing other things,
6876.77 and I don't mean psychological
balance necessarily.
6879.71 I mean physical balance.
6881.59 So for those of you that
don't think of yourselves
6883.49 as very coordinated or
with very good balance,
6887.01 getting into these modes of
acceleration forward movement
6889.88 or lateral movement while getting tilted,
6891.76 even if you have to do it
slowly, could be beneficial,
6894.26 I do believe, and the
scientific literature points
6896.087 to the fact that it will be beneficial
6898.75 for cultivating better
sense of physical balance.
6902.54 It can really build up the circuits
6904.47 of this vestibular system.
6906.32 And then, of course,
the feel-good components
6908.82 of acceleration while tilted
or while getting the head
6912.38 into different orientations
relative to gravity,
6915.858 well, that's the explanation
for roller-coasters.
6918.78 Some people hate roller-coasters.
6920.08 They make them feel nauseous.
6921.99 Many people love roller-coasters
6924.87 and one of the reasons
they love roller-coasters
6926.75 is because of the way that
when you get the body,
6930.33 even if you're not
generating the movement,
6931.93 you get the body into forward acceleration
6934.03 and you're going upside
down and tilted to the side
6936.54 as the tracks go from side
to side and tilt, et cetera,
6939.27 you're getting activation
of these deeper brain nuclei
6942.84 that trigger the release
of neuromodulators
6945.31 that just make us feel
really, really good.
6947.23 In fact, some people get a long arc,
6949.45 a long duration buzz from having gone
6951.87 through those experiences.
6953.12 Some people who hate roller-coasters
6954.464 are probably getting nauseous,
just hearing about that.
6958.0 So I encourage people to get
into modes of acceleration
6961.77 while tilted every once in a while,
6963.32 provided you can do it safely.
6964.71 It's an immensely powerful
way to build up your skills
6968.59 in the realm of balance.
6970.16 And it's also, for most
people, very, very pleasing.
6974.07 It feels really good because
of the chemical relationship
6976.66 between forward acceleration
and head tilt and body tilt.
6981.23 Now, speaking of feeling nauseous,
6984.93 some people suffer from vertigo.
6987.27 Some people feel dizzy,
some people get lightheaded.
6991.41 An important question
to ask yourself, always,
6993.95 if you're feeling quote-unquote
dizzy or lightheaded,
6996.56 is are you dizzy or are you lightheaded?
6999.66 Now, we're not going to
diagnose anything here
7001.74 because there's just
no way we can do that.
7003.47 This is essentially me
shouting into a tunnel.
7005.35 So we don't know what's going on
7006.83 with each and every one of you
7008.28 but if ever you feel that
your world is spinning,
7013.2 but that you can focus on
your thumb, for instance,
7016.55 but the rest of the world is spinning
7018.61 and your thumb is stationary,
that's called being dizzy.
7022.81 Now, if you feel like you're falling
7025.19 or that you feel like you need to get down
7027.21 onto the ground because
you feel light-headed,
7030.45 that's being light-headed.
7032.08 And, oftentimes, with
language we don't distinguish
7034.38 between being dizzy and being lightheaded.
7036.62 Now there are a lot of ways that dizziness
7039.21 and lightheadedness can occur.
7041.03 And I don't even want to
begin to guess at the number
7042.87 of different things and
ways that it could happen
7045.53 for those of you that suffer from it
7046.78 because it could be any number of them.
7048.96 But, oftentimes, if people
are lightheaded, yes,
7052.26 it could be low blood sugar.
7053.24 It could also be that you're dehydrated.
7055.86 It could also be that you
are low in electrolytes.
7058.77 We talked about this
in a previous episode,
7060.71 but we will talk about it
more in a future episode.
7063.33 Many people have too little
sodium in their system, salt,
7066.96 and that's why they feel lightheaded.
7069.38 I have family members who, for years,
7071.26 thought they had disrupted blood sugar.
7073.82 They would get shaky,
jittery, lightheaded,
7076.98 feel like they were nauseous, et cetera.
7079.19 And simply the addition of little sea salt
7082.21 to their water remedied
the problem entirely.
7084.36 I don't think it's going
to remedy every issue
7086.71 of lightheadedness out
there by any stretch,
7088.98 but just the addition of
salt, in this particular case,
7092.06 helped the person.
7092.94 And they are not alone.
7094.64 Many people who think that
they have low blood sugar,
7096.48 actually are lightheaded
because of low electrolytes
7099.58 and because of the way
that salt carries water
7102.96 into the system and creates
changes in blood volume,
7105.5 et cetera.
7106.85 Low sodium can often be a
source of lightheadedness
7110.5 as can low blood sugar and, of course,
7112.34 other things as well.
7113.47 Now for dizziness or seasickness,
7116.04 we were all taught that
you need to pick a point
7118.92 on the horizon and focus on it.
7121.74 But actually, that's not correct.
7125.8 It is true that if you are
down in the cabin of a boat
7129.5 or you're on the lower
deck and all you can see
7132.07 are things up close to you,
7134.81 that getting sloshed around, like so
7137.28 or the boat going up and down, like so,
7139.88 I think I'm getting a little
seasick, even as I do this
7141.497 and I describe it,
7146.27 focusing on things close
to you can be problematic.
7149.16 And in that case, the
advice to go up on deck
7152.42 and get fresh air and to
look off into the horizon,
7155.94 that part is correct.
7157.63 But focusing your eyes
on a particular location
7160.06 on the horizon is effectively like trying
7163.11 to move very slowly as
I had you do before,
7166.3 where you're trying to
move your head very slowly
7168.28 while fixating on one location.
7170.53 Your eyes and your balance
system were designed
7172.41 to move together.
7173.97 So really, what you want to
do is allow your visual system
7176.83 to track with your vestibular system.
7180.26 This is why sitting in the
back of an Uber or a taxi
7183.47 and being on your phone
7185.34 can make you suddenly feel very nauseous.
7187.75 Sometimes the cabs,
particularly in New York City,
7189.73 they have a lot of occluders,
7191.05 they have a lot of stuff
blocking your field of view.
7193.22 There's usually a little
portal where you can see out
7195.66 to the front of the front windshield,
7199.27 but there's all this stuff now,
7200.34 televisions in the back
seat and you're watching
7202.36 that television and the cab is moving.
7204.15 You're in linear acceleration,
7205.902 and sometimes you're taking
corners, you're braking
7209.05 so then your vestibular
system has to adjust to that.
7211.71 If you're looking at your phone or a book,
7214.54 or even if you're talking
to somebody, actually,
7217.28 I'm starting to feel a little nauseous
7218.38 just talking about it.
7219.213 I promise I'm not going
to finish this episode
7220.93 by vomiting at the end, at least not here,
7223.9 but what can happen is
that you're uncoupling
7227.798 the visual information from your motion,
7231.14 from your vestibular information.
7232.88 You want those to be coupled.
7234.2 This is why a lot of people have to drive,
7236.96 they can't be in the passenger seat.
7238.44 Because when you drive,
7239.273 you also get what's called
proprioceptive feedback.
7241.52 Your body is sending signals
also to the vestibular system
7244.95 about where you are in space.
7246.91 When you're the passenger,
7248.1 you're just getting jolted
around as the person is driving.
7251.16 And if you're looking at
your phone, it's even worse.
7253.37 And if you're looking at the occluder
7254.7 between you and the two front
seats, that's even worse.
7258.71 So this is why staring out
the front windshield is great
7261.4 but you don't want to fixate.
7262.76 So, hopefully, I spared a
few people and, hopefully,
7266.45 a few cab drivers of
having people get sick
7268.51 in their cars or Ubers.
7271.33 Let your visual system
7272.41 and your vestibular system work together.
7275.36 If appropriate, get into
linear acceleration,
7278.6 and you'll improve your sense of balance.
7280.85 Once again, we've covered
7282.01 a tremendous amount of information.
7283.841 Now, you know how you hear,
7285.98 how you make sense of the
sounds in your environment,
7289.59 how those come into your ears
7291.13 and how your brain processes them.
7293.44 In addition, we talked about things
7295.12 like low level white noise
and even binaural beats,
7298.14 which can be used to enhance
certain brain states,
7300.78 certain rhythms within the brain,
7302.38 and even dopamine release in ways
7304.61 that allow you to learn better.
7306.84 And we talked about the balance system
7308.337 and this incredible relationship
7309.955 between your vestibular apparatus,
7312.98 meaning the portions of your inner ear
7315.21 that are responsible for balance
7316.55 and your visual system and gravity.
7319.58 And you can use those to
enhance your learning as well,
7322.83 as well as just to enhance
your sense of balance.

7349.75 During this episode, I
mentioned some supplements.
7352.13 We partnered with Thorne because Thorne
7353.83 has the very highest levels of stringency
7355.87 with respect to the quality
of their ingredients
7358.31 and accuracy about the amounts
7360.21 of those ingredients contained
within their products.
7363.0 If you'd like to see the
products that I take from Thorne,
7365.52 you can go to T-H-O-R-N-E
dot com, slash the letter U
7369.83 slash Huberman.
