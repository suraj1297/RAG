0.35 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
1.91 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.94 for everyday life.
6.539 [upbeat rock music]
9.18 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.08 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology at
12.89 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.77 Today, my guest is Dr. Wendy Suzuki.
17.32 Dr. Suzuki is a professor of
neuroscience and psychology
20.16 at New York University and
one of the leading researchers
23.13 in the area of learning and memory.
25.42 Her laboratory has contributed fundamental
27.57 textbook understanding of how brain areas
30.02 such as the hippocampus, which
you will learn about today,
32.96 how the hippocampus and
related brain circuits allow us
36.47 to take certain experiences
and commit them to memory
39.21 so that we can use that
information in the future.
41.78 Dr. Suzuki is also an
expert public educator
45.08 in the realm of science.
46.72 A few years back, she had a TED talk
49.28 that essentially went viral.
50.78 If you haven't seen it
already, you should absolutely
52.71 check it out in which she
describes her experience
55.7 using exercise as a way to
enhance learning and memory.
60.32 And on the basis of that
personal experience,
62.68 she reshaped her laboratory
to explore how things
65.67 like meditation,
exercise, and other things
68.74 that we can do with our
physiology and our psychology
71.6 can allow us to learn faster,
73.62 to commit things to memory longer,
75.86 and, indeed, to reshape
our cognitive performance
78.47 in a variety of settings.
80.41 As such, I am delighted to
announce that Dr. Suzuki
83.66 is now not only running a
laboratory at New York University,
86.97 but she is the incoming
Dean of Arts and Science
89.34 at New York University.
91.02 And of course she was
selected for that role
92.69 for her many talents, but
one of the important aspects
96.03 of her program, she
tells me, is going to be
98.5 to incorporate the incredible
power of exercise, meditation,
102.86 and other behavioral practices
for enhancing learning,
106.1 for improving stress
management, and other things
109.08 to optimize student performance.
110.8 Today, you are going to get access to much
113.5 of that information so that
you can apply those tools
116.15 in your daily life, as well.
118.11 Dr. Suzuki is also an author
of several important books.
121.95 The most recent one is entitled
123.237 "Good Anxiety: Harnessing the Power
125.217 "of the Most Misunderstood
Emotion," and a previous book
128.57 entitled "Healthy Brain, Happy Life:
130.257 "A Personal Program to Activate your Brain
132.257 "and Do Everything Better."
134.16 And while that is admittedly
a very pop science-type title,
138.6 I will remind you that she is one
140.53 of the preeminent memory
researchers in the world
143.58 and has been for quite a while,
146.02 so the information that
you'll glean from those books
148.57 is both rich in depth and
breadth and is highly applicable.
152.15 By the end of today's discussion,
153.8 you will have learned from
Dr. Suzuki a large amount
156.72 of knowledge about how
memories are formed,
159.0 how they are lost, and you
will have a much larger kit
162.38 of tools to apply for your
efforts to learn better,
166.21 to remember better, and
to apply that information
168.63 in the ways that best serve you.
170.44 Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast
172.97 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
175.89 It is, however, part of my
desire and effort to bring
178.38 zero-cost-to-consumer
information about science
180.55 and science-related tools
to the general public.
183.38 In keeping with that theme,
I'd like to thank the sponsors
185.71 of today's podcast.
187.2 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
189.42 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
190.99 vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink.
193.46 I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,
196.18 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
198.63 The reason I started taking
Athletic Greens, and the reason
200.91 I still take Athletic
Greens once or twice a day,
203.47 is that it meets all my
foundational vitamin, mineral,
206.19 and probiotic needs.
207.71 In fact, whenever people ask
me if I were to only take
210.69 one supplement, which
supplement should I take?
212.85 I tell them Athletic Greens
for the simple reason that
215.64 it covers your base of vitamins,
minerals, and probiotics,
218.68 it also has important adaptogens,
220.54 digestive enzymes for gut health.
222.8 All of this is very
important because we now know
225.33 that gut health and the
so-called gut-brain axis
228.9 is very important for things
like mood and brain function,
231.99 and also contributes to
immune system function.
234.97 With Athletic Greens, you're
covering all those bases.
237.92 And of course you need
to eat the nutrition
240.11 and healthy diet that's right for you,
241.98 but by taking Athletic
Greens once or twice a day,
244.521 you can be sure that there
are going to be no gaps
245.8 or deficiencies in your vitamin,
247.46 mineral, or probiotic needs.
249.95 I mix mine with water and
a little bit of lemon juice
251.99 or lime juice, I personally
find it delicious.
254.85 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
256.13 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
259.09 to claim a special offer.
260.24 They'll give you five free travel packs
262.01 plus a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2,
265.02 both of which are also vital
266.41 for immediate and long-term health.
268.34 So once again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
271.53 you can get a special offer
of five free travel packs
274.47 to make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens
276.37 while you're in the car
or otherwise traveling.
278.8 Plus, they'll give you the
year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.
282.21 Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
285.04 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
287.59 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
290.15 to help you better understand your body
291.73 and help you reach your health goals.
293.92 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
296.87 for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact
299.65 your immediate and long-term
health can only be analyzed
302.57 from a quality blood test.
304.0 And nowadays with the
advent of modern DNA tests,
306.8 you can also get insight
into, for instance,
308.85 what your biological
age is and compare that
310.94 to your chronological age.
312.0 And of course your
biological age is the number
314.64 that really matters.
316.29 With InsideTracker, there's
a distinct advantage
318.75 and the advantage is that while
there are many blood tests
321.19 and DNA tests out there,
InsideTracker's blood
323.3 and DNA tests come also with a platform,
326.7 meaning a website platform
that allows you to see
330.18 exactly what you could
or should do in order
332.76 to adjust the numbers on
things like hormone levels,
335.75 metabolic factors, and lipids, and so on.
338.22 It's a little popup window,
339.39 it points to nutritional, supplementation,
341.85 and behavioral regimens
that you can take in order
344.01 to put those numbers in the
ranges that are optimal for you.
347.0 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
348.45 you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
to get 20% off
352.4 any of InsideTracker's plans.
354.1 That's insidetracker.com/huberman

357.94 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Blinkist.
360.31 Blinkist is an app that has
thousands of non-fiction books,
363.69 each condensed down to just 15 minutes
365.61 of key takeaways for those books.
367.83 I love reading books from front to back.
370.19 I like the actual physical book.
371.68 I'm sort of old-fashioned in that way.
372.97 And I do also listen to audiobooks.
375.13 It's very rare that I don't
finish a book that I've started.
378.52 Nonetheless, I like to revisit
some of my favorite books,
381.07 I also like to write down key
takeaways from those books.
383.31 sometimes even before I listen
to the full-length book.
386.66 So I don't mind spoiling the
takeaways because when I read
389.65 non-fiction, generally
I'm trying to extract
391.42 the most valuable knowledge from them.
393.31 So I'll often listen to a
Blinkist 15-minute version,
396.23 then the full-length book,
397.76 or sometimes the full-length book,
399.51 and then the Blinkist 15-minute version.
401.54 Either way, Blinkist is a great
way to get through any book
404.5 and to extract the best from those books.
406.95 I've used it for, for instance,
408.36 Matt Walker's "Why We
Sleep," an excellent book
410.59 on why we sleep as well as Tim
Ferriss's "The 4-Hour Body,"
415.05 Nassim Taleb's "The Black
Swan," and so on, and so on.
419.15 With Blinkist, you get
unlimited access to read
421.3 or listen to a massive
library of non-fiction books.
424.23 It really is a treasure
trove of information.
426.57 Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
428.17 just for Huberman Lab Podcast listeners.
430.07 If you go to blinkist.com/huberman,
432.57 you can get a free seven-day trial
434.7 and 25% off a Blinkist premium membership.
438.16 Once again, go to
blinkist.com/huberman to get
441.36 a seven-day free trial and 25% off.
444.29 And now for my discussion
with Dr. Wendy Suzuki.
448.0 Wendy, great to see you
again and to have you here,
450.44 it's been a little while.
451.6 - It's been a while, so
great to be here, Andrew.
453.98 thank you so much for having me.
455.31 - Yeah, delighted.
457.26 I'd like to start off by
talking about memory generally,
460.86 and then I'd love to chat
about your incredible work,
464.82 discovering how exercise
and memory interface
468.05 and what people can do
to improve their memory
470.01 and brain function generally.
471.28 - Yes.
- But for those
473.08 that are not familiar, maybe
you could just step us through
476.51 the basic elements of memory,
478.92 a few brain structures, perhaps.
480.597 - Sure.
- You know, what happens
481.9 when I, for instance, this mug of tea
485.53 is pretty unremarkable.
487.26 But the fact that now
I've talked about it,
489.74 I don't know that I'll
ever forget about it.
491.76 Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
493.0 So what happens when I
look at this mug and decide
496.66 that it's something special
for whatever reason?
499.99 - Yeah, well, I like to
say there are four things
502.99 that make things memorable.
505.1 Number one is novelty.
508.08 If it's something new,
the very first thing,
510.637 the very first time we've seen something
512.74 or experienced something,
our brains are drawn to that,
515.66 our attentional systems draw us to that.
517.91 And when you are paying
attention to something,
520.34 that's part of what
makes things memorable.
523.47 Second is repetition.
525.22 If you see that cup of
tea every single day,
528.44 and every single time you do an interview
530.32 you talk about your cup of tea,
you're going to remember it.
532.47 That's just how our brains
work, repetition works.
537.15 Third is association.
539.8 So if you meet somebody new
544.19 that knows lots of people that you know,
547.05 so you and I share many, many, many,
549.13 many people that we both know.
551.51 It's easy to remember, it's
easier to remember you,
554.43 especially if you were
somebody new that I hadn't
556.85 met before, we have met
before, so association.
561.15 And then the fourth one
is emotional resonance.
564.72 So we remember the happiest
566.92 and the saddest moments of our lives,
569.35 and that also includes
funny, surprising things.
573.74 That is the interaction between
two key brain structures,
578.782 the amygdala, which is
important for processing
583.07 lots of emotional,
particularly threatening kinds
585.17 of situations, but those threatening,
588.27 surprising kinds of
situations, the amygdala takes
591.13 that information and makes
another key structure
594.71 called the hippocampus work better
598.02 to put new long-term
memories in your brain.
602.67 So that, in fact, is the key
structure for long-term memory,
606.64 this structure called the hippocampus.
608.98 - Fantastic, so novelty,
repetition, association,
611.77 and emotional resonance.
- Yes.
614.607 - Could you tell us a bit
more about the hippocampus?
616.14 I think, at least for my generation, well,
619.37 I'm a neuroscientist, but for
most people of my generation,
621.73 I think they first heard
about the hippocampus
623.65 from the movie "Memento."
625.19 - Oh yeah, yeah.
- Where the guy
626.023 says hippocampus, and for those of you
628.703 that haven't seen that movie,
629.81 it's a bizarrely constructed movie,
632.16 but an interesting one,
nonetheless, about memory.
636.2 But even as a neuroscientist,
638.33 sometimes I'm perplexed at
how the hippocampus works.
643.57 Maybe you could, if you would,
646.64 step us through kind of
what this structure is,
648.41 what it looks like, maybe
a few of its subregions,
651.33 because unlike vision,
the topic that I've worked
655.81 most of my career on, where we know, okay,
658.4 the eye does this part, and
the thalamus does this part,
660.61 and the cortex does that
part, I've always been
662.34 a little perplexed about
the hippocampus, frankly.
665.55 And I've read the textbooks
and I've heard the lectures,
667.42 but I'd love to get the update.
669.21 What are the general
themes of the hippocampus
671.23 as a structure and its function?
673.9 What do you think everyone,
including neuroscientists,
676.63 should know about the hippocampus?
678.06 - Absolutely, so let's
start with the basics.
681.26 The word hippocampus means seahorse.
684.23 It is shaped, the structure is shaped,
686.27 like a kind of curlicue
seahorse, that is accurate.
691.89 Everybody, including
neuroscientists, should know
694.08 it's a beautiful structure.
695.19 It is visually, anatomically beautiful
698.94 with these kind of intertwining
twirly subregions within it.
705.61 And I think that's one of the
reasons why early anatomists,
709.14 who were the very first
neuroscientists, got attracted to it
711.99 because it's this interesting
kind of twirly structure
714.97 deep in the heart of the brain.
717.01 So that's anatomically.
718.85 Functionally, what does it do?
721.65 Well, it's easiest to
understand what it does
725.89 when you look at what happens
728.72 when you don't have a hippocampus anymore.
730.6 What if you, by some disease,
734.57 or you have your hippocampus
removed by accident,
738.35 what happens?
739.3 Well, we know this from the most famous
743.04 neurological patient of all
time, his initials were HM,
748.05 so all psychology and
neuroscience students know him.
752.69 He was operated in 1954 and the
paper was published in 1957.
760.6 They removed both his
hippocampi because he had
764.1 very terrible epilepsy and
they knew that the hippocampus
768.05 was the genesis of epilepsy.
770.31 And this was experimental,
his epilepsy was so bad
774.04 that they decided not just to remove
775.75 one hippocampus, but both.
777.88 And what happened was
immediate loss of all ability
784.38 to form new memories for facts and events.
787.88 Think about that for a
second, all facts or events
792.06 you're not able to remember.
793.53 I can't remember this
interaction between us.
796.67 I can't remember any of
the facts that we were
798.78 just chatting about in
our neuroscience lives.
802.46 None of that can move
into our long-term memory.
807.51 So this hippocampus does something
809.94 with all of these perceptions
that are coming at us
812.95 every single day, every minute of the day,
815.42 and not for all of them,
but for some of them
818.83 that have these features
that we just talked about,
820.93 maybe they're novel, maybe
they have associations,
822.91 maybe they're emotionally relevant,
824.929 maybe they've been repeated,
828.19 some of those things in the realm of facts
830.86 or events get encoded
in our long-term memory.
835.81 And that's the textbook of why
839.39 the hippocampus is so important.
841.36 I like to always add, and I mean,
843.43 this is why I studied
it for so many years,
846.43 the hippocampus and what it does
847.89 really defines our own personal histories.
851.41 It means it defines who we are,
853.69 because if we can't
remember what we've done,
856.95 the information we've learned,
859.14 and the events of our lives,
861.34 it changes us, that's
what really defines us.
864.68 That's why I wanted to
study the hippocampus.
867.61 And I think the exciting, new
ideas about the hippocampus
873.82 is that it's, you know, hippocampus
876.68 is important for memory,
so if you say that,
878.79 you'll impress all your
people at your cocktail party,
882.81 but what people have started
to realize that it's not
887.3 just memory, it's not just
putting together associations
891.99 for what, where, and when
of events that happened
895.41 in our past, but it's
putting together information
898.7 that is in our long-term memory banks
901.54 in interesting new ways.
904.26 I'm talking about imagination.
906.21 So without the hippocampus,
yes, you can't remember things,
909.65 but actually you're not able
to imagine events or situations
915.11 that you've never experienced before.
917.67 So what that says is the
hippocampus is important for memory
921.72 is too simple a way to think about it.
924.1 What the hippocampus is
important for is what we've
926.94 already talked about, associating things
929.3 together writ large.
930.81 Anytime you need to
associate something together,
933.58 either for your past, your
present, or your future,
937.41 you are using your hippocampus.
938.79 And it takes on this
much more important role
943.08 in our cognitive lives when
we think about it like that.
945.96 That is kind of the new hippocampus
949.93 that neuroscientists
are studying these days.
952.46 - That's fantastic, so
it sounds like it really
954.13 sets context, but it can do that
956.62 with elements from the past,
the present, or the future.
959.87 - Yes.
- And for neuroscientists
963.13 the phrase is domain,
we say the time domain
965.99 meaning as opposed to just
evaluating things in space,
968.4 it sounds like the time domain
of hippocampal functioning
971.76 is incredibly interesting.
- It is.
974.16 - And even the fact that
we can have short-term,
975.97 medium-term, and long-term memories,
977.17 and we could go down any
of these rabbit holes.
979.85 I'll ask you a true or
false, mostly because
981.81 I just really want to know the answer.
984.03 A few years ago, the theme in
various high-profile reviews
987.46 seemed to be that the
hippocampus was involved
989.92 in encoding, in creating memories,
992.27 but not in storing memories
993.79 and that the memory storage
was in the neocortex
996.45 or the other overlying areas of the brain.
998.65 Is that too general a statement?
1004.289 - That's a tricky statement
because I think that ultimately,
1008.81 yes, that long-term memories
are stored in the cortex,
1013.38 but those memories are
stored in the hippocampus
1015.67 sometimes for a very, very long time.
1018.57 So how long is too long where you say, oh,
1022.39 it's not the hippocampus anymore?
1023.77 If it's four years, does that mean that
1027.99 it's not stored in the hippocampus?
1029.97 I think that's a tricky question.
1032.24 And yes, it was coming
up a lot because people
1034.79 were debating it and some people did think
1037.5 that you shouldn't think
about the hippocampus
1039.09 as a storage area, but I think it's
1041.44 a long, long, long-term kind
of intermediate storage area,
1046.4 maybe not the long-term storage area.
1048.7 That's why it's hard to
answer that question.
1050.49 - Great, as I recall,
HM could remember facts
1055.47 from before his surgery.
- Yes.
1057.33 - He couldn't form
1058.163 new memories.
- Correct.
1059.32 - And given that he had no hippocampus,
1061.0 it would at least
partially support the idea
1063.42 that some memories are retained
outside the hippocampus.
1067.15 - However, he did have part
1069.98 of his posterior hippocampus intact.
1072.89 So that's the tricky thing.
1074.84 I think initially, in fact, Scoville,
1077.81 the neurosurgeon overestimated
the number of millimeters
1084.87 he intended to remove of the hippocampus.
1087.38 And then when they did this,
the very historic MRI of HM
1093.32 later in his life, they
showed that, in fact,
1095.96 he did have that part of the
posterior hippocampus intact.
1100.02 So now it makes it a
little bit more complicated
1104.16 to interpret what's going on.
1105.64 Not that it was never
uncomplicated, any interpretation
1109.49 of a lesion in a patient,
as you know, is complicated,
1113.35 but HM had this mythical role
in neuroscience and neurology
1119.61 and now it was complicated
because he does have
1123.71 more of the hippocampus intact.
1125.57 - Got it, I did not know that.
1128.44 There are some memories that
can be formed very quickly,
1132.9 so called one-trial learning,
1134.64 and I'm just looking at
this list again, novelty,
1136.85 repetition, association,
and emotional resonance.
1140.26 It seems like some experiences
can bypass the need
1144.88 for multiple repetitions.
- Yeah, absolutely.
1148.79 - And unfortunately it seems
that our nervous system
1151.76 is skewed toward creating
one-trial memories
1155.19 for negative events.
- Right.
1156.76 - Which has a survival adaptive mechanism.
1159.83 What is the neural connection
that allows that to happen?
1163.24 Is it the amygdala to
hippocampus connection?
1165.78 I mean, as you and I know, it
seems like every brain area
1168.18 ultimately is connected
to everything else.
1169.83 It's just a question of
through how many nodes,
1171.91 just like every city is
connected to another city,
1173.583 it's just a question of
how many flights and roads
1175.87 do you have to traverse
before you get there.
1180.84 What is it about one-trial learning?
1182.86 I mean, at a kind of top contour level,
1186.42 how can we learn certain things so fast
1189.8 and other things are tricky?
1191.41 And now every time I
look at this white mug,
1192.98 it's queuing up something special
1194.7 simply by virtue of saying it.
1196.49 So is that one-trial memory?
1200.51 What is it about very
emotionally salient events
1203.69 that allow memories to get stamped in?
1206.32 - Yeah, I mean, I think
you've already alluded to it.
1210.26 That is there is this protective
function of our brains
1215.05 that has evolved over the
last 2.5 million years
1218.29 that you need to pay attention
1220.41 and remember certain
things for your survival.
1224.03 So some things that get
stamped in, they're memories,
1228.63 but they're fear memories.
1230.86 If I get mugged on the
subway or, you know,
1234.89 there are terrible things that
could happen on the subway
1237.14 as we just learned.
1238.91 But if something terrible happens,
1240.16 if something very scary
happens, you remember that,
1243.91 and that fear and that
memory of all those things,
1248.42 I mean, I have one when I
lived in Washington, DC,
1252.25 I went to work at NIH on a
Sunday afternoon and I came back
1255.53 and when I rounded the corner
to my door of my apartment,
1259.84 it was crowbarred in.
1261.64 Somebody had taken a crowbar,
1263.63 opened up my door, and stole
all of the nicest things
1269.19 in my apartment, which wasn't that nice,
1270.83 'cause I wasn't making that much money.
1273.33 But ever since then, whenever
I rounded that corner,
1278.59 I still had that memory.
1279.49 It was terrible because it
put me in a terrible state
1282.53 when I was just coming home
1284.47 and that's a survival mechanism.
1286.82 Do you want to be alert
to possible danger?
1290.46 Absolutely yes.
1291.77 So part of those one-trial
memories, I think,
1295.88 is often taking advantage of this
1298.45 evolutionarily developed
system to tamp in things
1303.1 that could be potentially
dangerous to you into your memory.
1306.53 So you forever will remember
this particular corner
1311.23 or this hallway because
that is where something
1314.53 really bad happened to you.
1316.64 - It seems like a location.
1318.36 We talk about conditioned place aversion,
1320.67 which is just a geek speak
for wanting to avoid the place
1323.62 where something bad happened,
1324.69 or conditioned place
preference, wanting to go back
1327.02 to a place where something
positive happened.
1328.87 Or even looking at a
photograph of where you had
1331.08 a wonderful time with
somebody and that can evoke
1333.33 all sorts of positive sensations.
1336.03 It seems like at some level,
as complex as the brain is,
1340.63 the basic elements of
feeling good or feeling lousy
1344.23 are states within the brain
and body and linking those
1347.15 to places seems like it's a
pretty straightforward formula,
1350.55 you know, link place to state,
link state to place, etc.,
1354.25 as your description just provided.
1356.98 When we learn more complex information,
1360.61 a poem, a concept, or we
have to ratchet through
1365.86 a set of ideas, that also involves memory.
1371.23 I'm sure that we'll talk more about this,
1373.54 but is there any way that
you are aware of that state,
1379.02 bodily state can be leveraged
to enhance the speed
1384.5 or the quality of memories
and memory formation?
1390.48 So to be clear about it,
1392.76 it seems there's something very
important about this fourth,
1396.19 this emotional resonance component.
1399.43 Novelty, the crowbar into the doors,
1402.12 thank goodness sounds like it was novel,
1404.11 it wasn't repeated thing, thank goodness.
1406.26 So repetition is out and the association
1408.07 is very, very strong.
1410.09 But for people trying to learn
information that they're not
1413.56 that excited about, or
that repetition is hard,
1418.25 or the novelty is simply
that it's painful.
1423.15 - Yes, I've been there, absolutely.
1425.43 - Yeah, as have I.
1427.73 Is there something that
we can do to leverage
1431.09 knowledge of how the memory
system works naturally
1433.56 to make that a more
straightforward process?
1437.78 - So, I immediately turn to
the things that I've studied
1444.04 that you talk about so
beautifully on your podcast,
1447.26 which are strategies generally to make
1452.81 your brain work better.
1454.41 I was just reminding myself
of your podcast about cold
1460.51 because I use that every morning.
1462.01 - Oh, you do cold?
- I do, I do.
1463.03 - Just take a moment
and, and just tell us,
1464.94 what is your cold exposure protocol,
1466.42 then I'll take you back
to what you're saying.
1467.64 - So my cold exposure
protocol is at the end
1471.46 of every morning shower that I take,
1476.23 the shower is warm, but I give
myself a big blast of cold
1481.32 at the end of that and
it makes me feel so good.
1485.75 And because I've been
doing it for several years,
1488.15 it's so much less painful.
1489.63 Okay, I admit, it was really
painful at the beginning,
1493.59 but it's much less painful.
1496.33 I could handle the cold water and my pipes
1499.34 give nice, really cold water.
1502.23 And it just, I could feel
the awakedness kind of
1507.62 come up in me after that.
1510.63 And I miss it, if I forget to do it,
1512.15 sometimes I run back in and
give myself that cold blast
1516.16 because it is upping,
1520.25 I think you talked about
this on your podcast,
1521.97 what's happening in the brain?
1523.7 - Basically the cold stimulus, that shock,
1527.241 that catching your breath, etc.,
1529.01 is adrenaline from the adrenals.
1531.52 But also from what we understand now,
1533.59 some new neuroimaging, there's epinephrine
1536.4 and norepinephrine released
from locus ceruleus,
1538.802 which again is a brain structure
in the back of the brain,
1540.76 kind of sprinklers the rest of the brain
1543.07 with a kind of a wake-up chemical.
1544.82 And there's a long arc
on dopamine release.
1547.58 This paper back in 2000 showed
that it's a steady increase
1551.49 up to about 2.5x of circulating dopamine.
1554.1 So they weren't looking directly
in the brain admittedly,
1556.51 but it goes on for four or five hours.
1558.58 - Wow, yeah.
- So the improved mood
1560.67 and the feeling of
alertness is a real thing.
1562.95 - Yeah, yeah, so I use that.
1565.8 I mean, so basically I
use my morning routine.
1569.16 What is my morning routine?
1570.22 I get up, I do a 45-minute tea meditation.
1575.3 So meditating over the
brewing and drinking of tea
1578.68 that I learned from a monk
who has an institute in Taiwan
1583.3 where he teaches tea meditation, love it.
1585.67 I've learned all about tea,
different kinds of tea.
1589.67 And then I do a 30-minute
cardio weights workout.
1596.59 Then I take my shower with
the hot-cold contrast.
1600.66 And, oh, and before that, key thing,
1604.38 if I want to learn something
and I want to be able
1607.0 to get over the difficulty
of repeating things,
1613.3 or just push myself to do stuff, sleep,
1616.61 so good, good sleep.
1618.73 I've learned that over the pandemic,
1621.24 I did sleep experiments on
myself and I learned that I was
1624.73 sleeping an hour less
than I really needed.
1627.03 So I really need seven-and-a-half
to eight hours of sleep.
1629.57 And I was getting six and a half.
1631.23 And so now, I get that
seven-and-a-half to eight hours
1636.72 every single night, and guess what?
1638.93 I come to different difficult
tasks and I am more willing
1643.14 to give it a try, to try longer,
1645.33 to try harder, and my brain works better.
1648.2 And so I think probably if you go back
1650.27 to all of your podcasts,
you'll learn exactly why
1652.9 each one of those things that I do,
1654.93 which I would bet that
you probably do, too,
1657.74 is helping my brain.
1659.68 - I guarantee they are.
1661.82 And I'm impressed that
you do all these things,
1663.45 although not surprised.
1664.7 And I should say that
the extra hour of sleep
1667.08 is really impressive and
extremely beneficial.
1670.39 I'm curious, do you get that
in the early part of the night
1673.31 by going to bed earlier?
- Yeah.
1675.38 - Terrific, and I should just mention,
1678.13 'cause you're too humble to
do it, but I'll say it again
1680.65 that not only are you a full professor,
1684.59 tenured full professor
and running a laboratory,
1686.37 you teach undergraduates,
1687.4 you have an important
role in public education,
1690.45 multiple books, and you're now
1691.53 dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences at NYU.
1694.81 So the extra hour of
sleep is benefiting you
1698.01 and as a consequence benefiting
everybody else as well.
1701.98 Thanks for sharing with us your protocol.
1703.68 I took you off the trajectory
of what one can do,
1706.55 but I think that people
and I appreciate knowing
1711.15 kind of what the practical steps are.
1713.11 Because knowing the science is important,
1714.69 mechanism I do believe is
important for embedding protocols
1718.15 in people's minds and why
they might want to do them,
1719.94 but really hearing the
mechanics of it is useful.
1723.74 It sounds like everything
together takes about an hour,
1725.74 it's not an excessive amount of time,
1727.59 but it probably gives you an outsized
1729.89 positive effect on your day.
1731.48 - Absolutely, I definitely notice it
1734.7 if I'm not able to do it.
1737.33 And when I don't, so I do
this seven days a week,
1740.48 it's also not just five
days, seven days a week.
1744.32 And when I can't do it,
1746.12 it's usually early-morning
flights or things like that.
1750.953 And I get over it, but it's
1753.727 critical for the working of my brain.
1756.14 - I love it and I'll just
highlight one thing that you said
1758.71 before we move on, which is
that you said when sometimes
1760.88 if you get out of the
shower before the cold,
1762.79 you'll get back in.
1764.09 That's, to me, a really beautiful example
1766.66 of conditioned place preference.
1768.85 Now the cold shower has
become something that
1770.737 you sort of look forward to.
1772.21 I should say that nobody is
immune from the adrenaline
1776.09 increase of cold, no matter how cold,
1777.96 this is what's interesting about cold.
1779.32 It's one of the reasons why
it's such an important part
1781.82 of the screening for special operations,
1783.65 so our SEAL teams, but other
branches in military too,
1787.39 which is that there are very
few stimuli that you can give
1791.54 anyone and consistently get an adrenaline
1796.145 - Oh, interesting.
- Release from that
1797.68 without harming them.
1798.9 With heat, eventually you
need to use so much heat
1800.693 that you damage tissue.
1802.21 Or with exercise, you have
to use so much exercise
1803.903 that you can damage joints.
1806.07 And it's this very kind of brilliant,
1811.11 I don't know if it was intentional or not,
1813.08 it's sort of unintentional
genius that special operations
1816.14 has figured out that by sending
people back into the cold
1818.78 over and over, it never
really gets easier,
1821.11 but over time people
actually start to crave it
1823.71 and it provides this reduction
in inflammation, etc.
1826.38 So anyway, beautiful practice, thank you.
1828.77 I want to learn more
about your tea meditation
1830.53 later in the episode.
1831.53 But in any event returning to ways that
1836.41 we can improve memory formation.
1840.09 Maybe if you would tell
us your story around this.
1843.47 I know you've told it before,
1844.9 but I think a lot of members
of the audience and I
1848.325 would love to hear how you came to this.
1849.393 Because growing up in
neuroscience, I knew you
1851.98 as one of the, I would say
one of the three or four,
1855.38 and they're all alongside one another,
1858.46 this isn't a hierarchical statement,
1860.1 three or four top memory
researchers in the world.
1863.09 Textbook material is Suzuki.
1866.75 My textbooks are filled
with the word Suzuki,
1868.63 your last name,
1870.07 according to the information
on memory and memory formation.
1875.25 So you were doing that
and doing the things
1878.41 that academics do, and then
you're still doing that,
1883.354 and still at a very high level,
1884.5 but then things took
a different direction.
1886.15 And maybe we could talk about
your story and how you came
1890.13 to the place you are at now
1892.8 because I think it
provides a number of tools
1894.42 that people could implement themselves.
1896.85 - Yeah, so this story
happened as I was working
1902.74 to get tenure at NYU.
1904.92 And, as you know, it's
a stress-filled process.
1908.47 They give you six years to show your stuff
1911.64 and you are judged in front
of all your colleagues.
1913.89 And either they say, okay,
you can join the club
1916.49 or they say, sorry, you are humiliated
1919.65 in front of everybody.
1920.67 This was what was going on in my life.
1922.02 - They actually tell people to leave.
1923.621 If you don't get tenure, you're gone.
1924.454 - You have to leave your institution.
1926.38 And so, you work really, really hard.
1929.89 And so my strategy was,
1932.72 I'm just going to not do anything but work
1934.5 and I'm just going to work.
1935.7 And I'm going to just work as hard
1938.92 as I can for the six years.
1940.54 And what happens when you
work and you don't have
1944.07 any sort of life outside of work
1946.29 and you live in New York
where there's all sorts
1948.78 of really good takeout,
you gain 25 pounds,
1951.45 which is exactly what I did.
1952.61 And you get really, really stressed.
1954.13 And you start to ask
yourself how come I'm living
1956.26 in New York City, and I love Broadway,
1958.27 and I haven't gone to a
Broadway show in two years?
1963.0 And so I, 25 pounds overweight,
1969.77 I decided to go on vacation.
1972.1 And I went by myself
'cause I had no friends.
1974.77 And I went to, I did
1977.2 an adventure river rafting trip in Peru.
1982.88 And so I go by myself and
meet other interesting people
1986.93 and I was the weakest
person on this whole trip.
1990.72 Like they were so much in better
shape, it was embarrassing
1997.13 and they won't say this,
they won't admit this
1999.08 to me, but it was true.
2000.49 And I kind of came back and I said, okay,
2002.62 I cannot be the weakest person.
2005.02 I'm in my late 30s, I
have to do something.
2007.56 So I went to the gym
and I said, oh my God,
2010.58 I'm 25 pounds overweight,
2012.19 let's try at least to lose this weight.
2015.04 And so I go to the gym, I
notice how much better I feel
2019.12 when I go to just a single class.
2020.74 I remember the very first class I went to
2022.2 was a hip hop dance class.
2023.51 I'm a terrible hip hop dancer,
2025.28 but I still felt good after that class.
2028.76 And then fast forward a year and a half,
2032.28 I've lost the 25 pounds,
so proud of myself,
2035.68 so much happier.
2037.17 And I'm sitting in my office
doing what you and I do a lot,
2040.44 which is writing an NIH
grant, which is our lifeblood.
2044.53 And writing, writing, writing,
2046.44 and this thought goes
through my mind that had
2048.67 never gone through my mind before
2051.08 during this six years
of frantic grant writing
2055.08 when I was trying to get tenure,
2056.53 and that thought was grant
writing went well today.
2060.55 You know, that felt good.
2062.75 I was like, I've never
had that thought before,
2065.5 what's going on here,
this is really weird?
2067.72 - I don't know that anyone
has had that thought before.
2070.403 - No, I'm sure people
have had that thought.
2072.07 But I thought maybe I'm
just having a good day.
2076.6 But when I thought about it,
2078.21 I thought it's not just today.
2080.68 My grant writing seems to
have been getting smoother,
2084.87 like I'm able to focus longer,
2087.25 the sessions feel better to me.
2090.903 And at that point, the only
thing that I changed in my life,
2093.9 it was a huge thing, but I had become
2095.56 a gym rat rather than a workaholic.
2099.11 And that's when my spidey
sense for neuroscientists
2104.13 popped up and I said, what
do we know about the effects
2106.8 of exercise on your brain?
2108.9 Because if I think about it,
2110.88 what was better about my
writing is I could focus longer
2114.16 and deeper, very important,
2116.17 and I could remember those
little details that you try
2119.56 and pull together for your
million dollar NIH grant
2122.69 from 30 different articles
that you have open
2125.41 on your screen all at the same time,
2127.26 that's the hippocampal memory.
2129.07 I was studying that, I
was writing the grant
2131.03 on hippocampal memory.
2132.88 And so that's when I got really
interested in the effects
2138.21 of exercise on both prefrontal
focus and attention function
2142.96 and hippocampal function
because of my own observation.
2146.98 I still remember where I was sitting,
2148.9 which office I was in,
when I had this revelation.
2152.12 But the thing that
really sealed it for me,
2153.96 that made me think not just,
oh, this is interesting,
2157.6 but I want to study this,
is right around that time
2162.98 I got a phone call from my
mom who said that my dad
2167.65 wasn't feeling well and
that he had told her
2172.1 that he got lost driving
back from the 7-11,
2174.98 which was literally seven
blocks from our house
2177.96 that I grew up in.
2179.56 And I knew that was hippocampal function.
2183.22 I suspected dementia. I suspected, oh,
2186.02 didn't want to admit Alzheimer's dementia,
2188.14 which he had.
2189.81 And it was funny because,
I mean it wasn't funny,
2193.13 but my mom and dad are two
sides of a very different coin.
2199.54 My dad is the engineer,
not so active all his life,
2205.51 but would loved and sit
and read books all day.
2208.94 My mom was the athlete.
2210.65 She played team tennis into her 80s.
2214.65 And it started to show at that point.
2219.1 And so then I had even
a more pressing reason
2225.88 to think about what the
effects of exercise were
2228.17 because I noticed that all
the things that were improving
2231.22 in my brain suddenly went
away in my dad's brain.
2234.73 Really, really smart guy,
engineer in Silicon Valley,
2238.21 helped that push in Silicon
Valley in the '70s happen,
2243.8 he had no more memory.
2244.93 He couldn't focus his attention.
2246.63 His mood was rock bottom,
he's a very happy guy.
2251.16 And everything was the opposite in me.
2253.1 And I started thinking this
isn't just something to help
2256.67 somebody who wants to get
tenure, this is something
2260.21 that could help millions
and millions of people,
2263.64 most importantly, our aging population.
2266.93 What if, you know, what's happening?
2269.35 And so the thing that makes
me wake up in the morning is
2273.28 when I realized that every
single time you move your body,
2278.56 you are releasing a whole
bunch of neurochemicals.
2282.34 And some of them we've talked about,
2284.33 the good mood comes from
dopamine, and serotonin,
2286.657 and noradrenaline, but the
thing that gets released also,
2290.13 particularly with aerobic
exercise, is a growth factor
2293.54 called brain derived
neurotrophic factor, or BDNF.
2298.51 And that is so important
because what it does is it goes
2301.51 directly to your hippocampus
and it helps brand new
2305.07 brain cells grow in your hippocampus.
2307.4 We all have that.
2308.233 Even if you're a couch potato,
2309.22 you can get new brain cells
in your hippocampus to grow.
2311.72 But it's like giving
your hippocampus a boost
2315.65 with this regular BDNF,
if you are exercising.
2319.51 Which means that we all
have the capacity to grow
2323.2 a bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
2326.55 And so what I like to
give people is this image
2329.95 of every single time you move your body,
2331.75 it's like giving your brain
this wonderful bubble bath
2334.62 of neurochemicals, what's going on,
2336.67 I need my bubble bath of
noradrenaline, and dopamine,
2339.89 and serotonin, and growth factors.
2342.71 And with regular bubble
baths, what am I doing?
2345.94 I'm growing a big fat, fluffy hippocampus.
2349.18 And I'm not going to cure
my father's dementia,
2352.63 Alzheimer's dementia, but you know what?
2354.85 If I go into my 70s with a
big fat, fluffy hippocampus,
2359.1 even if I had that in my genes
and it starts to kick in,
2363.06 it's going to take longer for
that disease to start to affect
2366.43 my ability to form and
retain new long-term memories
2369.24 for facts and events, which is
my motivation for getting up
2372.57 and doing my 30 to 45 minutes
of aerobic exercise every day.
2376.16 - Fantastic.
2379.27 Quick question about your
protocol just because.
2382.26 And then we'll discuss a few
mechanistic things related
2385.68 to what signals the body
might be sending the brain
2389.12 and a little bit more detail
on BDNF and some circuitry.
2394.91 So 30 to 45 minutes of, it sounds like
2398.24 cardiovascular exercise might be special.
2401.91 But as I say that and I
think about the literature
2405.18 that I'm aware of in
mice and some in monkeys,
2408.19 and certainly in humans, looking
at the effects of exercise
2411.64 on brain function and
typically the outcome
2413.94 is improvement, almost always.
2415.39 I don't think I've ever
seen a paper showing
2416.97 that when animals or humans exercise more,
2419.92 that their brain gets worse.
2422.446 I just can't think of a single paper.
2424.06 It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
2425.34 I'm sure someone will put
one in the comment section.
2427.65 They'll find that one,
2428.64 and thank you for if you can find that,
2432.25 but it seems like it's always
cardiovascular exercise
2434.45 and experimentally in a lab
it's a lot easier to get a mouse
2436.82 to run on a treadmill than it is
2438.5 to get a mouse to lift weights.
2439.58 Although people have put
little ankle weights on mice
2441.68 and the ways of getting
mice to do resistance work
2444.84 is actually a little bit barbaric
2446.337 - Little stressful.
- 'Cause oftentimes
2448.189 they'll incapacitate a limb
to overload another limb,
2450.53 so it's an asymmetric thing.
2451.83 It's not the same as sending
them in to do squats,
2455.26 or deadlifts, or something.
2457.83 But cardiovascular
exercise might be special.
2460.87 And what are your thoughts on that?
2463.1 And please first, though,
tell us your routine.
2466.42 Your routine is 30 to 45 minutes of,
2468.94 are you a Peloton cycler?
2471.4 Does it matter?
2473.28 - I think that the data
suggests that as long
2476.47 as your heart rate is getting
up for these long-term effects
2479.69 on your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex,
2482.02 you also get better at
shifting and focusing
2486.18 your attention, for that
you need cardiovascular.
2490.04 And what I use is a video
workout that I started
2492.88 even before the pandemic,
it's called "Daily Burn,"
2495.12 and is just thousands
of different workouts.
2497.99 But I love they are 30 minutes
that I sometimes add on
2502.39 a 10 to 15 minute stretch at
the beginning or at the end.
2506.11 But I love the variety.
2507.9 Sometimes I do it with weight.
2509.11 Sometimes I do it without weights.
2511.43 I love kickboxing,
2512.38 so they have a lot of kickboxing in there.
2514.22 It just fits my routine,
and it's always there,
2519.57 and I don't have to get
all dressed up to go
2522.12 to the gym to work out.
2524.36 So that's what I do.
2525.56 - And that's a daily
thing, seven days a week?
2527.46 - Yeah, yeah.
- Seven days
2528.37 a week, fantastic.
2530.69 So in terms of he way
that some of these changes
2533.26 are being conveyed from
the body to the brain,
2536.57 that fascinates me.
2537.81 I mean, as you and I know, and I'm sort of
2539.92 a repeating record on the
podcast always saying,
2544.232 you got a brain but you
also have a spinal cord
2545.5 and then your nervous
system connects everything.
2547.16 Every organ in your body
is basically signaled to
2550.4 by the nervous system and
back to the nervous system,
2552.7 you're explaining everything.
2554.16 But so let's imagine your morning routine,
2557.35 you do your cardiovascular exercise,
2559.82 so you're pumping more blood,
2561.43 that's the definition
of a higher heart rate,
2563.27 stroke volume of the
heart goes up over time,
2566.31 you're getting fitter, so blood flow
2568.2 to the brain is increasing.
2569.63 Do we know how that gets
translated to a signal
2573.46 to release more BDNF?
2576.06 And then it raises this
other question, which is,
2578.32 does it matter where your
mind is when you exercise?
2581.34 Because ultimately the brain, of course,
2583.75 you can anchor your attention
to the exercise or you can be
2585.8 listening to a podcast or something else.
2587.75 I've always wondered about this.
2589.81 Can we enhance the effects
of exercise by combining
2592.4 the enhanced blood flow with
cognitive work during exercise?
2596.906 Or is it simply a matter of
just getting more blood flow
2598.61 up to the hippocampus?
2599.84 - Yeah, I wish I had the
answer to that question, too.
2603.08 My instinct is, yes, it matters partially
2607.12 because of the work of
your colleague, Alia Crum,
2609.82 on mindset and the power of that to change
2613.67 how physiologically
our body is responding.
2617.39 So how could it not
work in her experiments
2621.53 or work in her experiments and not work
2623.88 for my morning or our
morning exercise routine.
2628.61 But are there studies, point to a study,
2630.32 I don't know of one.
2631.22 So exercise neuroscientists out there,
2635.42 I'd love to see that study done.
2639.14 So yes, it works.
2641.07 Before I go into the aerobic thing,
2643.94 I always like to start with
the least amount of exercise
2647.61 to get something really useful,
2650.17 because I don't want people to say,
2652.1 oh God, I hate sweating,
2654.23 I don't want to listen anymore.
2656.59 So I always like to start
with studies have shown
2660.45 that just 10 minutes of walking
outside can shift your mood.
2664.77 That is part of that
neurochemical bubble bath
2667.01 that you're getting dopamine,
serotonin, noradrenaline
2671.283 and anybody can walk for 10 minutes.
2674.35 And so that is for all of
you thinking that out there,
2678.64 what is the minimum that I could get
2680.16 some of these brain effects?
2681.09 10 minutes of walking, anybody can do it.
2683.107 - Now is outside important?
2684.54 I'm a big believer in getting
photons into the eyes.
2689.0 - I think that that study was
done indoors on a treadmill.
2694.28 And the comparison wasn't
done, but moving your,
2697.62 which is great, in the
middle of the pandemic
2700.55 I walked around my apartment
for 30 minutes sometimes
2703.25 just for some variety,
2705.6 felt like a rat on a
running wheel, but yes.
2709.48 So that minimum amount
of movement in your body
2715.2 can get you those mood effects.
2718.03 But what about the big,
fat, fluffy hippocampus?
2721.67 What about the better
performing prefrontal cortex?
2724.1 That's where you start to
need the cardio workout.
2729.1 And from my reading of the literature,
2731.65 there haven't been enough studies
2734.93 directly comparing and contrasting
kickboxing with running,
2738.1 with whatever other cardio
that you need to do,
2742.1 but any cardio workout that is done
2744.86 has these positive effects.
2746.25 So I'm going to say my
interpretation of that is that
2748.84 whatever way you get your heart rate up,
2751.36 including a power walk,
a power walk can get
2754.29 your heart rate up, that is beneficial.
2757.3 And what is happening, there
are two pathways that have been
2760.43 studied about how you go from
moving your body to more BDNF,
2765.36 that neurotrophin that's
increasing the growth
2769.58 of new hippocampal brain cells.
2771.39 The two pathways are the following.
2772.84 One is a myokine, which is a protein
2776.11 released by the muscles.
2778.16 And not your heart, these are
striated muscles in your body.
2781.79 And so by running, these
were studies done in rats
2785.52 on running wheels, they
showed that the running rats
2789.06 had more of this myokine,
2791.9 released the myokine past
the blood-brain barrier.
2794.92 so got into the rarefied,
very protected bloodstream
2799.67 of inside the brain, and that
myokine stimulated the release
2804.65 of BDNF in the brain,
that's pathway number one.
2808.72 Pathway number two comes through the liver
2812.09 because exercise is a stress generally.
2816.44 How do we know that,
well, cortisol is released
2818.61 whenever we exercise.
2820.04 We need that sugar in our blood
2823.73 and so that's how the
physiological mechanisms work.
2827.82 And so there is a ketone,
beta-hydroxybutyrate,
2834.02 that we've known for a very
long time that gets released
2836.94 by the liver during exercise.
2839.3 And we also know that that
particular ketone passes
2843.13 that blood-brain barrier.
2844.27 And it's another stimulant for BDNF.
2846.19 So kind of the final
common pathway seems to be
2851.24 BDNF stimulation in the hippocampus.
2854.19 Is it the only one, probably not,
2856.65 but that's the one that has
been studied most clearly.
2859.42 So it comes from all of
our physiological systems,
2862.9 our muscles working, our
liver responding to the stress
2866.83 of exercise, and what is it doing,
2869.51 it is giving more BDNF
precursors to get into our brain,
2876.01 to cause the upspike
of BDNF, which is part
2879.62 of your bubble bath that you're
getting every time you move.
2882.2 - I love that description
of a factor from muscle
2885.21 and a factor from liver,
because anytime we're thinking
2888.85 about movement of the
body and translating that
2890.74 to the brain, as you
so clearly pointed out,
2894.56 that needs to traverse
the blood-brain barrier.
2898.73 Not everything that happens in the body
2900.23 is communicated to the brain
2902.722 and these seem like
really important signals.
2905.04 Beta-hydroxybutyrate, you
mentioned is a ketone,
2908.73 I just want to underscore
that doesn't mean, folks,
2911.39 that you need to be on a ketogenic diet.
2913.43 I think people hear ketone and they think,
2915.88 I know some people are, most
people are not, I imagine.
2920.07 There are ketones that
are released in your brain
2921.93 and body that can function,
2923.07 even if you're ingesting
carbohydrates and not ketogenic,
2926.81 just for a point of clarification.
2929.57 This issue of new neurons
is one that you hear a lot,
2933.64 you know, neurogenesis,
you're going to grow
2935.58 new neurons, new neurons.
2937.68 And my understanding is
that the rodent literature
2940.07 is very clear that animals
that run on wheels more often,
2944.22 it turns out rodents
love to run on wheels.
2945.84 Do you know these
studies by Hoppy Holster,
2947.58 which are pretty funny,
2948.9 they're very cool, by the way, Hoppy,
2950.88 Howard Hughes investigator,
I'm not making light of them.
2954.42 They put running wheels in
a field and wild rodents
2959.62 will run to the running wheel
and run on that running wheel.
2962.41 - Oh, that's great.
- They really enjoy it.
2964.11 Which I find amusing for
reasons that probably
2966.73 only a neuroscientist would find amusing.
2969.43 In any case, in rodents,
it seems that running more
2973.67 on a wheel can trigger neurogenesis,
2976.65 literally the birth of new
neurons and the addition
2979.75 of new neurons to the hippocampus.
2981.95 In monkeys, this has been controversial.
2984.74 It seems it does happen in the hippocampus
2986.237 and in the olfactory bulb,
2988.05 probably not in the neocortex.
2989.95 Thinking back to the
decades or more controversy
2992.84 between Liz Gould and Pasko Rakic.
2995.06 I hope they settled
their differences there.
2997.59 Neuroscientists love to argue.
3000.19 It's kind of what we do.
3002.75 And in humans, I think it's
been a bit controversial.
3005.98 Some people say absolutely, yes.
3007.93 Other people say absolutely no,
3009.31 there are new neurons
added to the adult brain.
3013.51 I haven't followed that
literature down to the detail.
3017.14 But I do remember one study
that I don't think is contested,
3021.23 which is the work of Rusty
Gage at the Salk Institute
3024.42 where they actually injected
a sort of due type marker
3028.83 into the brains of terminally ill humans
3031.78 who very graciously offered
to have their brains removed
3034.96 and dissected after death.
3036.92 And in some cases, these very
old terminally ill humans,
3042.13 they did see evidence for new neurons
3045.05 being born in the hippocampus.
3046.64 Can I trust that idea still?
3048.83 Is that generally accepted?
3050.52 - Well, so after that study,
which was quite a while ago,
3054.86 there are more recent
studies, still controversial,
3058.04 but showing and
demonstrating, using even new
3061.86 and better techniques than were used
3063.6 in that original Rusty Gage study,
3065.5 which was groundbreaking
at the time, that suggest,
3070.26 and I think show, that
there are new neurons born
3074.12 in adult human brains into
the ninth decade of life.
3079.54 So they not only did this, I think
3081.47 those patients were in their
60s, then they died of cancer.
3086.71 But these new studies
looking across the timeline,
3090.13 can we see, because the
other thing was, yeah,
3092.18 maybe you have some when you're 20,
3094.24 but by the time you're
older and you might need
3096.71 these new neurons, you
have no new neuron growth.
3099.89 And so these studies seem to
suggest that, yes, yes you do.
3105.55 And we all do even into old age.
3109.3 - Great, and I'll just
take a moment to say
3111.33 that I am personally
not aware of any studies
3113.98 looking at other forms of exercise
3117.06 besides cardiovascular exercise
for sake of brain health.
3120.3 And this, I think, is an
important gap in the literature
3123.09 that ought to be filled,
whether or not for instance,
3125.42 high intensity interval training,
3127.35 or whether or not weight training,
3130.5 which has other effects
on the musculature,
3132.69 so you can imagine perhaps
the myokine to BDNF pathway,
3135.5 the pathway one that you
mentioned, might be signaled,
3137.49 but maybe not the liver pathway, maybe.
3139.39 Yes, I'm speculating here.
3140.91 Those studies need to be done.
3142.13 To my knowledge, they just
haven't been done yet.
3145.14 But they should be done.
3147.35 If you would, could you tell us about
3148.7 some of the more specific
effects of exercise on memory?
3155.345 Memory is a broad category
of effects and phenomena.
3158.73 So things like what comes to mind is
3161.13 short-term, medium- and long-term memory,
3162.7 reaction time, learning
math, at least for me,
3167.11 is quite a bit different
than learning history,
3171.05 although there's certainly overlap
3172.54 in the neural underpinnings.
3174.79 What has been demonstrated
in the laboratory
3177.55 in animal models, but
especially in humans,
3180.28 and if you want to share
with us any results
3182.59 from your lab, published or unpublished,
3185.39 I'm sure that the audience
would be delighted
3186.81 to learn about them.
3187.69 - Absolutely, let me start with kind of
3190.17 the immediate effects, acute
effects as they're called,
3193.47 of exercise on the brain.
3195.04 So this is asking what does
a one-off exercise session
3199.15 do for your brain?
3200.92 And there, there are three major effects
3205.56 that have been reproduced.
3206.87 I've seen it in my lab, many
labs have reproduced this.
3210.06 So what do you get with the one-off?
3212.11 This is usually an
aerobic-type exercise session,
3215.69 30 to 45 minutes.
3217.54 What you get is that mood
boost, very, very consistent.
3221.635 You get improved prefrontal function,
3226.15 typically tested with a Stroop test,
3229.42 which is a test that asks
you to shift and focus
3232.28 your attention in specific ways.
3234.77 It's a challenging task
and clearly dependent
3237.15 on the prefrontal cortex largely.
3239.57 And significant improvements
in reaction time,
3243.08 so your speed at responding,
often a motor kind of,
3247.72 but cognitive motor response is improved.
3251.94 Over the pandemic, one of the
unpublished studies that I did
3255.17 looking at the effects of 30 minutes
3258.16 of age-appropriate workout in subjects
3262.63 ranging in age from their 20s
3265.0 all the way up to their 90s.
3267.12 So what are the things that
I saw more consistently?
3271.88 Irrespective of your age,
everybody got a decreased anxiety
3277.08 and depression and hostility
score, which is very important.
3282.131 So it's not just decreasing
your anxiety and depression
3284.72 but decreasing your hostility levels.
3287.439 - Making the world a better place.
3288.69 - Making the world a better place.
3291.43 Energy, the feeling of energy went up.
3294.48 And what we found is in
the older population,
3298.42 even more than in the younger population,
3300.87 we saw improved performance on both Stroop
3304.29 and Eriksen flanker task,
which is another task dependent
3308.71 on really focusing in on different letters
3312.54 and paying attention to
what letter is being shown.
3315.92 So these are consistent effects.
3319.01 How long do they last?
3320.13 One of the studies that I did
publish in my lab showed that
3322.67 the immediate effects of
exercise lasted up to two hours.
3327.52 Unfortunately, that was
the longest that we last,
3329.23 they were still there at two hours.
3332.167 So that's a pretty big bang for your buck.
3335.86 - That is.
- One 30 minute.
3337.47 - Sorry to interrupt, I just
want to make sure I understand.
3339.49 So when you say the effects
lasted up to two hours,
3342.4 does that mean up to two hours
after you finished exercise?
3345.86 Or up to two hours of
memory challenging work?
3353.85 Just to be clear.
3354.683 - Yeah, that's a great question.
3355.84 So my study looked at two hours
3361.59 after you finish your workout
3363.46 we gave you these cognitive tests.
3365.03 During that two-hour period,
you were free to do anything
3368.47 except exercise or eat.
3370.03 And so there was no extra load on people.
3374.54 But two hours later, you
did do significantly better
3377.67 on these focused attention
tasks compared to a group
3382.99 that watched videos for
the exercise period.
3386.57 This was an hour of cycling that they did.
3389.71 These were young subjects in their 20s.
3391.97 - Okay, so if I finish
my exercise at 9:00 AM,
3397.02 even if I start this cognitive
work, this mental work at 11,
3401.55 I'll still see benefits.
3402.73 - Yes, at least by 11,
3404.45 because I didn't go
farther than two hours.
3407.47 So it could last even longer than that,
3409.49 but I have evidence that
it lasts for two hours.
3411.99 - And perhaps if I had
started the cognitive work
3415.14 45 minutes after my exercise ended,
3417.42 it would also be helpful.
3418.87 - Yes.
- So there's no reason
3419.77 to think that there's a,
3421.215 that you have to wait before
starting cognitive work.
3422.048 - Yeah, no reason at all.
3423.66 - I'm asking questions
of the sort that I get
3425.61 in the comments, that we are going to get
3426.98 in the comment section.
3427.97 We always strive for clarity here.
3430.25 So what this tells me is that
exercising early in the day
3435.56 may have a special effect.
3438.05 I realize that some people cannot exercise
3440.12 until later in the evening,
3441.8 but you mentioned something
earlier that I want
3444.18 to cue people to, it's
very, very important.
3446.1 I don't think I've ever
mentioned this on the podcast,
3447.85 which is any kind of physical
activity will increase
3451.59 cortisol to varying degrees.
3454.05 And so sometimes it's a healthy increase,
3455.58 sometimes it's an unhealthy increase.
3456.97 If you do two hours of
really intense exercise
3459.1 and you're not prepared for it,
3460.56 that's a big spike in cortisol,
probably not a good thing
3464.04 for most people.
3465.17 But if you are going to
do your cardiovascular
3467.61 or weight training later in the day,
3470.15 that increase in cortisol can promote
3472.54 too much wakefulness for sleep, etc.
3475.58 Shifting that cortisol
spike early in the day
3477.51 is associated with a
number of important things
3479.25 related to mood, etc.
3482.04 But more and more, what
I'm thinking and hearing
3485.13 is that exercise early in the day is key.
3487.1 Our former dean of the
medical school, Phil Pizzo,
3490.11 was and is kind of
famous still for jogging
3494.09 between the hours of, like, 4 and 5:00 AM,
3496.27 or five and six, and then
running the medical school.
3499.9 And you're up early doing your
exercise, and cold shower,
3503.12 and meditation, we'll
talk about meditation,
3505.1 but this is more and more
of a push, I feel like,
3508.27 or a stimulus for us to think about moving
3511.61 our exercise earlier in the day.
3513.25 - Yeah, I mean, I like to say that,
3516.495 I know there are moms and dads
out there and they just say,
3520.29 look, I have a kid, the
kid's more important
3522.84 than my doing my exercise.
3524.46 So you will get benefits if
you do it whenever you can.
3529.54 So that's great, more power to you.
3532.08 But what all the neuroscience
data suggests is the best time
3536.56 to do your exercise is
right before you need
3539.81 to use your brain in
the most important way
3542.65 that you need to use it every day.
3544.16 And so that is why the morning
for most of us is beneficial.
3548.8 That's why I do it in the morning
3550.02 and I'm lucky enough
to be able to do that.
3552.89 But yeah, it makes sense with all,
3556.16 everything we know about how this works
3558.41 and how it benefits our brain.
3560.18 - I think about our
colleague, Eric Kandel,
3563.94 who not incidentally has a
Nobel Prize and studies memory.
3567.56 And rumor has it that he's been a swimmer
3572.18 for a lot of years.
3573.307 That he'll put in, I think
nowadays he's in his '90s,
3575.77 now he'll put in half a mile,
3578.33 but he used to do swim a mile a day
3580.27 or something of that sort.
3581.103 - Wow, I heard that, too,
that he was a swimmer
3582.91 and he does it very, very religiously.
3584.85 - Okay, so there are a
few other neuroscientists
3586.73 that do that, I can think
of a lot of neuroscientists
3588.56 that probably should exercise more.
3590.03 And I don't say that to poke at them,
3591.36 I just would love to see them
doing their incredible work
3593.73 for many more decades.
3595.61 And everything that we're
talking about today indicates
3596.78 that if one doesn't, unless
you have incredible genetics,
3602.29 we all experience
age-related dementia, right.
3605.38 I mean, the story of your
father is a salient one.
3609.33 And we should remember
that as we go forward.
3612.07 I also want to emphasize, and
I'd love to get your thoughts
3614.5 on just memory and memory loss in general.
3617.82 It seems we all get worse at remembering
3620.66 and learning things, even
if we don't get Alzheimer's.
3624.56 When does that typically start for humans?
3627.6 - You know, I think there's
so much variability,
3631.52 not only because we are individuals,
3634.64 but because our stress
levels are different
3639.33 and, well, everybody's
anxiety level has gone up
3643.26 in the last couple of years,
but that also has an effect.
3646.85 We don't remember as much
in a highly stressful,
3650.33 highly anxious situation.
3652.41 So, as you know, it's hard
to answer that question.
3656.392 People say, okay, just tell me
3657.56 how much exercise I have to do.
3658.83 - 30 to 45 minutes a day.
3661.35 But I love that per day,
3663.44 I've been doing this whole
thing of telling people, oh,
3665.57 the data say 150 to 200
minutes of zone two cardio,
3669.46 which is kind of moderately hard
3671.54 but not excessively hard, but
I love this everyday theme.
3676.07 Because whenever I do that,
the questions that come back
3678.38 are, well, what if I take a
long hike on the weekends?
3680.44 And so people start negotiating.
3682.13 There's something that's very powerful
3683.32 about non-negotiable, everyday.
3685.43 Sun in your eyes every day
even through cloud cover.
3687.57 Exercise for 30 to 45 minutes.
3689.71 Cold shower every day.
- Every day, yeah.
3694.03 - My understanding of the
literature is that somewhere
3697.42 in our 50s or 60s, we start noticing
3700.31 little hiccups in memory,
3703.13 for some people younger,
for some people later.
3706.33 But I have to imagine
that doing the exercise
3709.97 throughout one's entire
life is going to help
3712.16 offset some of this
simply 'cause of the BDNF
3714.917 and other downstream effects.
3716.65 - Yeah, I mean, that's what it suggests.
3719.79 One of my favorite studies,
3721.34 and then I want to get back to you wanted,
3723.78 you invited me to share
some of my unpublished data
3726.72 on the effects of long-term exercise,
3728.95 but first I want to share
one of my favorite studies,
3731.61 which is a longitudinal
study done in Swedish women.
3736.54 And this was published in 2018.
3738.95 And what they did was back in the 1960s,
3742.8 they found Swedish women,
3745.337 300 Swedish women in their 40s.
3747.73 And they characterized them
as low fit, mid fit, high fit.
3751.58 Okay, and then 40 years later,
3753.59 they came back and found these women,
3754.91 they let them do, live their lives.
3757.18 And they asked what happened
to these women as a function
3760.37 of whether they were low fit, mid fit,
3762.36 high fit in their 40s,
they're now in their 80s.
3766.18 And what they found was
that relative to the low fit
3771.53 or mid fit women, the
women that were high fit
3775.98 gained nine more years of
good cognition later in life.
3783.14 Now this is not a
randomized controlled study.
3786.25 This is a correlational study.
3788.46 But does it agree with everything
3790.33 that we've been talking about today?
3792.64 Yes, does it agree with
this idea that the women
3795.64 that were high fit were
giving their brains
3797.8 this bubble bath, maybe not every day,
3801.39 but very, very regularly
for that entire 40 years
3804.53 and that built up their big,
fat, beautiful hippocampi?
3808.05 Yes, it does.
3809.06 So that's one of my favorite studies.
3811.6 - Yeah, another cause for getting
3815.66 the exercise in consistently.
3819.04 I am impressed by this 10-minute walk
3822.18 and the improvements in mood
from just a 10-minute walk.
3825.77 But again, I think that
daily repetition also
3830.44 I have to imagine has
effects on the very pathways
3834.84 that allow plasticity.
3836.11 This is something we, in the
realm of neuroplasticity,
3838.76 we don't often hear about or think about,
3840.56 even as a neuroscientist,
which is that the pathways
3842.98 for engaging plasticity probably can be,
3845.64 probably I'm speculating
here, can be made better
3849.12 by engaging in the sorts of behavior
3851.19 that stimulate plasticity.
3852.52 In other words, if one gets
better at calming themselves
3854.3 down under stress, those circuits
get better at doing that.
3857.131 - Yes, absolutely.
- Neural circuits
3859.23 gain proficiency.
3861.041 And so, because blood vessels can grow,
3863.61 capillaries can grow in the brain,
3865.44 you can imagine that more
pumping of blood to the brain,
3869.3 delivery of these various
muscle and liver factors
3873.58 would also establish larger
or more efficient portals
3878.02 to getting that stuff there.
3879.55 So you could imagine kind
of an amplifying effect
3882.65 of exercise, and again,
I'm speculating here,
3884.42 but I've seen this over and
over again in colleagues,
3887.4 the ones who exercise consistently
3890.38 seem to be really, really
smart and doing amazing work
3893.4 well into their 80s and 90s
3895.23 and the ones who aren't, some of whom
3897.55 actually pride themselves
on how little they exercise,
3901.48 they get worse over time.
3903.18 You see them each meeting,
each decade and I'm not poking
3906.03 fun at them at all, it's actually
quite, quite hard to see.
3908.96 And they're kind of a fading light,
3910.36 they're starting to flicker.
3912.3 So there is this incredible relationship
3913.96 between body vitality and brain vitality.
3916.97 That, of course, is not
an excuse for spending
3919.06 all day in the gym.
3920.7 The gym rats, I enjoy working
out so I could imagine
3924.99 doing that, but that
doesn't make us smarter,
3928.27 unfortunately you actually have to do
3929.55 the cognitive work also,
3931.41 it's not just exercise.
3933.14 So I'd love to hear about some of these
3934.47 new unpublished data.
3935.86 - Yeah, okay, so when I
jumped into the exercise work,
3940.85 everybody was studying people 65 or older
3944.85 because that's when
cognitive decline begins.
3947.42 And if the idea is exercise can help you
3949.8 with your cognition, then makes sense.
3952.32 However, I thought, well,
you know that it's great,
3957.532 there's lots of work there.
3958.76 I wanted to know what happens
in people in their 40s
3962.607 and their 50s, maybe even
their 30s and their 20s.
3966.36 Why, because that's when
we, as humans are able,
3970.64 ready, willing, and able
to increase our exercise
3974.18 and gets us set up to build our brains
3978.55 as we go into our 60s.
3980.51 And so the first study
that I did looked at
3985.12 low fit participants from
their 30s to mid 50s,
3990.68 and we wanted to ask this question,
3994.17 how much exercise do you really need
3995.71 to start seeing benefits?
3997.07 Do you see benefits?
3997.92 Or maybe you have to wait
until you start seeing
4000.13 cognitive decline to get benefits.
4002.15 That was one of the theories out there.
4004.54 And so that's what I wanted to do.
4006.41 And so what we did was three
months of two to three times
4010.93 a week cardio, it was a spin class,
4014.17 so spin classes are great for cardio.
4016.53 And the comparison group was
two to three times a week
4019.84 of competitive video Scrabble.
4022.58 So no heart rate change, but
they had to come into my lab
4026.99 and be in a group just
like they were in a group
4029.1 for the spin class.
4033.0 We touched them cognitively
at the beginning
4035.307 and the end of the session.
4037.02 What we found was two to
three times a week of cardio
4041.47 in these people, they are low
fit, which means specifically
4045.01 that they were exercising
less than 30 minutes a week
4048.55 for the three months
previous to the experiment.
4051.62 So they went from that to
two to three times a week
4054.03 of spin class and what
we found was changes
4058.21 in baseline rates of their
positive mood states went up
4062.56 relative to the video Scrabble group.
4065.34 Their body image got more positive
4068.77 because they were
exercising, which is great.
4070.85 And really important, their
motivation to exercise went up
4075.48 significantly compared to
the video Scrabble group,
4078.44 which is great.
4079.64 So the more you exercise,
the more motivated
4082.16 you are to exercise.
4083.84 What about cognition?
4084.78 What changed in the cognitive
circuits of their brain?
4087.99 Number one, we got improved
performance on the Stroop task,
4091.91 but we're headed towards
my favorite structure,
4095.3 which is the hippocampus.
4097.01 What we found was improved
performance on both
4100.8 a recognition memory
task, which was a memory
4104.52 and coding task, and that
is, can you differentiate
4111.1 similar items that we're
asking you to remember,
4114.595 and a spatial episodic memory task,
4117.85 where we had them play one
of those Doom like games
4120.83 when they went into this
spatial maze and they had
4123.25 to do things in a virtual city.
4125.48 Their performance there got better,
4127.08 which is very, very classically dependent
4129.57 on the hippocampus.
4132.165 So this, it was so
satisfying to do this study
4136.03 because I've been wanting
to answer this question,
4139.53 what is a minimum amount or
doable amount of exercise
4145.25 that will get you these
cognitive benefits?
4147.67 And now I can say in 30-to-50-year
olds that are low fit,
4153.36 two to three times a week.
4154.68 Is that doable, absolutely.
4156.71 Will it be hard if you're low fit, yeah,
4158.57 it's going to be challenging,
but absolutely doable.
4162.2 And so it makes sense
with all of the mechanisms
4168.53 that we are, I didn't study the
mechanisms just to be clear,
4171.52 but with all the mechanisms
we are imagining are playing
4175.4 a role here, that absolutely
makes sense and it is doable.
4179.52 This is not like you have
to become marathon runner
4183.22 to get any of these benefits.
4185.1 This is you have to start moving your body
4187.15 on a regular basis two
to three times a week.
4191.26 So I love that for its realness.
4194.79 - How long are those sessions again?
4196.42 - 45 Minutes.
- 45 Minutes.
4197.68 - Yeah, 45 minutes, it's a
typical spin kind of class.
4202.38 There's a warmup for five
minutes and a cool down
4204.37 for five minutes, so
it's really 35 minutes
4210.28 of they're really pushing you.
4213.15 - And so they're
breathing reasonably hard.
4215.27 Heart rate is up.
4216.972 - Heart rate is up definitely up, yeah
4219.18 - I find that all of those
results are really interesting
4222.283 that the results showing
improvement in motivation
4227.16 to exercise is interesting,
'cause it gets back
4229.35 to this issue of kind of
a self-amplifying effect.
4231.97 And the neuroscientist
in me wants to think
4236.19 about kind of pre-motor
circuits and the fact that
4239.47 we have a motor system that
can obviously do things
4242.24 like lift cups, and walk, and
run if we want to or need to,
4245.79 but that it's possible to create
4248.5 a kind of anticipatory
activity in our nervous system
4251.75 where our body craves a certain stimulus,
4255.31 you mentioned the cold and
how you crave the cold.
4257.64 Now whether or not that's the adrenaline,
4259.46 and the dopamine, etc.,
or whether or not somebody
4262.86 who exercises, going from
zero, less than 30 minutes
4266.89 per week to two to three
times a week, 45 minutes,
4269.89 as you described for this study.
4273.293 I've had that experience
before of that the cardio,
4277.343 that I tend to battle the most,
4280.12 I love lifting heavy objects,
at least heavy for me.
4283.66 I'm happy to go to the gym every other day
4286.04 and just lift heavy objects for an hour.
4287.53 It just makes me happy,
I like the way it feels,
4289.8 and I've been doing it since I
was in my teens, so 30 years.
4293.69 Cardio's a little bit trickier.
4294.68 I like to run, but if I stop
running for a little while
4298.41 I find it very hard to get back into.
4300.21 But if I start running three times a week
4302.3 for 30 to 45 minutes and I
do this pretty consistently
4305.3 on the days I don't weight train,
4306.77 I find that I start to crave it.
4308.69 It's almost as if my body
needs that in order to,
4312.36 I always say, clear out the cobwebs,
4313.87 but it's like my mind
doesn't function as well,
4315.73 clearly now I understand
why and why exercise helps,
4319.8 but also physically I almost
feel like my body needs
4323.11 to engage in that movement.
4324.21 Like the pre-motor circuits
are kind of revving,
4326.8 kind of like revving then engine
on a car while it's in park.
4330.72 So the motivation to exercise obviously
4332.84 could be multifaceted.
4334.77 It could be purely psychological,
4336.52 but do you think there's any
reason to speculate at least
4339.34 or believe that we can
build an anticipatory,
4344.197 reverbatory activity
into our nervous system?
4346.22 - Yeah, yeah,
4349.981 I agree with that because I
also have those same kinds
4353.76 of thoughts and I do have
anticipatory exercise
4359.47 when I can't do it.
4360.64 So I just got back from a
week and a half in Paris,
4364.79 where I got to do a book launch
4366.6 of my last book, "Good Anxiety."
4368.66 And I really walked around a lot,
4374.04 but I did not do my exercise
for that whole week and a half.
4379.56 But there was a lot of
stress 'cause I had to do
4381.26 all these interviews in French.
4382.3 So I gave myself a break.
4383.46 - You speak French?
- I speak French.
4385.08 - I was going to say, otherwise
it would be really stressful.
4386.203 - That would be really stressful.
4387.4 - Then I'd be really impressed.
4389.023 Then I would definitely start exercising.
4391.63 Actually, I would follow
your morning routine to a T,
4394.36 but okay, very impressive nonetheless.
4396.74 - But I got back and coming
back this direction from Paris,
4402.08 I live in New York, is much easier.
4405.36 And so I was able to get up
at a normal time the next day.
4408.57 And that exercise session
that first day is like, okay,
4411.25 I'm back in my home, I'm
back in my environment.
4414.27 And it felt so good.
4416.29 It was like I wanted to come back.
4419.8 And I know it's because
I worked up over years,
4424.35 now I could truthfully
say seven days a week,
4427.06 but it was first it was four to five,
4430.28 then it was five to six, and yeah, seven,
4434.45 but that includes a yoga day,
4436.2 or sometimes I have to
do it for 10 minutes
4437.79 instead of 30 because I have to leave.
4440.4 But that habit of you do
that even for five minutes,
4444.93 you do either the weight 10-minute thing,
4448.04 or a five-minute thing, or a
stretch, that is a tiny habit.
4454.07 Is that somebody at Stanford
that invented this idea
4456.84 of tiny habits, I thought it was?
4458.79 - Well, we've got a
number of people there.
4461.346 And I apologize in
advance to all the people
4463.27 I neglect in this statement, but I'm happy
4465.93 to put it in the comments, folks.
4468.5 BJ Fogg is there, has done--
- Yes, that's who I,
4472.3 - BJ's done really great work.
4474.59 And then James Clear
wrote a book about habits
4478.13 and has a very popular
newsletter about habits.
4480.85 We've done an episode
about habits that covers
4482.52 some of their work and some
of the more laboratory-ish,
4487.22 not ish, laboratory science,
peer-reviewed work on it.
4490.52 Daily behaviors, also
daily behaviors performed
4493.32 at roughly the same time of day.
4495.35 I mean, one thing we know for sure is that
4497.86 the circadian system is part
of our nervous system's way
4502.01 of anticipating when things will happen,
4503.867 not just what will happen.
4505.32 I'm telling you things you
obviously know already,
4507.9 but for the audience.
4509.09 Performing your exercise at
roughly the same time each day
4512.66 will make it easier as
opposed to just saying,
4514.88 I'm going to do it seven
days a week sometime today.
4517.06 But of course, getting it
done sometime is better
4519.27 than not getting it done.
4520.103 - Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
4522.74 - Well, those are impressive
effects and I love that
4525.27 you're starting to look
in populations that are
4527.39 a bit younger, not because
some of these older populations
4530.97 aren't important, but I think
that building good habits in
4534.86 across one's entire life
is really what it's about.
4538.41 As I always say with
anything related to longevity
4541.42 or offsetting an age-related
decline, we don't know,
4546.09 it's hard to know if things work
4547.28 because there's no within subject control.
4550.867 But what we also know for
sure is that you don't want
4553.25 to be the control experiment.
4555.0 - Exactly.
- You absolutely don't
4556.42 want to be the control experiment,
4557.83 especially for something
that's purely behavioral.
4560.51 I mean, you're not talking about ingesting
4562.26 a particular supplement.
4563.37 You're not talking about
changing your diet in any way.
4566.11 But I am curious diet is
a very barbed wire topic
4571.42 on the internet, which diets
whether or not they work, etc.,
4575.64 but in general, in any of these studies,
4578.69 do they evaluate whether
or not people change
4580.37 their eating habits when
they start to exercise more?
4582.96 - Yeah, I think I've seen
one study that controlled
4588.36 for that, but I feel for
them because it's hard enough
4592.26 to get people to exercise at
the level and at the time,
4598.278 that you need for your study.
4600.1 If you also ask them, okay,
4601.63 fill out this survey to
tell us exactly what you ate
4603.89 all day, they're going to say, forget you,
4606.7 I'm not joining your study.
4608.69 So it's a critical question.
4611.3 And again, there's only
been one that I've seen
4615.36 and the evidence was that diets got better
4619.18 when they, you know, less processed foods,
4621.43 when they did adhere to this exercise.
4623.83 But lot more information needs
to be gathered in that realm.
4628.55 The second study that I
wanted to share unpublished,
4631.21 we're writing it up right
now, is part two of that study
4635.63 that I just described, which
was the low fit people.
4638.48 Next we move to mid fit
people, like what about us,
4641.31 we're already exercising,
4644.08 am I going to benefit from
increasing my exercise?
4647.65 So here again we collaborated
with a great spin studio
4651.87 that had a whole bunch of mid fit people
4654.0 that by our definition were
exercising two to three times
4658.15 a week on a regular basis.
4659.75 That's great, all you people
out there that are doing that,
4662.25 you should know you're
already benefiting your brain.
4665.27 But our question was what if
we invited them to exercise
4668.97 as much as they wanted at the
spin studio for three months,
4673.02 from two to three times all the way
4674.89 up to seven times a week, and
let's just see what happened.
4678.17 And the control group, we asked them
4681.81 not to change their exercise.
4684.33 And so what we ended up
with was a nice big array
4689.26 of starting with mid
fit people that exercise
4693.18 between staying at two
to three times a week,
4695.29 all the way up to seven times a week.
4697.5 And the bottom line from that study
4700.19 is every drop of sweat counted.
4703.56 That is, the more you change
and you increase your workout
4707.42 up to seven times a week,
4709.15 the better your mood was,
you had lower amounts
4714.529 of depression and anxiety,
higher amounts of good effect,
4719.67 and the better your hippocampal memory was
4723.19 with the more you worked out,
4725.04 again, this was for three months.
4726.97 So I love that too, because it gives power
4730.947 to those of us that are regularly
exercising and wondering,
4734.55 do I really need to?
4736.08 I mean, is it really going to help me?
4737.55 And the answer is yes.
4738.63 I mean, not all of us can exercise,
4740.64 go to a spin class seven times a week,
4743.28 but I love the message that
our body is responsive to that.
4748.65 And you can get better
hippocampal function,
4751.64 better overall baseline mood affect
4755.5 with a higher level.
4756.5 So it works for the
mid fit people as well.
4760.53 - Fantastic, the more I learn from you,
4762.77 the more I'm starting to
conceptualize the brain as an organ
4765.94 that is privileged in so many ways,
4768.61 has this unique blood-brain barrier,
4771.4 has this incredible quality of
being able to predict things,
4775.2 and it's job mainly is, of
course, to predict things
4777.74 among other functions, of course,
4780.2 but that our brain isn't
necessarily going to stay stable
4785.89 or get better over time,
that it needs a signal.
4791.83 It isn't sufficient to just
say that we can't take it
4793.29 for granted, that our
brain is actually an organ
4796.81 that requires a signal
in order to maintain
4799.64 its own function and it sounds
like enhanced blood flow
4803.23 and these pathways that
you described earlier,
4805.23 these two pathways are at least among
4808.33 the more critical signals.
4810.5 I'm tempted now to move my frequency
4813.43 of cardiovascular exercise from,
4815.09 I confess it's about three
days, 35 minutes lately,
4818.97 and it should be more to daily.
4822.14 There's something really, again,
really special about daily
4824.33 because it's nonnegotiable,
you just do it.
4828.36 And it sounds like if one were to do
4829.98 higher intensity exercise,
you know in a spin class,
4833.02 I've never taken a spin
class, but I've seen
4834.63 there are times when they're
standing up on the bike
4836.19 and pedaling very hard.
4837.4 So that is included in these
kinds of workouts, right?
4839.87 - Absolutely, yeah.
- Okay.
4840.75 - I mean, that's what
the instructor is doing.
4843.6 I cannot control.
4845.8 We did monitor heart rate of
all the subjects and it was
4849.84 clearly, compared to the video Scrabble,
4852.71 it was highly significant.
4854.14 - I would hope so.
- Yes.
4856.075 - I guess it depends on how intense
4856.908 that game of Scrabble is.
4859.96 Could we just briefly talk
about mindset and affirmations?
4864.93 - Yeah, sure.
- You've talked
4865.763 a bit before about affirmations,
4869.1 and as you mentioned, the
beautiful work of my colleague
4872.39 at Stanford, Alia Crum,
4875.1 we can summarize her work pretty simply,
4876.97 although we won't do it
complete justice by it,
4878.6 she's already been on the podcast,
4880.14 just to say that one's
beliefs about a behavior
4884.15 also impact the outcomes of that behavior.
4886.67 If you learn a lot of true
facts about stress being good
4891.45 for you, then you'll experience
stress as better for you
4895.16 then if you only focus on or learn about
4897.5 the negative effects of stress.
4898.57 If you learn about the
positive effects of exercise,
4900.95 you actually derive greater
benefit from exercise,
4904.03 believe it or not.
4905.25 It's incredible, incredible effects,
4907.07 but they make sense when you understand
4908.68 what the brain is doing,
4909.55 which is a lot of this
predictive coding and mindsets
4912.57 don't seem as mysterious and woo anymore
4914.9 once you understand what
the brain is really doing.
4917.02 But what is, if any,
4920.13 the value of affirmation
of telling yourself
4924.47 something positive about yourself,
4926.64 or of exercise, on not
the exercise itself,
4930.3 but on mood, self image,
memory, and brain function?
4934.628 - Yeah, so, I looked into
this because I am also
4941.09 a certified exercise instructor
and the form of exercise
4943.58 that I teach is called IntenSati.
4947.17 It's a form of exercise that was developed
4948.99 by this amazing instructor,
Patricia Moreno.
4953.13 And she combined physical
movements from kickbox,
4956.27 and dance, and yoga, and martial arts
4958.61 with positive spoken affirmations.
4961.06 So each move, if you're
punching back and forth,
4963.01 as you would do in a kickbox class,
4965.27 you don't just punch,
you say something like
4967.53 I am strong now, which every punch
4970.57 is associated with a word.
4972.07 And you know, you can create
your own series of affirmations
4977.08 with the moves that you put together.
4979.16 And the first time I did it, I
just wandered into her class,
4982.94 I didn't know what it
was and I felt idiotic,
4987.225 I was like what, I came
into the wrong class,
4989.42 I don't want to come into this class.
4991.49 But then I saw they didn't
care whether I thought
4996.048 they looked silly saying these affir-,
4998.09 not saying, yelling these
affirmations out loud
5001.52 while doing the choreography
at the same time.
5004.4 And then I tried it,
okay, I didn't yell out,
5007.08 I kind of whispered it at first.
5009.92 But by the end, I was
really yelling it out.
5012.38 There's something about the declaration,
5014.68 using your own voice of saying things that
5017.81 you don't often say to
yourself, like I'm strong,
5021.88 I'm inspired, I believe I will succeed,
5024.51 are all the kinds of affirmations you say.
5027.01 And you walk out of that class,
5028.63 or I walked out of that class,
5030.31 thinking, ah, I feel really good now.
5034.64 Man, I can't wait to
come back to this class.
5037.36 Which is why I ultimately
took teacher training
5040.29 to be able to teach that class.
5042.37 And so I started to
look into what was known
5047.27 about affirmations and
they were never combined
5050.04 with physical activity, but
it was clear that there was
5054.2 a literature showing that
positive affirmations,
5058.04 saying them or reading
them could change mood
5061.95 in the same way as we're talking about,
5063.54 you know, Alia Crum's work.
5065.4 If you have this, it's a belief,
5069.14 once you start saying these things,
5070.79 these are not difficult things to believe,
5074.5 but it's amazing how much you don't say
5078.04 these kinds of things to
yourself or with your own voice.
5081.58 You might say them about somebody else,
5083.17 oh, you're strong, you're so smart.
5085.72 Do you say that about yourself?
5087.25 And that's the thing about
the self affirmations.
5090.66 It really gets you into a habit
5094.362 of saying good things about yourself.
5096.74 And then you start to realize,
5098.65 oh my God, I'm so mean to myself.
5101.67 I have lots of negative thoughts going on
5104.8 about myself in my head, and which is part
5108.46 of the other reason why I loved this,
5110.44 this particular form of exercise.
5113.32 So what you get in
IntenSati is the mood boost
5118.36 from the positive spoken affirmations
5120.84 together with all the other
brain and affect boosts
5125.22 that we've been talking
about for this whole podcast,
5128.74 from the exercise, because
it's a sweaty workout as well.
5132.41 - Interesting, there's a book,
I confess I haven't read it,
5135.63 but I have had the pleasure
of having a discussion
5138.13 with a psychologist from,
5139.15 I believe he's at University
of Michigan in Ann Arbor,
5142.24 Ethan Kross wrote a book called "Chatter,"
5144.87 which focuses on the fact that so much
5148.3 of our inner dialogue,
it is indeed negative.
5150.84 He certainly wasn't the
first to point that out.
5154.37 But that explicit statements to counter
5157.63 that negative chatter, I
believe is one of the hallmarks
5161.21 of readjusting one's own, not
just internal reference frame,
5165.15 but actually self-image generally.
5167.39 And it's a fascinating and, I
think, a very important area
5171.55 of psychology and neuroscience because,
5173.94 and I acknowledge this,
we're talking about this,
5176.01 two laboratory neuroscientists
who record from neurons
5179.16 and label neurons and look
at stuff down the microscope,
5182.02 we are now deep in the
territory, in the deep water
5185.36 of what some of our colleagues
and people who think
5188.46 about neuroscience would
consider really out there
5190.64 on the kind of subjective edges.
5193.3 And yet I think it's worth pointing out
5196.78 that the brain does all these things.
5199.51 It's responsible for simple
reflexes and motor behaviors,
5201.95 but also high-level conceptual
ideas about the universe
5206.21 and what it might look like in 10 years,
5207.67 or 100 years, or 1,000 years,
5209.3 but also high-level
conceptual understanding
5212.04 of who we are and what we are about.
5215.01 And so even though it
might seem a little bit
5217.03 out on the fringes, dare I say,
5219.59 I think that these are
some of the more important
5222.075 untread landscapes of neuroscience.
5224.43 And I just want to
acknowledge my appreciation
5227.5 for the fact that I'm going to
connect the dots here and say,
5231.92 you went from somebody
who didn't exercise,
5233.73 who went on this rafting trip,
5235.41 That discovered exercise and its benefits
5237.56 for your grant writing
and then on and on and on,
5240.74 and then became a certified
5243.08 - Exercise instructor.
- Instructor.
5245.04 So you don't do anything
halfway, either as it's clear.
5250.46 I'd like to touch on something
you mentioned earlier,
5253.61 but we haven't dove into
it all in any depth,
5257.47 which is meditation.
5260.96 You mentioned this tea meditation.
5262.79 You had a publication recently
5265.14 on a 10-minute meditation.
5267.35 - Yes.
- Right?
5268.2 Maybe you could tell us about
this 10-minute meditation
5270.546 because it seems like such
at tractable amount of time.
5273.95 And then if you would
maybe tell us a little bit
5275.7 about the tea meditation.
5276.7 But sounds like you've
discovered a minimum,
5280.84 a close to minimum threshold of meditation
5283.611 that can really benefit us.
5285.895 So maybe you could tell
us about that study.
5287.71 - So the study was, as you
very astutely pointed out,
5292.75 very practical study,
5294.98 just 10 minutes, not 30
minutes, not an hour meditation,
5298.33 that's too hard, 10
minutes guided meditation.
5301.75 They logged into a site.
5302.95 So we can tell that they logged
in and they listened to a,
5306.65 it's a body scan, very basic,
5309.14 but easy to follow kind of meditation.
5312.19 And we asked them to do it, how often?
5315.56 Daily, seven days a week,
just 10 minutes a day.
5319.27 And the most shocking thing
about this study is that
5322.43 we got more adherence to the
10 minute daily meditation
5327.86 than the 10 minute
daily podcast listening,
5330.71 which was our control.
5331.92 So the highest retention
rate I've ever gotten in any,
5335.98 this kind of study that I've
done, exercise or meditation,
5339.0 they wanted to do it 10 minutes a day.
5341.72 It was great.
5342.753 - I'm going to just
start leading meditations
5344.84 for three hours as opposed to
doing a three-hour podcast.
5349.24 - So we looked at cognitive
effects before and after this,
5355.11 it was eight weeks of daily,
5357.61 it was actually 12-minute meditation,
5360.627 12 minutes of body scan meditation.
5362.19 And what we found was
significant decreases
5366.63 in stress response.
5367.75 So we did the stress test
to see how you responded
5372.79 to an unexpected, stressful situation.
5375.36 The meditators did much better.
5377.81 Their mood was better and
their cognitive performance
5381.89 was also better.
5383.53 And this was my first
little foray into meditation
5387.55 after I had started my
personal tea meditation,
5394.35 that really shifted my
relationship with meditation.
5401.269 But it is consistent with
many other studies showing
5404.36 the beneficial effects of meditation.
5408.14 But the unique thing was
we tried to make it doable
5411.23 that many, many people out
there could actually follow
5414.4 this typical regimen, and
so we're continuing that.
5421.16 In fact, my research in my
lab right now is all about
5425.77 those doable, short things
that NYU college students
5430.87 will do, not just at the
beginning of the semester,
5434.27 but at the end of the
semester when the stress
5437.45 and anxiety levels are now at
record-breaking high levels.
5441.61 And they need something to
bring that level down so that
5445.12 they could show their professors
5446.84 what their brains can actually do.
5449.05 And so it includes very short meditations,
5451.5 sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking,
5456.33 things that any college student,
5458.44 but we're obviously focused
on NYU students, will do.
5463.95 I want to get at graduation rates.
5466.23 I want to get at class performance
5469.03 with these kinds of interventions.
5471.74 But it started with that study
5472.95 that I just described, meditation.
5477.19 - If you would, and here's where we can
5480.46 highlight this again, as some
highly educated speculation,
5484.81 if it's coming from you.
5486.73 What do you think is going
on during meditation?
5489.11 I mean, so a body skin involves
5490.91 a kind of a interoceptive awareness,
5493.44 like interoception, of
course, being an attention
5495.81 to what's going on on the surface of
5497.81 and within the confines of our skin
5499.27 as opposed to the outside world.
5502.89 Drawing our attention to
anything inside us or outside us
5506.38 involves forebrain function,
prefrontal cortex presumably,
5509.36 and other things,
typically eyes are closed,
5512.51 typically it's relaxing.
5513.87 So there are a lot of
variables that could be feeding
5515.9 into a number of different effects.
5518.53 But as a neuroscientist,
what do you think is going on
5523.776 that this period of
kind of an self-induced,
5527.72 somewhat unusual state, what
do you think is going on
5532.25 in terms of network behavior
and networks within the brain
5536.43 that it can have these long-term effects?
5538.61 Because we got to some
of the ones downstream
5540.61 of exercise and I think
there's so much evidence,
5546.09 I know there's so much evidence
5547.21 that meditation is beneficial.
5549.69 How do you think it's working
5551.23 or what do you think it's doing?
5552.64 - Yeah, I think that one of
the most important things
5556.47 that gets worked when we
are doing a simple 10 minute
5561.39 or 12 minute body scan
meditation regularly,
5565.06 this 10 minutes a day, 12 minutes a day
5567.73 is the habit building and
the practice of focusing
5573.69 on the present moment.
5576.41 I think that is very hard
for us modern humans to do,
5580.61 because I'm worrying
about the thing that's due
5585.305 at the end of the week that I need to do
5587.76 and how many hours am I going
to have to be able to do that.
5590.81 Or I'm worried about,
whatever, the email that wasn't
5594.62 as polite as it should be that I sent
5596.33 and what were the repercussions for that
5599.33 instead of focusing on
this moment, which is fun,
5605.09 I get to talk to you, it's
a beautiful day outside,
5609.6 I'm feeling good right at this moment.
5612.04 And I think that those,
5613.68 all of the meditative
practices that I've done,
5619.27 and this one also, whether
you know it or not,
5623.39 is getting you to focus on this moment.
5628.28 And I think it's even more
important in this day and age
5632.11 where anxiety levels and the
next variant might come out
5635.94 and what are the repercussions there?
5637.64 And I have a mother who's older
and she's more susceptible
5641.12 to it, and there's a war, and
what's going to happen there?
5645.58 Those are all future possibilities.
5649.16 And we should be worried about that.
5651.43 That is a possibility,
you need to plan for that.
5654.22 But you also need to focus
on this moment right now.
5659.13 I'm healthy, I can breathe,
5661.64 I get to have this
interesting conversation
5664.06 right in this moment.
5664.97 If I start thinking about other things,
5666.94 then it takes away from this moment.
5670.2 Do I know what circuits are involved?
5674.72 Not exactly, that is not my area.
5676.61 I think there are some studies
that have focused on that,
5680.003 that present moment kind of activity.
5684.12 But that is what I think is most important
5687.057 about the practice of meditation
5689.06 or one of the important
things that calms us down.
5692.91 Because if you know how to do that,
5694.85 that gives you this powerful
tool for the rest of your day.
5698.85 You're not locked into that
fearful future thinking
5703.06 that so many of us have,
or that just reliving
5706.287 of the terrible past, but you could
5709.33 enjoy the present moment.
5712.31 - Yeah, that really resonates.
5714.15 I think that going back
to the earlier part
5716.7 of our conversation,
5718.21 the hippocampus has this
incredible storage capacity
5722.4 and ability to set context
about past, present, and future.
5725.97 And that's a beautiful thing
because as much as I like
5729.58 to think he had some
semblance of a healthy life,
5732.26 none of us want to HM,
5733.84 none of us want to be in the
position of not being able
5736.01 to form new memories and have no context
5738.04 to the past or the present.
5740.25 So we're grateful that,
we should all be grateful
5742.67 that our hippocampus can draw
from past, present, and future
5746.21 in various combinations
and we should support it
5748.27 through the daily
exercise and other habits,
5752.13 let's call them habits, so
that people make them habits
5754.32 now that you've highlighted.
5755.49 But if we are not deliberately
anchoring within past,
5759.51 present, and future
according to what we need,
5763.34 and we're just shuffling between
past, present, and future,
5766.4 that is not a good way to live.
5768.6 - No.
- It's not effective.
5770.12 - No.
- It sounds like meditation
5771.57 can really help us go to the right stacks.
5775.04 I guess people don't go
to libraries anymore,
5777.52 but in the old days you would
go to the right location
5780.06 in the library, you actually
can't get distracted
5781.87 by the books that you're interested in,
5783.47 if you need to go just reflexively,
5785.49 if you need to go study
a particular topic.
5787.37 So that's kind of how I think about it.
5789.33 It makes us more linear
perhaps in our way of being.
5793.11 - I think so, and it actually counteracts,
5796.83 not that I'm against technology,
5798.63 but having our phones and being connected
5801.97 to every good and bad thing
going on in the world today
5807.86 is incredibly distracting
and takes you away
5811.08 from the present moment
virtually 24 hours a day.
5814.85 And so we have to work extra
hard right now compared to
5818.64 in the '40s when we didn't
have all this technology
5821.15 or at the same level.
5822.5 So yeah, it becomes even
more important practice,
5826.28 I think, for everyday life.
5827.99 - Yeah, or even 10, 15 years ago
5831.31 it felt like smartphones
weren't as intrusive.
5834.69 One final question and maybe a request.
5839.55 As the new incoming dean of
College of Letters and Sciences,
5843.05 and I must say I'm delighted,
thrilled actually to hear
5846.64 that a lot of the practices
that we've been discussing today
5849.72 and that you've pioneered
are going to be incorporated
5851.96 into undergraduate education.
5853.77 I predict, and I'd be willing
to wager that that will become
5856.7 a template for how universities
and non-university systems
5860.95 should function because if
indeed the, and it is true,
5864.84 that there's this incredible relationship
5867.36 between physical movement and
mental deliberate practices
5871.14 and performance, any
corporation, school, household
5875.44 would be crazy, would be self-limiting,
5879.22 and even self-destructive
to not incorporate those.
5881.7 So I'm so happy that you're going
to do this and collect data.
5885.27 Please, we'll have to touch back with you
5887.0 and hear what comes to that.
5889.57 But one of the main things
that I hear so much about today
5893.11 are issues with attention.
5895.34 And we haven't talked about attention,
5896.4 we've mainly been talking
about memory and cognition.
5898.87 But you know a lot about attention,
5903.324 and here I'm not being disparaging,
5904.28 I think people have done
what I'm about to say
5906.6 as a consequence of need
and lack of other resources.
5910.81 There's an immense amount of
Adderall use, Ritalin use,
5913.87 Modafinil use, and caffeine abuse.
5916.39 Now, I happen to like caffeine,
5917.91 I don't use the other
compounds I described,
5920.69 but it's just incredible to
me how the data on this are,
5924.89 a colleague of mine at
Stanford claims that
5926.63 something like two-thirds
or more of college students
5929.51 use these without prescription for ADHD.
5934.72 What can we expect in terms of the effects
5938.52 of regular exercise on attention?
5940.57 And are there any other
things besides exercise
5943.03 and meditation that you
would like to see people do
5945.34 in terms of trying to increase
their powers of attention?
5948.01 Because I think the
ability to focus and attend
5951.47 is really the distinguishing feature
5953.67 between those that will
succeed in any endeavor
5956.45 and those that won't.
5958.03 And that's a scary thing
for a lot of people to hear
5960.05 because a lot of people
think they have ADHD.
5962.29 They may, they may not.
5963.71 But I bet that a number of
students at both Stanford and NYU
5968.32 feel challenged with
holding their attention
5971.22 to the thing that they need
to hold their attention to.
5973.909 - Yeah, so I would say the
top three tools that everybody
5979.31 right this minute today can
use to up their capacity
5984.05 to attend where they
want to include exercise
5988.07 for the reasons we've talked about.
5989.36 It has a direct effect on functioning
5991.16 of the prefrontal cortex.
5992.17 Meditation also, clear
clinical studies showing
5995.48 improved ability to focus
5998.48 and particularly focus
on the present moment.
6001.6 And the third has to be sleep.
6003.76 So sleep is, you can't,
it's out of the three,
6008.75 it is the most physiological.
6011.0 I mean, I could live my whole life
6013.54 without meditating one minute.
6015.66 Could I survive without sleep?
6017.7 No, none of us could.
6019.27 So, it's more basic physiological,
6022.34 but it is so important for
all core cognitive functions,
6030.22 including attention, including creativity,
6032.78 including just good basic brain function.
6041.65 That is why it's so critical
to get that information,
6047.43 that basic neuroscience
information into the heads
6050.71 of these students that are
trying their best to show us
6053.92 how their brains work, but being hampered
6057.63 because they're not moving
enough, they're not meditating.
6062.26 And there's all these distracting things
6064.65 that they include in their lives.
6066.72 Some of which a little bit is good,
6069.26 but you know, 24 hours a day on your phone
6072.37 and linked in, not LinkedIn,
but linked to your phone
6078.02 is damaging to your attention.
6080.8 So exercise, meditation,
sleep can help you learn,
6087.15 retain, and perform better
than if you do not have
6091.81 these three things in your life.
6093.98 - Wonderful, music to my ears.
6096.1 And also either very
low cost or zero cost,
6100.5 considering that the exercise
doesn't require a class,
6103.83 one could use the freely
available resource of gravity
6109.491 to do jumping jacks, or burpees,
or pushups, or whatever,
6112.88 or sit ups, or all those in combination.
6114.405 - And don't forget YouTube,
6115.238 the freely accessible
millions of YouTube videos.
6119.34 If you don't want to do your
jumping jacks by yourself,
6122.41 I always say this, I talk
about breath meditation
6126.74 for my book, "Good Anxiety,"
6128.22 and if you don't like
the one that I suggest
6131.17 there's only about a
million more on YouTube
6133.17 with ratings from one star to five stars,
6136.08 so use that resource.
6138.35 - It is a wonderful resource
6140.18 and you are an amazing resource.
6143.08 Wendy, thank you so much
for coming here today
6146.05 to have this discussion
and share your knowledge
6148.92 about not just existing data,
but new data coming out soon,
6153.47 and for your leadership
in the university system,
6157.54 for your leadership in public education,
6159.37 for the decades of
important work on memory
6162.31 and neural circuitry, which we got
6164.66 to learn about today, as well.
6166.79 Thank you ever so much.
6168.32 - Thank you, Andrew, fun conversation.
6171.15 - Thank you for joining

6219.67 at the beginning of today's episode,
6221.27 that's the best way to

6227.67 And there you can support the podcast
6229.55 at any level that you like.
6231.12 On many episodes of the
Huberman Lab Podcast,
6233.06 we discuss supplements, while
supplements are certainly
6235.64 not necessary for everybody,
many people derive
6238.21 tremendous benefit from them
for things like accelerating
6241.42 the transition into sleep, and
getting better, deeper sleep,
6244.64 as well as enhancing focus and learning,
6247.01 and other aspects of human
performance and health.
6250.14 We're excited to announce
that we've partnered
6251.86 with Momentous supplements.
6253.76 The reason we partnered with
Momentous is several-fold.
6256.56 First of all, we wanted
to have one location
6259.05 where Huberman Lab Podcast
listeners could go in order
6261.39 to find all the supplements
that we talk about
6264.28 and to find those in a
form where they could
6266.78 systematically try one or the other.
6268.95 This is a real issue in
the supplement industry.
6270.64 A lot of supplement
brands out there combine
6272.51 different ingredients in ways
that don't really allow you
6275.05 to pinpoint exactly what you
need and what you don't need.
6278.13 So getting supplements
that have low doses,
6282.0 or just the minimal effective dose
6283.81 of particular ingredients, and
being able to mix and match
6286.6 those ingredients yourself,
and really establish
6288.87 what's best for you is really key.
6291.27 In addition, we came to realize
that a lot of our listeners
6293.55 want supplements, but they reside
6295.04 outside of the United States.
6296.78 So we're pleased to tell
you that Momentous ships
6298.64 both within the US and internationally.
6301.12 And of course, Momentous supplements
6302.98 are of the very highest
quality ingredients
6305.32 and the precision of the
amounts of those ingredients
6307.87 is tightly regulated.
6309.4 If you're interested in
Momentous supplements,
6311.41 the catalog of supplements related
6313.11 to the Huberman Lab Podcast
are growing all the time.
6316.49 A good number of them are already there.
6318.13 You can go to livemomentous.com/huberman
6320.89 in order to find them.
6322.17 And there will be
additional supplements added
6324.47 to that site as we go forward.
6326.39 If you're not already
following Huberman Lab
6328.3 on Twitter and Instagram,
I post neuroscience
6331.5 and other science-related information
6333.57 and tools on a regular basis.
6335.75 Some of that information
overlaps with the content
6337.86 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
but a lot of it is distinct
6340.37 from the information contained
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
6343.09 So again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram
6345.36 and Huberman Lab on Twitter.
6347.33 We also have a Neural Network Newsletter.
6350.14 What that is is a monthly
newsletter in which I distill
6353.6 critical points from
different podcast episodes,
6356.13 provide links to useful resources.
6357.95 If you want to sign up
for that newsletter,
6359.36 I should mention it is zero cost,
6361.01 and we do not share
your email with anybody,
6362.91 and we have a very clear privacy policy
6365.47 posted at hubermanlab.com,
just go to hubermanlab.com,
6369.42 click on the menu, you'll see
the Neural Network Newsletter.
6371.9 You can also look at
examples of newsletters
6373.83 without having to sign up to make sure
6375.21 that you actually do want to sign up.
6377.39 But if you are interested,
the signup is there,
6380.08 very easy and you can receive
our monthly newsletter.
6382.93 So once again, thank you for
joining me today for our voyage
6386.31 into the neuroscience of
learning and memory and tools
6389.05 to get better at learning and memory.
6391.06 And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.
