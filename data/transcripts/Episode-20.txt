0.36 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast
2.31 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
9.18 I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor
10.92 of neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.11 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.85 Today we are discussing fitness.
17.13 Fitness, of course,
17.963 is vitally important for
cardiovascular health,
20.22 for strength, for endurance,
for lifespan, for healthspan.
23.76 I can't think of anyone out
there that wouldn't want to
25.77 have healthy hormonal function,
27.9 healthy cardiovascular
function, to live a long time
30.93 and to feel vital,
31.763 that is to have a long healthspan as well
34.74 as a long lifespan.
36.54 Fitness and fitness
protocols are tremendously
39.24 powerful for developing all of that.
41.25 However, despite there
being an enormous amount
44.16 of information out there on
the internet and in books
46.62 and elsewhere, it can
be a bit overwhelming.
48.741 So today's episode is really designed
50.82 to synthesize science based
tools that we've covered
54.18 on the podcast, some
with expert guests like
56.82 Dr. Andy Galpin or Dr.
Peter Attia, or world
60.12 renowned Movement specialist Ido Portal,
62.7 or physiotherapist and strength
64.11 and conditioning coach, Jeff Cavaliere.
66.42 We've had all of them as
guests on the podcast,
68.97 and each and every one
of them provided a wealth
70.918 of knowledge in terms
of the various things
73.38 that you can do to optimize very specific
75.63 or multiple aspects of fitness.
77.82 Today, we're going to do
something a little bit
79.44 different than usual.
80.49 Typically on the Huberman Lab podcast,
82.47 I offer mechanism upfront or first,
85.14 and then we talk about
protocols that you can use
88.2 that really lean on those science
89.82 and science based mechanisms.
91.83 Today I'm going to describe
a specific protocol
93.967 that serves as a general
template that anyone, in fact,
97.56 everyone can use in order to maximize all
100.248 aspects of fitness.
101.58 So that includes endurance,
strength, flexibility,
103.74 hypertrophy, aesthetic changes, et cetera.
107.1 However, this general
framework can also be modified,
110.64 that is customized to
your particular needs.
113.13 So if you're somebody
who really wants to build
114.48 more strength or bigger muscles,
116.31 you can change the
protocol and the overall
119.22 program according to that.
120.54 And I'll talk about very
specific ways to do that.
122.4 Or if you're somebody
who really just wants
123.84 to maintain strength, but
you want to build endurance,
126.18 we'll talk about that.
127.65 And of course, we will
cover real life issues,
130.35 such as should you train
if you are sleep deprived,
132.99 what about food?
134.01 When should you eat?
134.843 What if you haven't
eaten and you're hungry?
136.53 Should you still train?
Et cetera, et cetera.
138.536 We're going to cover all of that, again,
140.31 in the context of this,
141.512 what I would call foundational
template of fitness.
144.033 Now, this foundational template of fitness
146.37 is something that I personally use.
148.5 In fact, I've used it
for over three decades,
150.72 hard to believe that I'm that old,
151.86 but I just recently
turned 47, and I still use
154.38 this basic protocol or
template across the week
157.8 and modify it according to
what my particular goals
161.01 are that year, that month, even that day,
163.83 because I, like you,
live in the real world
166.02 and sometimes I've been traveling
or I miss a workout, yes,
169.92 it does happen, or life
isn't organized in exactly
172.723 the way that I need to in
order to have everything
175.326 go according to the
protocol that's on paper.
177.96 So we're going to
discuss real world issues
179.76 and how to work with the
real world issues in order
182.16 to get the most out of
your fitness program.
184.11 And again, by the end of today's
program, I can assure you,
186.87 you will have a template
protocol that you can build
190.62 up from, build out, change and modify,
193.32 and that will really serve
your fitness goals according
196.23 to the science and what
peer-reviewed studies
198.75 and the experts that
appeared on this podcast
200.82 and other podcasts really
tell us is best and optimal
204.06 for our fitness.
204.93 I'm pleased to announce that
the Huberman Lab podcast
206.91 has now launched a premium channel.
208.74 I want to be very clear that
the Huberman Lab podcast
210.99 will continue to be released
every Monday at zero cost
214.2 to consumer, and there will
be no change in the format
216.766 of these podcasts.
218.46 The premium channel is a
response to the many questions
220.98 we get about specific topics,
223.17 and it will allow me to really drill deep
225.18 into specific answers
related to those topics.
227.52 So once a month, I'm going
to host and ask me anything,
229.86 so-called AMA, where
you can ask me anything
232.56 about specific topics
covered on the Huberman Lab
234.48 podcast and I will answer those questions.
236.73 Those of course will be recorded.
238.02 They will also be other
premium content available
240.51 to premium subscribers such as transcripts
242.498 and short videos of new
tools and unique tools
245.153 for mental health, physical
health and performance.
248.64 If you want to check
out the premium channel,
250.2 you can go to hubermanlab.com/premium.
252.84 There is a $10 a month
charge or $100 per year,
255.36 and I should mention that a large portion
257.28 of the proceeds from the
Huberman Lab Premium Channel
259.53 will go to support scientific
research that develops
262.83 the very sorts of tools that we talk
265.11 about on the Huberman Lab podcast.
267.12 The rest of the support
268.08 for the Huberman Lab Podcast
premium channel will go
270.24 to supporting the regular
Huberman Lab podcast.
272.46 Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium.
275.19 Before we dive into today's
content about fitness
277.44 and fitness protocols, I want
to tell you about a brand
279.99 new study that is very exciting
and frankly very unusual.
284.88 This is a study that was published
286.47 out of the University
of Houston, examining
289.95 what I would call a micro
exercise or a micro movement.
293.207 It's a very small movement
of a very small portion
297.0 of your body, in fact, just
1% of your musculature,
300.018 that when it's performed
continuously while seated has,
304.35 at least what they
report, are very dramatic
306.157 positive changes in terms of blood sugar
308.927 utilization and metabolism.
311.79 So the title of this study
313.35 is "A potent physiological
method to magnify and sustain
317.19 soleus oxidative
metabolism improves glucose
320.55 and lipid regulation."
322.227 This study was published in iScience,
324.78 and as I mentioned earlier,
326.43 it is getting a lot of
attention and it's very unusual.
330.21 Without going into all
the details of this study,
332.55 let me just briefly give you a little bit
334.14 of the background.
334.973 First of all, you have a
muscle called the soleus.
337.195 The soleus muscle is a more
or less wide flat muscle
340.68 that sits beneath what most
people think of as their calf,
343.23 although it's part of the calf muscle.
344.91 The other portion of the calf
is called the gastrocnemius.
347.28 The soleus sits below that.
348.81 Now, the soleus muscle is a unique muscle
351.09 because it's largely slow
twitch muscle fibers.
354.36 It's designed to be used continuously
356.67 over and over again for
stabilizing your body
359.22 when you're standing upright, for walking.
362.16 This is a muscle that's
designed to contract
363.93 over and over and over again.
365.79 In fact, you could walk
all day on this muscle
368.25 and most likely it would not get sore.
371.04 You probably done that
and it did not get sore.
373.74 In contrast, a muscle like
your bicep or your tricep,
376.056 if I were to have you
perform hundreds or thousands
379.247 of repetitions, even
with a very lightweight
382.05 one pound weight or a two pound weight,
384.21 eventually it would fatigue.
386.19 You would feel a sort of a burn there.
387.99 It's a very unusual set of
muscles to use repeatedly.
390.9 But the soleus is an unusual
muscle in that it really
393.205 is designed to be used continuously.
395.58 Now, this study was focused
on how people who sit a lot
398.7 of the day and don't have
the opportunity for a lot
401.13 of physical movement or
maybe who don't even exercise
403.14 at all can improve their metabolism
406.134 and glucose utilization.
408.6 Without going into a deep dive
about glucose utilization,
411.6 because we've done the
deep dive on this podcast,
413.85 episodes such as metabolism, et cetera,
415.74 you can look those up at hubermanlab.com.
417.81 They're all timestamped
and available there.
419.94 Anytime you eat, your blood
sugar goes up to some extent.
422.88 So your blood glucose, as it's called,
424.32 goes up to some extent.
425.16 And then insulin is a hormone that's used
427.47 to essentially chaperone
and sequester and use
432.03 that blood glucose or
it's basically the idea
434.43 is you don't want blood
glucose to go too high.
436.23 Hyperinsulinemia is something associated
438.54 with blood glucose that's
too high because insulin goes
440.64 up to essentially match
the level of blood glucose.
442.74 You don't also don't
want to be hypoglycemic,
444.69 you don't want to have
blood sugar that's too low,
447.27 and insulin is involved
in both regulating peaks
450.87 and troughs in blood sugar, blood glucose.
453.87 So we can basically say,
and this is very simple,
456.33 but we can basically say
that you don't want blood
458.67 glucose to be elevated
too much or for too long.
461.55 That's not good.
462.6 In fact, people who have
diabetes because they don't
464.58 make insulin, people who
have type 1 diabetes do not
467.4 make insulin at all, their blood glucose
469.53 is so high that they
actually have to take insulin
472.32 in order to regulate otherwise
their blood glucose can
474.51 go so high that it can damage
cells and damage organs.
477.42 It can even kill people.
479.61 People who have type 2 diabetes are
481.5 so called insulin insensitive.
483.06 They make insulin, but the
receptors to insulin are
485.16 not sensitive to it,
486.21 and so they make more insulin
than normally would be
488.94 made and blood glucose
isn't regulated properly,
491.37 et cetera, et cetera.
492.72 The take home message about blood glucose
494.94 is that you want your blood
glucose levels to go up
496.92 when you eat, but not too
high and you don't want them
498.66 to stay elevated for too long.
500.94 This study looked at how
people who are largely
503.13 sedentary or at least sitting
can increase the utilization,
507.96 the clearance of glucose from
the bloodstream after eating,
511.68 and they also looked
at overall metabolism.
514.17 For people, get this,
515.73 that were using just that
1% of muscle, the soleus,
518.91 by doing what they call a soleus pushup.
521.49 So the soleus pushup can
be described very simply
523.62 as if you're sitting
down with your knee bent
526.11 at approximately right
angle, like a square corner,
530.1 and pushing up, or I should
say lifting your heel
533.13 while pushing down on
your toe and contracting
535.913 the calf muscle as it were,
538.277 and then lowering the
heel and then in lifting
541.615 that heel again, lowering the
heel, lifting the heel again,
544.185 each one of those is what
they call a soleus pushup.
547.856 This study had people
continuously do soleus pushups
552.48 and they looked at things like
blood glucose utilization,
556.05 they looked at metabolism and so on.
557.88 Now, a couple of important
things about this study
559.65 before I tell you what they discovered,
560.94 which was frankly pretty miraculous,
563.16 almost hard to believe,
565.17 and yet I believe the data
looked to be collected
568.622 quite well, and there
are a lot of statistics
571.32 and the study looks to be quite thorough.
573.51 First of all, they used
an equal number of male
575.01 and female subjects.
576.72 There were a wide range of
body mass indices, okay?
580.41 So this wasn't just super
fit people or people
582.48 that were purely sedentary and not fit.
584.34 They used a wide variety
of ages, time of day,
586.938 people who tended to walk
a lot or not walk a lot.
590.52 They measured changes
in metabolism and blood
593.19 glucose utilization and
people that had done
595.83 these soleus pushups while
seated in the laboratory,
598.59 and I must say,
599.423 they had them do these
soleus pushups for quite
600.87 a long while, continuously.
602.511 So they had them do it
for as long as 270 minutes
607.05 total throughout the day.
609.3 So if you divide that,
that's four and a half hours,
611.52 you might say, well,
612.353 four and a half hours of
lifting the heel and putting
613.95 the heel down, lifting the
heel, putting the heel down,
615.39 that's a lot.
616.223 But they didn't always do it continuously.
617.73 They had some breaks in there.
619.05 So this is the sort of
thing that you could imagine
621.254 you or other people could do while seated,
623.49 while doing Zooms or
while on calls or maybe
627.57 even while eating, doing
that sort of thing.
629.31 Although I'm not suggesting
that you constantly
631.26 be focusing on soleus
pushups throughout your life.
634.05 The point is that people
who did these soleus
636.75 pushups experienced dramatic
improvements in blood
640.89 sugar regulation and in
metabolism despite the fact
643.575 that the soleus is just 1%
of the total musculature.
647.04 So here I'm going to
read from the abstract
648.42 about what they found,
649.253 people who did these soleus pushups,
652.26 despite being a tiny muscle and using very
655.811 little local energy...
658.35 In fact, they measured muscle glycogen,
660.48 the burn or essentially
the utilization of fuel
663.54 within the muscle, and
there was very little
665.4 utilization of fuel
within the soleus itself,
668.43 and that's because the soleus
has this unique property
670.71 of needing to basically
keep you going all day,
673.23 walking all day or moving all day.
675.69 What they saw was a large
magnitude, for example,
679.77 52% less postprandial,
that's after a meal,
684.18 glucose excursion,
685.23 So 52% less increase in
blood glucose and 60%,
690.181 six zero less hyper insulinemia,
693.54 so reduced levels of insulin.
695.31 They also, miraculously,
observed that despite this being,
699.72 again, a small muscle, 1%
of the total muscle mass,
704.133 so very small oxidative use,
706.53 they saw big improvements in
systemic metabolic regulation.
710.46 So this is interesting
and I think something
713.04 that we should at least know about.
714.12 I'm not aware that anyone's
replicated this study yet.
716.52 I know there's a ton of
excitement about this study
718.5 in the popular press, and if
the data turn out to hold up,
722.16 which I like to imagine they will,
724.288 I can understand why
there's so much excitement.
726.42 What this means is that if
you're somebody who cares
728.46 about blood glucose regulation,
729.81 you want to keep your metabolism running,
732.12 please don't stop exercising,
733.53 the other ways that you exercise.
735.03 But if you're somebody who
wants to maximize your health,
738.54 doing these soleus pushups
fairly continuously
742.17 while seated is going to be beneficial.
744.87 And in addition to that,
745.92 I know that there are going
to be people out there who,
747.84 for instance, might be
injured or you're traveling
750.09 and you're stuck on a plane
or you're in the classroom
752.292 and you're forced to study
all day or take notes all day.
756.15 You're just not getting
enough opportunity to get
758.28 those steps that you want to take,
759.735 whether or that's 10,000 or fewer or more,
761.85 getting enough steps or movement.
763.44 Maybe you don't have time
to get out and do your run,
765.12 or maybe you're also running,
766.68 weightlifting and doing
yoga classes and things
769.11 of that sort, but you want to
further improve your fitness,
772.83 at least in terms of
your metabolic health.
774.93 This seems like a terrific,
776.37 very low investment way to do it.
778.2 Certainly zero cost.
779.67 It does take a little bit of attention,
781.23 so you have to divert
your attention from other
783.0 things you're doing to
make sure that you're still
784.44 doing these soleus pushups.
785.94 I'm sure that many of you
are going to have a lot
787.32 of detailed questions such
as how high did they lift
789.63 the heel and did they contract
the muscle very hard or not?
793.26 Couple of things about that,
794.1 they did not have subjects
really contract the muscle hard.
797.01 They did measure the angle of heel raise
799.65 and it was anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees
801.63 so they didn't have to go way,
way up on their tippy toes
803.85 or things of that sort.
805.38 In any event, 270 minutes,
807.96 four and a half hours of
doing these soleus pushups
810.564 is a lot, but by my read of the data
813.327 and the rather significant,
815.089 or I should say very significant effects
817.41 that they observed on
blood glucose regulation
819.18 and metabolism, et cetera,
821.04 seems to me that doing less
would still be beneficial
824.035 and that you don't necessarily
have to do the full
826.47 270 minutes in order to get the benefits
829.2 that they observed.
831.12 More about the study includes the fact
832.83 that the benefits they observed
were very long lasting,
835.35 as long as two hours after a meal,
837.09 they could still see this improved
838.32 blood glucose utilization.
839.7 I don't know because I wasn't able to find
841.56 it in the methods whether
or not they were doing
843.12 the soleus pushups while
they were consuming blood
846.66 sugar in this study.
849.18 The point being that if
you're somebody who cares
850.86 about their fitness, this
study is interesting,
853.35 because what it means is that, again,
855.12 if you are forced to be
immobile or sitting longer
857.55 than you would like,
858.9 if you're stuck in a meeting or Zooms
860.43 or class or on a plane, et cetera,
862.86 or if you're simply trying to add a bit
864.78 more fitness and metabolic
health to your overall regimen,
869.159 soleus pushups, at least to me,
871.32 seem like a very low investment, simple,
873.57 zero cost tool to improve
your metabolic health.
876.3 For those of you that
want to peruse the study
877.71 in more detail, we will provide a link
879.69 to this paper published in iScience
881.49 in the show note caption.
882.9 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
884.64 that this podcast is
separate from my teaching
886.53 and research roles at Stanford.
888.3 It is however, part of my
desire and effort to bring
890.79 zero cost to consumer
information about science
893.1 and science related tools
to the general public.
895.71 In keeping with that theme,
896.85 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
899.58 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
901.853 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
904.26 that analyzes data from
your blood and DNA to help
907.17 you better understand your
body and help you meet
909.09 your health goals.
910.05 Now, I've long been a
believer in getting regular
911.85 blood work done for the
simple reason that many
914.4 of the factors that impact your immediate
916.11 and long-term health can only be analyzed
918.3 from a quality blood test.
919.56 One issue with a lot of
blood tests and DNA tests
921.78 out there, however, is that
you get information back
923.85 about hormones, blood lipids, et cetera,
926.1 but you don't know what to
do with that information.
927.81 InsideTracker makes
understanding all of that very
929.79 easy and even better points
to specific directives,
933.21 that is things you can do
in terms of your lifestyle,
935.4 your nutrition,
supplementation, et cetera,
937.56 in order to bring those numbers related
939.39 to metabolic factors,
lipids, hormones, et cetera,
941.88 into the ranges that are optimal for you,
944.16 your immediate and long-term health.

956.94 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
959.4 ROKA makes eyeglasses
and sunglasses that are
961.65 the absolute highest quality.
963.48 The company was founded by
two all-American swimmers
965.46 from Stanford and everything
about ROKA eyeglasses
967.95 and sunglasses were designed
with performance in mind.
970.89 I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system,
972.69 and I can tell you that
your visual system has
974.13 to contend with an enormous
number of challenges
976.56 in order for you to be
able to see clearly.
978.3 ROKA understands this and has designed
979.92 their sunglasses and
eyeglasses to be worn in any
982.41 number of different conditions
and for you to still
984.27 be able to see with crystal clarity.
986.7 Now, I wear eyeglasses at night,
988.345 when I work or when I drive,
990.39 and I wear sunglasses during the day.
991.95 I don't wear sunglasses
when I get my morning
993.63 sunlight viewing, a
practice that I'm absolutely
995.88 religious about every single morning,
997.62 but throughout the day,
998.453 I'll wear sunglasses when
I drive or if I'm heading
1000.56 into bright sunlight to protect my eyes.
1002.81 ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses are terrific
1005.21 because they were
designed for performance,
1007.37 so they were designed for
things like cycling and running,
1010.37 so they won't slip off your
face if they get sweaty.
1012.26 They're extremely lightweight.
1013.28 In fact, most of the time
I can't even remember
1014.78 that they're on my face,
they're so lightweight.
1016.37 However, they also can be
worn anywhere, to work,
1018.86 to dinner, et cetera.
1019.91 They have a terrific aesthetics.
1020.99 Unlike a lot of other
performance eyeglasses
1022.67 out there that you can
only find in designs
1024.65 that really make people
look like a cyborg.
1026.131 ROKA makes the cyborg versions,
some people like those,
1028.55 but they also make versions
of their eyeglasses
1031.04 and sunglasses with frames that
you can wear out to dinner,
1033.455 to work, et cetera.
1034.815 If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses or sunglasses,
1037.31 go to roka.com.

1047.72 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.
1050.33 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
1051.913 that are customized to
your unique sleep needs.
1055.46 Now, sleep is the fundamental layer
1057.8 that is the most important
aspect of mental health,
1060.11 physical health and performance.
1061.31 I've said that before on this podcast,
1062.66 and I'm going to be saying
it over and over again.
1064.34 If you're sleeping well,
everything else is better,
1066.92 and if you're not sleeping well,
1068.0 everything else gets far worse.
1070.13 So sleep is vital,
1071.12 and sleeping on the correct
mattress is absolutely vital.
1073.85 Helix understands this,
and they have a brief quiz
1076.52 that you can take.
1077.353 So you simply go to their
website, you take this quiz,
1078.98 ask you questions such
as you tend to run hot
1081.38 or cold during the night, you
tend to sleep on your back,
1083.84 your side or your stomach,
or maybe you don't know,
1085.46 and they match you to
a mattress that's ideal
1088.01 for your particular sleep needs.
1089.42 For me, that was the
Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
1091.7 I've been sleeping on a
Dusk mattress for well
1094.04 over a year now, and it's
the best sleep I've ever had.
1096.35 If you like to try Helix Mattress,
1097.79 you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.
1100.88 Take that brief two minute
sleep quiz and they'll
1103.01 match you to a customized
mattress for your sleep needs.
1105.74 You'll get up to $200
off all mattress orders
1107.99 and two free pillows.
1109.25 Again, if you're interested,
1110.15 you go to helixsleep.com/huberman
1112.37 for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
1115.04 The Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered
1116.78 with Momentous Supplements.
1117.98 To find the supplements we discuss
1119.33 on the Huberman Lab podcast,
1120.56 you can go to live
Momentous spelled O-U-S,
1123.47 livemomentous.com/huberman,
1125.72 and I should just mention that the library
1127.13 of those supplements is
constantly expanding.
1129.32 Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
1132.38 Let's talk about fitness and let's talk
1134.36 about how you can develop
the optimal fitness
1136.34 protocols for you.
1137.5 So that includes what to
do each day of the week
1140.39 and your fitness protocol across the week,
1142.61 and indeed across the month and the year
1144.68 and even year to year.
1146.63 When we had Dr. Andy
Galpin on the podcast,
1149.12 he said something very
important that we want to keep
1151.16 in mind today, which is concepts
are few, methods are many,
1155.66 that is there are an
infinite number of different
1158.285 programs and exercises
and set and rep schemes
1161.3 and different runs and burpees
and pushups, et cetera,
1164.54 et cetera that one can follow.
1166.04 However, there are really
just a few basic concepts
1170.12 or principles of muscle physiology,
1172.875 of cardiovascular function,
of connective tissue
1175.88 function that provide or set the basis
1178.76 for the adaptations that we call fitness
1181.7 or that lead to fitness.
1183.17 So I'm going to list those off now.
1185.12 We can talk about a fitness
protocol that's really
1187.85 aimed mainly toward developing skill.
1190.61 That's one. Or speed.
1192.74 That's another.
1193.88 Or power, which is speed times strength,
1197.12 or specifically strength, or hypertrophy,
1200.72 growth of muscles, or endurance
such as muscular endurance.
1204.8 Muscular endurance is, for instance,
1206.48 your ability to stay in
a plank position or to do
1210.08 a wall sit, to sit on an
invisible chair against a wall,
1214.64 or other forms of endurance like near
1217.58 pure anaerobic endurance.
1219.02 So a one minute sprint or
less or a one minute all
1223.37 out cycling on stationary
bike, this sort of thing,
1227.0 or endurance that occurs
in the kind of 3 to 12
1230.69 minute total duration range.
1233.18 So that might be sprints or high intensity
1236.51 interval type training.
1237.83 It could be an all out swim,
it could be all out row.
1241.85 That's another form of endurance,
1243.08 taps into different fuel systems,
1244.85 different aspects of muscle
physiology, et cetera.
1247.727 And then endurance that
lasts 30 minutes or more,
1250.73 which is typically what people think
1252.05 about when they think about endurance.
1253.79 But of course, the other
forms of endurance matter.
1255.65 So we've got skill, speed,
power, strength, hypertrophy,
1259.07 muscular endurance, anaerobic endurance,
1263.33 what I would call 3 to
12 minute endurance,
1265.61 although it goes by other names as well,
1267.56 and 30 minutes or more endurance type
1269.641 exercise and adaptations.
1272.54 Each and every one of these
requires different principles,
1276.47 different concepts in order to improve,
1280.1 say your muscular strength
or your hypertrophy or both.
1283.34 However, there's a general
theme that sits beneath
1286.55 all adaptations leading to fitness,
1289.28 and that's what we're
really going to set down
1290.99 as the base layer,
1292.22 the foundation of everything
we talk about today.
1294.56 And that's that we need
to think about what are
1298.25 the modifiable variables?
1299.81 Again, I'm borrowing
directly from the episode
1302.03 with Dr. Andy Galpin.
1303.05 He was the one that said,
1303.883 modifiable variables are the
key thing to think about.
1306.32 What are you going to modify?
1307.55 What are you going to change
in order to increase one
1310.744 or some of the various things
I listed off before, skill,
1316.07 speed, power, strength,
hypertrophy, endurance,
1317.9 et cetera, et cetera.
1319.31 And some of the key concepts that emerge
1322.13 from that discussion are
that we need to think
1324.02 about progressive overload.
1325.46 Normally when people hear
about progressive overload,
1327.32 they think about adding more
weight to a bar or picking
1329.57 up heavier dumbbells,
but that could also be
1332.36 progressive overload in
the context of running up
1334.46 a hill of steeper incline
or running a little bit
1336.86 faster or a little bit further
and so on and so forth.
1339.508 Now, as I promised earlier,
1341.03 today we are not going to
drill into each and every one
1343.43 of the mechanisms that
underlie the different
1345.44 adaptations that are
going to develop speed
1348.17 and strength and endurance, et cetera,
1350.06 because that was covered in the podcast
1351.56 with Dr. Andy Galpin and the other podcast
1353.388 with experts that I mentioned earlier.
1355.37 And we again, will provide
links to those podcasts
1357.41 if you want to drill
into those mechanisms.
1359.75 Instead, what we are going
to do is we're going to start
1362.3 with a program that
essentially is designed
1365.9 for you to maximize all aspects of fitness
1369.74 to the extent that you can
simultaneously maximize
1372.8 all aspects of fitness,
1374.3 but then to change or modify that protocol
1377.96 so that if you want to
build up more, for instance,
1380.54 strength and you want to
just hold onto the endurance
1382.91 you have, you don't
want to build endurance,
1385.67 at least not in that week or
that month, you can do that.
1388.76 Or if you want to improve your endurance
1390.02 while maintaining your
strength, you can do that.
1392.75 And so on and so forth.
1394.73 Most people, I do believe,
1396.29 would like a combination
of strength and endurance
1399.86 and flexibility and
maybe even hypertrophy,
1402.5 particularly for certain
muscle groups that maybe are
1405.62 not as well developed
as other muscle groups.
1407.36 They want to bring
balance to their physique,
1409.1 both for sake of aesthetics
and for sake of health
1411.224 and for sake of general functioning,
1414.32 to maybe even to eliminate pain,
1416.39 the protocol that I'm going
to describe really works
1418.85 as a foundational
template for that as well.
1421.43 So let's drill into that
foundational protocol
1423.92 and I'll keep referring to it
as the foundational protocol,
1427.25 not because it's the one that I use,
1428.6 although it is the one that I use,
1429.797 and not because it's the
one that we're talking
1431.36 about today, although
it's the one we're talking
1432.89 about today, but because
we need some general
1434.93 framework from which to build out the more
1437.21 specific protocols that
we'll get into in a bit
1439.25 more detail later.
1440.72 So in this foundational
protocol for fitness,
1442.88 what you'll notice is
that on any one given day,
1446.24 you're going to focus on one
particular aspect of fitness.
1449.36 Maybe it's endurance, maybe it's strength,
1451.13 maybe it's hypertrophy, in particular,
1453.59 it might be hypertrophy for
a particular muscle group
1455.75 or muscle groups.
1457.43 That said, across the entire week,
1460.1 it's designed to bring
fitness and different forms
1462.89 of fitness to all aspects of your body.
1466.49 So this particular protocol begins
1468.704 on Sunday, although that's
simply the day that I happen
1472.55 to begin the protocol.
1473.72 And again, this protocol is not important
1476.12 because it's the one that I follow.
1477.301 I follow it because it is important.
1479.419 In other words, it's a
protocol that's really gleaned
1482.15 from the scientific
literature and the experts,
1483.991 that is for you.
1485.12 So this fitness protocol
is really about you.
1487.16 I just may refer to it as
the one that I follow simply
1490.1 for ease of communication.
1491.36 And for me, my week begins on Sunday.
1493.82 So I do my very best to
get a workout in on Sunday.
1498.08 And for me, that workout is
that of a endurance workout.
1502.28 It's designed to either maintain
or increase my endurance,
1507.5 and the endurance type that I'm referring
1509.6 to is endurance of 30 minutes or more.
1511.82 In fact, for me, the goal
is always to get either 60
1516.63 to 75 minutes of jogging.
1518.9 So this would be
so-called zone two cardio,
1521.69 people probably have
heard of zone two cardio,
1523.7 but if you haven't, that's okay.
1524.75 Zone two cardio is something
that you could measure
1527.36 with a heart rate monitor or other device,
1529.37 but you don't need to.
1531.05 Zone two cardio is the kind
of cardiovascular exercise
1533.591 in which you're pushing yourself to move
1537.874 such that you're breathing
faster than normal,
1541.4 your heart is beating
faster than normal, however,
1543.86 you are still able to
sustain a conversation.
1546.56 But if you were to push
yourself any harder,
1550.01 that is move faster or
go up a steeper incline
1552.89 at the same rate you happen
to be at any one moment,
1555.26 you would lose that ability to speak,
1557.66 you wouldn't be able
to complete sentences,
1559.04 you would be out of breath or you'd have
1560.36 to pause mid-sentence.
1561.83 Now, it's near impossible,
even with a heart rate monitor,
1564.62 to stay exactly in zone
two unless you're very,
1567.92 very skilled at that.
1568.76 So I don't obsess over that,
1570.35 and in fact I don't wear
a heart rate monitor
1572.0 when I do this exercise, but for me,
1573.585 the goal is to head out
on Sunday and get 60 to 75
1576.98 minutes of jogging in zone two.
1579.83 Now of course I like to jog,
1581.177 but that doesn't mean
that you have to jog.
1582.77 You could replace jogging with
rowing on a rowing machine
1587.0 or maybe even rowing an actual boat
1588.71 if you have access to that
or cycling or swimming,
1591.765 something that allows you
continuous movement for 60
1594.34 to 75 minutes at that zone two threshold
1598.67 we talked about earlier.
1600.68 For me, that can include some
hills, and when I say hills,
1603.92 they could be very steep hills,
1604.97 but I simply slow my pace
down in order to stay
1608.111 in that roughly zone two range.
1611.39 Or it could be that they
are more low grade hills
1615.14 and I might just slow down
a little bit or I might
1617.42 even push myself a tiny bit that day.
1619.46 But really I'm just trying
to build that long endurance.
1621.83 I'm trying to build up
my capacity or maintain
1623.84 my capacity to go a long
distance without fatiguing.
1627.5 Now some days, meaning
some Sundays, since I tend
1630.89 to do this almost always
1632.15 on Sunday, although there are exceptions,
1634.13 instead of doing the 60 to 75 minute jog,
1636.45 what I'll do is I will
head out for a long hike
1640.16 that could be two and a
half hours or three hours
1642.38 or maybe even a four or five hour hike.
1644.27 Sometimes it's very long.
1645.89 And I'll do that sometimes
simply to mix up the routine,
1650.63 because sometimes jogging
and jogging the same routes
1653.187 gets boring to me.
1654.71 I do enjoy running,
1656.0 that's something I've been
doing for a very long time,
1658.07 but sometimes it just
gets a little bit tedious
1661.94 and I want to do something different.
1663.238 Also, sometimes I want
to be social on Sundays.
1665.81 I want to head out on a hike
with my partner or I want
1668.93 to meet up with friends
and hike with them.
1670.82 And so taking a long hike
on Sunday is something
1673.01 that also could be quite social.
1674.36 And then I don't have to
worry about also getting
1676.25 in my workout when I'm
heading out on a hike
1678.77 with my partner or going
out to meet with friends
1681.391 or things of that sort.
1684.11 I will say that there's a specific tool
1687.47 or a specific change that
you can make to this Sunday
1690.453 long endurance, or at least
what I consider long for me,
1693.62 I mean it's by no means a marathon
1694.498 or an Ironman, but this
long endurance training,
1698.51 and that's the use of a weight vest.
1700.64 So something that I've
really started utilizing
1703.04 more recently, and by more recently,
1705.29 I really mean within the last year or so,
1707.45 is I purchased one of
these weight vests that can
1709.736 be anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds.
1713.06 What I use in the weight
vest is irrelevant.
1715.43 But it certainly changes
the level of effort required
1719.33 when taking a hike or even a walk.
1721.01 Now there's an additional
benefit of the weight vest,
1722.81 which is that if you
are going out for a hike
1725.66 or even for a walk for social reasons
1727.49 and you're with somebody that's not quite
1728.69 at the same fitness level that you are,
1730.7 frankly it's a little bit
rude to just keep walking
1733.152 ahead of them and running
back or running ahead
1735.29 and running back.
1736.31 Oftentimes you really want
to spend time with the person
1738.26 and you don't want them to feel
1739.28 as if they're holding you up.
1740.57 And so the weight vest
is a terrific way to get
1743.18 some additional work, then,
1744.86 as you'll find if you wear a weight vest,
1747.14 it is additional work
on, say, a shorter hike.
1750.5 So maybe the person
you're with only has time
1752.9 for an hour long hike,
1754.04 or maybe they just don't have
the fitness to do a two hour,
1757.01 three hour hike.
1757.94 So I'll throw on the
weight vest and I'll head
1759.92 out for a walk with them
or a hike with them,
1761.99 or sometimes I'll go out on a long hike
1763.67 with a weight vest myself.
1765.38 So again, the point of this, for me,
1767.87 Sunday, although it could fall
on any day for you, workout,
1770.72 is really to build up
that long form endurance.
1772.997 And this fits well
1773.96 with what Dr. Andy Galpin
and Dr. Peter Attia referred
1777.5 to as the real need to
get in some long endurance
1780.8 type work at some point
or even multiple points
1783.882 throughout the week.
1785.03 For me, this long Sunday
jog of 60 to 75 minutes
1788.482 or long Sunday hike or
weighted walk or weighted hike
1792.89 really accomplishes that goal.
1794.69 Sometimes leads to a
little bit of soreness,
1798.02 particularly in my
calves or if I'm wearing
1800.6 the weight vest, sometimes
my midsection will get
1803.84 sore because I'm trying to remain upright.
1805.82 So I think it also builds
up some muscular endurance,
1809.0 not just cardiovascular
endurance, but again,
1811.28 throughout the entire time
that I'm jogging or hiking,
1814.34 what I'm trying to get to
is a place where I can feel
1816.98 that my pulse rate is definitely elevated,
1819.62 but it's not so elevated
that I have to stop
1821.81 because I'm out of breath.
1823.16 And because I know some
people out there might be
1825.23 really neurotic about this sort of thing,
1827.09 if you have to stop because
you're out of breath,
1829.1 that doesn't mean that
you blew the workout,
1830.747 that you now aren't getting endurance.
1831.98 Of course, you're
getting benefits from it.
1834.35 So I'm not absolutely
neurotic about always
1836.48 staying exactly in that heart rate zone.
1838.73 I might stop and have a
conversation for a moment
1840.92 if it's a longer hike,
1842.09 although I really try
and keep moving and I try
1843.8 and push myself just a little bit further
1845.562 than where I'm exceedingly comfortable.
1848.69 And so for me,
1849.523 doing this long Sunday
hike or jog really provides
1853.366 a foundation, a base
for endurance that then
1856.49 the other endurance workouts
that I'll describe later,
1858.95 that take place later in
the week, can build on.
1861.77 Now, as I mentioned earlier,
1862.94 we will get back to the
mechanisms that this taps
1865.16 into and why this is so useful.
1867.62 There are multiple benefits
to doing these kinds
1869.66 of endurance type workouts
in zone two cardio.
1873.08 But by putting it at the
start of my week, again,
1876.05 my week starts on Sunday,
I'm sure that regardless
1879.303 of how the rest of the week goes,
1881.412 that I got my endurance training in,
1884.03 and of course I'm going to want to,
1886.25 and I will do endurance
training other days
1888.05 during the week, but if
something comes up or I happen
1890.18 to get sick or I'm really
behind in terms of work
1893.24 and I can't get other workouts
in, this Sunday long jog
1896.46 or hike really provides that fundamental,
1899.495 I can honestly say foundation,
1902.0 for cardiovascular fitness
and endurance that I can
1905.15 hang my hat on and say, okay,
I've got that one in the bag,
1907.85 and I can then look to other
days of the week to focus
1910.58 on other aspects of fitness.
1912.17 Now, a really important point to make
1913.85 about this Sunday endurance
workout is that allows
1917.21 you to check off a box and
that box is 75 or so minutes
1922.37 of zone two cardio, because
as you may have heard,
1926.33 either in this podcast or
from others out there like
1928.52 Dr. Peter Attia, getting
180 to 200 minutes
1931.516 of zone two cardio per week
has enormous positive effects
1936.23 on longevity and enormous positive effects
1938.34 on general health, again,
1941.27 in terms of cardiovascular function,
1942.8 but also metabolic fuel utilization,
1945.71 also in terms of your
musculature and your ability
1948.35 to use your body over
long distances for long
1950.96 periods of time.
1952.01 So while it doesn't complete
all 180 to 200 minutes
1956.12 per week, it certainly
gets you a good distance,
1959.15 pun intended, toward that goal.
1961.25 Now, I want to acknowledge
that some people might
1963.14 be starting a fitness program,
1964.73 and so 60 to 75 minutes of
jogging might be too long
1967.97 or a three hour weight vested hike,
1970.46 or some people might even
do what's called a ruck,
1972.44 like you wear a rucksack,
that might be too much,
1975.26 in which case certainly
start with less and go
1979.43 on flat ground and go
at the rate that allows
1981.44 you to get into zone two,
1982.605 but that is not excessively
difficult for you.
1984.83 And then as you build up fitness,
1986.0 you can add time or you can add weight
1988.43 through a weight vest,
1989.33 or if you don't want to
buy a weight vest or can't
1992.12 afford one, there's a
simple solution to that,
1994.353 I actually have a good
anecdote about that.
1996.53 One time I was heading out
for a hike with a friend
1999.17 of mine, he was a former
SEAL team operator,
2001.54 I'll never forget this,
and he said, oh yeah,
2003.167 "I'll bring you a sack."
2005.59 And I thought he meant like a sack lunch,
2006.97 like he was going to bring lunch.
2007.81 And I showed up and he
basically gave me a backpack
2009.52 that was loaded with a bunch of stuff
2010.93 and the backpack weighed about 40 pounds.
2012.58 And then we took a hike.
2013.6 So I was thinking lunch, he
was thinking weighted backpack,
2016.96 and weighted backpack or
even just any kind of strong
2019.87 sack that you can put over
your shoulders or even carry
2022.03 in your arms, it's going to
work exceedingly well to build
2025.0 in some extra requirement for effort.
2026.74 So you certainly don't have
to purchase a weight vest
2029.295 in order to get the benefits
of bringing additional
2032.87 weight along with you on these
long cardiovascular events.
2037.06 But again, build up over
time, you can add time,
2039.82 you can add weight,
2040.87 and that's also a really nice
feature of adding weight,
2042.88 which is at some point your
schedule might be such,
2045.989 or you just don't really
want to keep adding more
2050.35 and more and more time on
this long endurance Sunday,
2054.46 in this case, workout,
in that case add weight.
2058.42 You can also, as you build up fitness,
2059.86 you can add speed to it,
2060.91 your zone two and what
zone two is won't shift,
2064.03 but what work is required
from you in order to get
2066.85 into zone two will shift.
2068.44 That is as you get more and more fit,
2070.03 you'll have to move faster
and or bring more weight
2072.37 in order to stay in zone two
and that will simply tell
2075.19 you that you are indeed
improving your endurance.
2077.8 Okay, so then Monday
rolls around and I, like
2080.62 most everyone else out there,
2081.91 I work on Monday, I get
right into my emails
2085.81 and preparation for podcasts and running
2087.55 my laboratory, et cetera.
2089.05 However, I make sure that at some point
2092.05 on Monday, and for me that
some point is typically
2095.507 and ideally early in the
morning, so 7:00 AM or so,
2099.228 I train my legs on Monday,
so that includes quadriceps,
2102.64 hamstrings, and calves.
2104.26 Why do I do that workout on Monday?
2105.91 And what is that workout designed to do?
2107.41 Well, that workout is
really designed to make sure
2110.59 that I'm either maintaining
or building strength
2113.65 in my legs.
2115.18 And this is not simply
for aesthetic reasons.
2118.15 This is not simply to
grow bigger calves or grow
2120.7 bigger quadriceps and hamstrings,
2122.35 although it can accomplish
that as well depending
2124.72 on how you train.
2125.62 We'll talk about details of training.
2127.12 The reason for training legs
on Monday is several fold.
2129.22 First of all, they are
the largest muscle groups
2132.07 of the body, and by training your legs
2134.29 on Monday, it sets in
motion a large number
2137.11 of metabolic processes that
carry you some distance
2140.62 even through the whole week in terms
2141.88 of elevating metabolism,
in terms of amplifying
2145.42 certain hormonal events
in your body, et cetera,
2148.66 that are really beneficial.
2150.91 In addition to that,
2151.81 I'm of the belief that the
legs are the foundation
2154.24 of the body, and provided
you can train legs safely,
2157.751 that training legs is vitally important,
2160.15 not just for strength of the legs,
2162.49 but also for strength of your entire body.
2164.74 Again, some of that is
through systemic hormonal
2166.72 effects because if you're
going to train the large
2168.82 muscle groups of your body
under substantial loads,
2171.28 you will get systemic release of hormones,
2173.29 not just testosterone, although
certainly testosterone,
2175.75 but also things like growth hormone...
2177.528 You get increases in
all sorts of so-called
2179.804 anabolic hormones that
even if you're somebody
2182.38 who's not trying to increase muscle size,
2184.24 because I realize a lot
of people are not trying
2185.86 to do that, these are hormones that shift
2188.47 your metabolism and your
overall tendon strength
2191.32 and ligament strength
and overall musculature
2193.308 into what I would call
a strong foundation.
2196.96 So for me, Monday is leg workout.
2198.85 It also just feels good
to get the leg workout
2201.34 out of the way earlier in the week,
2203.26 and it accomplishes another goal,
2204.97 which is that I sometimes
will take one or two days off
2208.87 of a leg workout because
they can be very intense
2210.91 and they are large muscle groups,
2212.47 and I'll explain what
I do on the off days,
2214.24 they're not pure off days,
2215.47 they actually include some
recovery type training
2217.87 or even some all out training.
2220.0 But by training legs on
Monday, I'm able to get
2224.35 what I consider the hardest strength
2226.87 and hypertrophy workout
out of the way, and, again,
2230.02 set all those positive
physiological effects in motion
2232.48 for the entire week.
2233.86 The other thing is that no
workout exists in isolation.
2237.16 What you do one day is
going to be determined
2239.62 by what you did the previous day.
2241.0 And even though the previous
day I may have taken
2242.68 a three hour weight vested hike,
2244.69 never are my legs so
sore from that long slow
2247.207 endurance work, because
it is long and slow,
2250.45 that I'm unable to train legs.
2252.37 Contrast that with a, say,
2254.32 high intensity interval training workout,
2256.84 which comes later in the week,
and my legs might be sore.
2260.11 In fact, they might not
even be recovered such
2261.97 that I'm able to do a real legwork,
2264.34 I want to say a real workout.
2265.51 I'll describe what that means in a moment.
2267.34 So legs come on Monday, and I think
2268.873 that for those of you that
are using or interested
2271.87 in using resistance training,
2274.03 I suggest getting your leg
workout done early in the week.
2277.03 And for those of you that
have heard the phrase,
2279.48 don't skip leg day, I will
go a step further and say,
2282.94 don't skip leg day, in fact,
2284.53 make leg day your first day of strength
2286.51 and hypertrophy training.
2287.74 Put it on Monday.
2288.64 Okay, so now that we're talking
about resistance training,
2290.53 the question is going to
come up about sets and reps
2293.08 and all of that business.
2294.146 That was covered in a lot
of detail on the podcast
2297.13 with Dr. Andy Galpin, and
I'm going to get into some
2298.959 of that detail now,
2300.76 but I'm going to wait until
I describe the entire set
2306.04 of workouts for the week before
I go into even more detail,
2308.757 because there's a way of
what's called periodizing
2311.712 that is changing the
sets and reps, et cetera,
2314.511 across the week, and
indeed from month to month,
2318.34 that's really optimal.
2319.69 But I don't want to make it seem as if all
2322.18 of that just pertains to the leg workout.
2324.49 It actually pertains to all
of the resistance training.
2327.22 So I'll just give you a couple of teasers
2329.428 about the key principles
of resistance training
2332.21 that I think are almost
universally, if not universally,
2336.88 then generally accepted
in the strength training
2339.79 and physiology community.
2341.44 And then later I'll get back to some
2343.84 of the overarching
principles that apply to all
2347.068 strength and hypertrophy
workouts across the week,
2350.83 including the ones for the
torso, the arms, et cetera.
2353.26 Okay, so legs fall on Monday, I should say
2356.2 that leg workouts, like all
resistance training workouts,
2359.89 for me, consist of about, again,
2363.19 I'm not neurotically attached to this,
2364.57 but about 10 minutes of
warming up and then about 50,
2367.98 five zero, to 60 minutes of real work.
2370.99 Now, of course, some of that is
going to be rest between sets,
2373.36 but by real work, I mean really hard work,
2375.94 not necessarily to failure,
2377.41 we'll talk about failure in a little bit,
2378.88 but hard work where I'm
struggling to complete
2382.053 the final repetitions,
if not going to failure
2385.15 to continue to move
the weight repetitions.
2388.03 And again, the entire work
portion of that workout
2391.21 is about 50 to 60 minutes.
2393.22 Why?
2394.053 Well, past 60 minutes,
2395.17 you start getting increases in cortisol
2396.82 that really impede recovery.
2398.05 And I personally am somebody
that does not recover
2402.1 very well from high intensity exercise.
2404.62 I realize that within the
literature, it is believed,
2409.24 and I think generally accepted,
2410.92 that when you stimulate muscle hypertrophy
2414.01 or strength increases, it
impacts the nervous system,
2418.055 it also causes things like
protein synthesis, et cetera.
2420.33 There are a number of
different forms of adaptation
2422.98 that occur to give you muscle
strength and size changes.
2427.15 And these days people
talk a lot about needing
2429.61 to stimulate muscle
growth or muscle strength
2432.07 at least every 48 hours.
2433.93 But I can tell you that I
recover route there slowly,
2436.6 and I benefit from working
the same muscle group
2439.66 about twice per week, with longer,
2442.93 or I should say more days of rest
2445.63 in between those workouts.
2447.13 So if I train legs on
Monday, believe it or not,
2449.89 I'm only training legs on Monday.
2452.08 I do not have a second leg
workout during the week.
2455.08 However, on Friday, I do a high intensity
2459.1 interval training session
that serves two purposes.
2462.4 One is it serves the purpose
of triggering a certain
2465.37 type of endurance and
getting my heart rate
2467.881 very, very high.
2469.54 And in addition to that,
2470.68 because of the way I do that workout,
2472.84 it acts as a sort of supplement or a more
2475.57 moderate intensity workout
for quadriceps, hamstrings,
2480.4 and calves, such that I at
least never lose strength,
2483.97 and in fact, generally
build strength from one leg
2486.43 workout to the next, provided
I'm doing things correctly.
2489.76 So what I'm not referring
to is the kind of classic
2493.72 super high intensity training
once per week and then
2496.253 not actually training
that muscle group again.
2498.79 For me, it's really training
each muscle group twice
2501.13 per week, once directly
and then once indirectly,
2504.94 either during another
weight training workout
2507.04 or during a cardiovascular,
2509.17 I should say endurance training workout.
2510.61 So again, legs on Monday, the
workout is 50 to 60 minutes,
2514.0 after a brief warmup.
2515.83 I generally pick two
exercises per muscle group.
2518.95 So again, I'm doing calves,
I'm doing quadriceps,
2521.89 and I'm doing hamstrings.
2523.33 You should pick the
exercises that work for you.
2526.36 So that's why I'm actually
not going to share
2527.92 which exercises I use.
2529.06 I'll give you a couple suggestions
about the ones I do use,
2531.7 but really, exercise selection,
2533.38 as Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
2534.78 is a very important variable.
2537.052 And the key thing to
emphasize for that variable
2539.62 is that you need to be able to
perform the movement safely.
2542.26 So I know there's a huge debate out there,
2544.21 and people love to argue
about whether or not one
2546.16 can squat or deadlift
for long periods of time,
2548.8 or should or should not.
2549.94 Some people say you absolutely should.
2551.59 I personally do not squat
and do not deadlift.
2554.89 I've actually never done much
squatting or deadlifting,
2557.53 and I know some people
out there are probably
2559.54 rolling their eyes or switching
the channel at this point.
2563.29 But I can say that for me,
2565.87 I've been able to achieve the strength
2568.42 and hypertrophy goals
that I've been seeking,
2570.973 doing things like leg
extensions and hack squats
2574.69 or for hamstrings, doing
things like leg curls
2576.61 and glute-ham raises or
for calves doing standing
2578.89 and seated calf raises and so on.
2580.99 I think a key principle
that everyone should pay
2583.18 attention to is one that was taught to me
2585.4 by an excellent strength coach years ago,
2588.88 and I still use this and
at least it works for me.
2591.43 For each muscle group,
2592.81 try and find an exercise in
which you get that muscle
2596.2 into a weighted stretch position.
2598.51 So this would be, for instance,
the standing calf raise,
2600.97 down at the bottom,
2601.803 it's weighted and you're
in a deep stretch provided
2604.36 you're doing the movement correctly.
2606.64 As well as another exercise
2608.673 where you're getting
contraction in the shortened
2611.56 position of the muscle.
2612.58 So for the hamstrings,
that would be the leg curl,
2614.68 for the calves, it would
be a seated calf raise,
2617.5 for the quadriceps, the leg extension is,
2622.03 if the machine is designed
right and you're doing
2623.98 it correctly, the peak
contraction is largely going
2625.902 to occur at the legs extended position,
2629.14 but then another exercise
for each muscle group
2631.529 that puts the muscle
into more of a stretched
2634.201 or at least a larger range
of motion or compound
2638.752 type movement,
2639.7 but ideally where there's
some stretch there.
2641.65 So I guess I will tell
you what exercise I do,
2644.35 for the quadriceps is
going to be leg extensions
2646.18 and hack squats.
2647.013 I use hack squats because
I don't do free bar squats
2649.36 for safety reasons, and I
like the hack squat machine.
2651.85 I'll do leg curls and glute-ham
raises for hamstrings,
2655.87 and I'll do standing calf
raises and seated calf
2657.94 raises for the calves.
2658.773 Again, those are the movements that I use
2660.55 because I can perform them
safely in the repetition
2663.31 ranges and with the weights
that are required for me
2665.77 to either maintain or build
leg strength and calf strength.
2668.86 But you might decide that
for you, dead lifts are
2671.59 absolutely essential and terrific,
2673.33 or squats free bar squats
are absolutely terrific
2676.51 or front squats.
2677.95 I'm not here to tell you which
exercises to do or not do.
2681.37 I am telling you that it's probably wise
2684.19 to at least consider doing
at least two exercises
2688.81 per muscle group, probably three maximum,
2691.57 if you ask me if you're
doing your entire legs
2693.49 and calves in one day.
2694.6 But to think about doing one exercise
2696.34 where the muscle's brought
into that shortened
2698.05 peak contraction position,
2699.64 like leg curls or leg
extensions or seated calf raise,
2701.83 and then another exercise
for each muscle group
2704.05 where there's more of
a elongation and maybe
2706.09 even a stretch on the muscle group.
2708.01 In fact, that's a principle
that you'll hear me talk
2709.93 about later when I talk
about training other muscle
2712.6 groups for strength and hypertrophy.
2714.43 So now you know approximately
how long to train,
2717.37 you might be somebody who
can get away with training
2719.29 for an hour and a half,
2720.85 and that won't impede your recovery.
2722.65 For me, that really starts
to impede my recovery.
2724.555 Also, if I'm staying on task,
2726.861 that 60 minute limit
really works well for me.
2729.97 Do I occasionally train for 75 minutes?
2732.94 Yes, because if I'm waiting
for a piece of equipment,
2735.07 sometimes I have to just wait longer.
2737.08 So that happens.
2737.913 But I really try and
keep the total duration
2739.87 of the workout shorter.
2741.64 How many sets and reps and rest intervals?
2743.47 Well, that was covered by
Dr. Andy Galpin as well.
2745.84 Without getting into the total science,
2747.79 here's a brief summary
of how to structure that.
2752.44 It's pretty clear that
if you're going to do
2755.95 lower repetitions and heavier weight,
2760.3 that you're going to want
to do a bit more volume.
2763.45 I know that this spits
in the face of what a lot
2765.61 of people think, but so if
you're going to do five sets
2768.31 of five, and I would
consider five repetitions
2770.029 low repetition range, heavier weight,
2774.13 and if you're going to train
with higher repetitions,
2776.41 you can do fewer sets.
2777.61 That certainly works for me.
2780.73 I generally follow a program
where for about a month,
2783.85 so three to four weeks,
2785.38 I will do all my resistance training
2787.51 in the repetition range of
about four to eight repetitions.
2791.71 So that's rather heavy. A few more sets.
2794.83 So it might be anywhere from three to four
2797.71 sets per exercise.
2799.84 Again, still just two exercises.
2801.43 And longer rest between sets,
2803.41 anywhere from two minutes
to maybe even four minutes
2806.62 if it's really heavy leg work.
2808.72 And then for the next month,
2810.46 switch to repetition range
that's closer to 8 to 12,
2815.05 maybe even 15 repetitions per set,
2817.69 but do fewer sets overall,
2819.91 so maybe just two to
three sets per exercise.
2821.98 Again, just two exercises
per muscle group typically.
2825.28 And shorten the rest between
sets so that it's more
2829.42 in the 90 second,
2830.59 maybe even as short as 60
second rest between sets,
2833.29 but typically 90 seconds
to about two minutes or two
2836.17 and a half minutes.
2837.003 So basically it's one month heavier,
2838.734 the next month, slightly lighter,
2841.06 although I wouldn't say lighter,
2842.26 I would say moderate weight
and moderate rep range.
2846.1 That tends to work well for me.
2848.11 It also adheres to a
principal that came up
2851.05 during the discussion, again,
2852.31 with Dr. Andy Galpin,
that for hypertrophy,
2854.59 you really can use
repetition ranges anywhere
2856.51 from 5 to 30, three zero, reps.
2859.81 But he emphasized changing
the repetition ranges
2862.93 in order to offset boredom.
2864.85 Frankly, I like to train heavier.
2866.53 I enjoy training in the
four to eight rep range.
2868.57 However, I notice that
if I do that for more
2870.76 than four weeks in a
row and I don't switch
2872.62 over to training in the
8 to 12, maybe in 15
2875.62 repetition range for about a month,
2877.39 well then I can't make
continuous progress.
2879.28 I start to actually lose ground.
2880.96 But by switching back and forth,
2883.15 I actually can make
continuous progress at least
2886.12 across the year.
2887.56 So I hope that that principle,
2889.48 or I should say that protocol
was communicated clearly.
2893.565 It works very well, I assure you.
2895.18 Does that mean that I
never get 10 repetitions
2897.91 on a week when I'm supposed
to train in the four
2900.49 to eight repetition range?
2901.54 No.
2902.574 Occasionally I'll venture up
into the 10 repetition range,
2904.93 but I really try and cluster
the low repetition work
2908.23 for about a month, again,
2909.55 across all workouts and all exercises
2911.53 and the slightly higher,
2913.12 I would even say moderate
repetition work across
2915.49 to the next month.
2916.63 One thing that you'll
notice since we are talking
2918.52 about total fitness programming
2920.2 is that during the months
where you are doing
2923.95 moderate repetitions, you'll notice
2925.54 that your endurance work
will actually be facilitated.
2929.98 And I do not think that's a coincidence.
2932.14 In fact, it's not a coincidence.
2933.49 It's because when you
are training very heavy
2935.543 or in the heavier range,
lower repetitions, et cetera,
2939.22 you're tapping into different
processes in those muscles.
2941.56 So when you head out for
that long Sunday hike,
2943.42 or as you'll soon hear,
2945.22 whereas on Friday you're
going to do high intensity
2947.17 interval training, what you'll notice
2949.09 is during certain months
of weight training,
2951.49 when you're training more
heavy, those workouts will feel,
2955.24 literally will feel
different than they will
2957.7 during the months when you're doing
2958.66 moderate repetition work.
2961.3 I am not a competitive athlete.
2963.22 I'm not running races
or triathlons like some
2965.47 of my friends.
2966.46 I'm very impressed by them.
2967.69 I'm really just trying to get overall
2969.61 cardiovascular fitness, overall strength,
2972.07 overall hypertrophy where I
need it, maintain muscle size,
2975.409 et cetera,
2976.51 in muscle groups where I'm
just trying to maintain.
2978.37 That's really my goal.
2979.84 So I'm not trying to optimize
any of these workouts
2982.66 for any one performance
feature, but in a little bit,
2985.6 we'll talk about how you
can change various aspects,
2990.16 that is, variables of these
protocols, in order to say,
2992.26 for instance, really emphasize hypertrophy
2994.57 or really emphasize endurance.
2996.7 Okay, so with what I would call a standard
2998.56 endurance workout done
on Sunday, and I say
3000.57 standard because most people,
when they hear endurance,
3002.52 they think of the ability to endure,
3004.26 to continue in a repeated
movement or exercise
3007.92 over some period of time,
3009.12 with that workout done on Sunday, and then
3011.28 with the leg workout done
on Monday, you can feel
3014.22 really good about how you're
heading into the week.
3016.41 However, after training
legs on Monday, I experience
3020.279 that doing cardiovascular
workouts the next day
3023.737 is either inefficient or at
least doesn't really allow
3028.5 me to completely recover
from my leg workout.
3030.72 Now, I realize that
some people are going to
3031.95 immediately scoff at that, and in fact,
3034.8 there are really beautiful
papers out there talking
3037.26 about how one can
actually do a fair amount
3040.41 of cardiovascular exercise
without interfering
3042.718 with their strength and
speed and hypertrophy
3045.96 improvements and vice versa.
3049.2 In fact, there's a terrific
review that was mentioned
3051.281 on the podcast with Dr. Andy Galpin.
3053.7 This is a review that we'll
provide a citation to,
3056.847 and a reference and a link to,
3058.83 which is the review by Murach
and Bagley, which talks
3062.01 about whether or not there's interference
3063.69 between strength and endurance workouts.
3065.52 Really interesting review
if you want to peruse that.
3068.49 But with all that said,
3069.9 I like to take Tuesday as a no endurance,
3072.72 no resistance training day,
3075.21 but that doesn't mean that
I'm not doing anything
3077.64 for my overall health and fitness.
3080.28 On Tuesdays, I do a series
of heat cold contrast.
3085.56 In other words, I get really,
3087.42 really warm and then I
get really, really cold,
3089.46 I get really, really
warm and I get really,
3090.81 really cold repeatedly.
3092.43 And the way I do that is by
getting into a hot sauna.
3096.3 So for me, that's really hot,
3097.74 but I've built up my heat conditioning,
3099.3 so please don't do this
unless you've built up
3101.04 your ability to withstand heat.
3103.38 And I'll get in for about 20 minutes.
3105.84 Sometimes 15, but usually 20 minutes.
3107.97 Then I get out and then I
will get into an ice bath
3110.76 or a cold water bath
3112.62 that's about 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
3116.37 Again, don't get into water that's so cold
3119.34 that you go into shock.
3120.63 I'll explain what a good
cold stimulus could be
3124.65 for you and how to determine that.
3125.982 Or if I don't have access
to my sauna and my ice bath,
3130.98 what I can do if I'm
traveling is I will take a hot
3133.86 bath and then alternate with cold shower,
3135.87 hot bath, cold shower.
3137.61 It's hard to do hot bath ice bath
3139.71 unless you have two baths.
3140.67 I don't know any hotel rooms,
3141.81 at least I've never stayed
in one that has two baths,
3143.43 although I'm sure they're out there.
3145.08 But for me, this is heat cold contrast.
3148.466 And really what this day
is about is two things.
3151.59 First of all, I'm trying
to accelerate recovery
3154.05 from the leg workout I did previously.
3156.18 Also, if you listen to our episode
3158.534 of the Huberman Lab podcast
about deliberate heat
3161.16 exposure or you listen to our episode
3162.87 of the Huberman Lab podcast
about deliberate cold exposure,
3166.62 I talk about some of the
benefits of heat and cold,
3169.62 and I get into a lot of details
3171.48 about how you can access heat.
3172.617 You can do baths, you can do saunas,
3174.6 you can even take hot showers.
3176.16 If you don't have access to any of that,
3177.51 you could even wrap your
body from the neck down
3179.91 in a garbage bag, plastic
garbage bags, believe it or not,
3182.61 wrestlers used to do this,
3183.51 put on some sweats and go running.
3185.04 That'll get you warm.
3186.0 Again, be careful not to
overheat and then you can
3188.623 get into a cold shower.
3190.14 So there's a lot of ways,
3191.19 depending on your budget
and what you have access to.
3193.558 I don't use cryo, these
cryotherapy chambers,
3196.56 they're hard to find.
3197.393 They're expensive.
3198.33 Again, I use sauna and
ice bath and I will do
3201.119 anywhere from three to five
rounds, which is a lot,
3204.3 anywhere from three to five rounds of heat
3206.49 for about 20 minutes and
cold for about 5 minutes.
3209.79 How cold should the cold be?
3211.29 We covered this in the episode
on deliberate cold exposure.
3214.23 Here's a general rule of thumb.
3215.79 It should be cold enough that
you really want to get out,
3219.69 but not so cold that it's unsafe.
3221.88 And that will vary from person to person.
3223.68 So I cannot give you a
simple prescriptive there.
3226.26 Same thing with the heat,
3227.31 hot enough that you're
sweating and that you want
3229.38 to get out, but not so hot
that you're running the risk
3231.87 of injuring yourself or killing yourself.
3234.51 And again, that will vary
from person to person.
3236.34 So you have to build up slowly,
3237.57 be careful and build up empirically.
3240.03 I do that on Tuesdays again as a way
3241.86 to accelerate recovery and
because it's very clear
3243.778 that there are cardiovascular benefits,
3245.79 maybe even benefits for the brain related
3249.42 to the cardiovascular
benefits because of course
3251.34 the brain needs a lot of
blood flow and needs a lot
3254.04 of nutrients and other things flowing
3255.761 into and out of there,
3257.61 debris out and nutrients and
other things into the brain.
3262.38 Heat can help accelerate
that or improve that.
3265.11 And so I'm doing that to
improve cardiovascular function,
3267.18 improve brain health, and
then the cold contrast
3271.44 provides a sort of accelerator
on that or an amplifier
3274.35 I think is the better way to phrase it
3275.85 on that process because in the cold
3277.53 you get vasoconstriction
and then in the heat
3279.69 you get vasodilation.
3280.523 And so you're maximizing that process,
3282.33 which is actually a neural process.
3284.82 Nerves actually innervate
the blood vessels
3286.47 and capillaries and even the arteries
3288.93 in order to allow that
constriction and dilation
3290.97 process to occur.
3292.44 So Tuesday is really about recovery,
3294.2 but my recovery day isn't necessarily
3296.849 about just laying around
and not doing anything.
3300.21 I might still also take
some walks that day.
3302.31 Remember, I want to try
and get that 200 minutes
3304.2 of zone two cardio across the week,
3306.03 and sometimes, not often,
3308.31 but sometimes I'll get
in a few minutes or more
3310.95 of walking quickly that day.
3312.66 But generally I'm working
a lot on Tuesday as I do
3315.06 on Monday, and I'm a
little bit tired and maybe
3317.58 even a little bit sore from my leg workout
3319.65 the previous day Monday.
3320.73 So I try and get that hot cold contrast.
3323.22 There are other benefits
to hot and cold contrast.
3325.412 We have a description of
the different protocols
3328.95 for hot and for cold and their contrast
3331.65 at our Huberman Lab newsletter.
3333.15 You can find that by
going to hubermanlab.com.
3335.25 Go to the newsletter tab under the menu
3337.05 and you can sign up.
3338.176 You can actually download
those protocols very
3339.42 easily without even signing
up if you just want to
3341.792 access them straight off.
3343.451 So Tuesday is really about
recovery and about getting
3345.54 some additional cardiovascular benefits
3347.76 from heat cold contrast.
3349.14 One other thing that's
built into the rationale
3350.793 for doing a lot of heat and
cold on one day as opposed
3353.94 to doing it every day...
3355.08 Well, in addition to it
being a little bit more
3356.64 convenient because certainly
some people don't access
3358.794 to heat and cold sauna and
cold dunks et cetera every day.
3363.6 So maybe getting to do
that one day is more
3366.03 accessible or feasible.
3367.56 But in addition to that,
3368.61 it's very clear that
while there are benefits
3372.12 to doing sauna often,
3374.1 and we talked about this
in the deliberate heat
3375.54 episode and the episode
3377.04 with Dr. Rhonda Patrick
when she was a guest
3378.72 on this podcast, it's
also clear that if you do
3382.23 sauna seldom, that is once a week,
3384.72 but you do a lot of it on
one day, so in this case,
3387.51 it's an hour, if it's,
remember, it's one more,
3390.57 it's three to five rounds
of 20 minutes of sauna
3392.76 followed by about 5 minutes of cold or so,
3396.03 by doing that all on one day,
3397.799 the peer reviewed research that's covered
3399.87 in the episode on deliberate heat,
3402.12 this is a study out of Finland,
3403.74 showed that you get massive,
3405.27 even 16 fold increases in growth hormone,
3407.61 which are extremely
beneficial for metabolism
3409.65 and for recovery.
3411.0 So these massive increases
in growth hormone are seen
3413.49 when you are doing these sessions of sauna
3415.689 that are repeated on the
same day and you're only
3419.04 doing that about once a week.
3420.24 Whereas if you do sauna more often,
3421.86 there are certainly benefits to that,
3423.66 but it's time consuming and
you need access to sauna
3427.088 more often than one day
a week if you're doing
3428.97 it more than one day a week.
3430.32 But if you do it one day a
week and you're doing a lot
3432.09 of sessions within that
day, as I've detailed here,
3435.519 you see these massive
increases in growth hormone
3437.805 that are not observed if
you're doing sauna more often
3440.94 for the other benefits of sauna.
3442.86 Now the effects of cold are many,
3444.6 it's not just vasoconstriction,
3446.73 but the effects of cold
are also counterbalanced
3449.73 by some of the problems with
deliberate cold exposure
3452.91 that maybe you've heard about
on this podcast and a lot
3455.52 of other podcasts and seem
to be a kind of a buzz theme
3459.716 on Twitter and elsewhere.
3461.73 And the point is this,
3462.63 there are a number of
quality studies showing
3464.7 that if you do deliberate cold exposure,
3466.62 in particular ice baths
or getting into very cold
3468.87 water immediately after an
endurance training session
3473.13 or a strength and hypertrophy
session, it can indeed, yes,
3478.17 it can disrupt or prevent
some of the adaptations
3481.632 that you are seeking with
strength and hypertrophy
3484.53 and endurance workouts.
3486.21 Okay, so you heard that right.
3487.86 And I believe that to be
true based on now several
3491.79 quality peer-reviewed studies.
3493.32 So by doing your deliberate cold exposure
3494.85 on Tuesday, you're not
going to get those effects,
3497.784 that is the blocking of
hypertrophy or the blocking
3501.926 of strength improvement or
the blocking or prevention
3505.11 of improvements in
endurance that would occur
3507.12 if you immediately got into the ice bath
3508.699 after a hypertrophy strength
or endurance workout.
3512.34 Now the caveat to that is if
you are somebody who likes
3515.55 to do cold showers,
3516.581 I am not aware of any
data that says that cold
3520.41 showers cannot be
performed after a strength
3523.29 hypertrophy or endurance workout.
3525.75 Cold showers are different
than submersion up
3529.29 to the neck in an ice
bath or another cold body
3532.29 of water for a number
of different reasons.
3534.09 In fact, they tap into different aspects
3536.91 of the nervous system entirely.
3538.26 We don't have time to go into that now,
3539.46 it's covered in the episode
on deliberate cold exposure,
3541.98 but the simple point is by doing your heat
3544.83 and cold contrast, or hey, listen,
3547.56 if you're somebody who
doesn't have access to sauna
3549.12 or you don't like hot
baths and you just do
3550.62 some deliberate cold
exposure on Tuesday, you are
3554.07 doing that separate from
your strength and hypertrophy
3555.837 and endurance workouts such
that it will not impede
3558.896 the benefits of those workouts.
3561.21 Okay, so long endurance on
Sunday, leg resistance training
3564.6 on Monday and on Tuesday,
heat cold contrast.
3568.23 That brings us to Wednesday.
3569.85 And on Wednesday we get back
3572.16 to a resistance training workout.
3574.62 And the resistance training
workout that I emphasize
3577.98 on Wednesday is one in
which you train your torso.
3581.46 Yes, literally your torso.
3582.66 I know this is counter to
this so-called bro science
3585.69 of bro splits.
3586.62 I don't know who originated that term,
3588.24 it's a terrible term.
3589.26 It essentially alienates
anyone who's not a bro
3593.28 or considers themselves a bro.
3595.17 But in any case,
3596.55 this is not about training
chest or back or shoulders.
3599.67 In fact, it's really about
strengthening the muscles
3602.91 of the torso and of
course includes the chest
3605.73 and the shoulders and the back.
3607.29 And I'm sure, as I say this,
3608.73 a number of people out
there who are obsessed
3610.23 with hypertrophy and
muscle growth and filling
3612.27 out their shirts or whatever
it may be, are thinking,
3615.09 oh no, this is just kind
of all around fitness.
3617.85 But no, the point is,
3619.62 on Wednesday you train your
torso and that's going to
3623.7 involve some pushing, so that's,
3625.248 for you that might include
some training of things
3629.04 like bench presses or
incline presses as well
3631.08 as shoulder presses or lateral raises,
3633.18 things for the shoulders
as well as for the back,
3634.89 some pulling exercises.
3636.24 These could be bent over
rows or chin-ups or pull-ups.
3638.61 Again, there are enormous
number of exercise for each
3641.91 and every one of these muscle groups.
3643.35 Now, I believe there's a
clear benefit to training
3645.9 all these muscle groups
together on the same day,
3649.02 because much in the same
way that training legs all
3651.07 on one day can lead to
these systemic effects
3653.7 because they're large muscle groups,
3655.29 working both the pushing
muscles and the pulling
3656.88 muscles of the torso on one day,
3658.68 at least in the context of this program,
3660.21 is very time efficient,
and tends to wick out
3663.81 into a number of different dimensions
3665.37 of health that at least I'm
interested in and I think
3667.8 a lot of other people are interested in.
3669.03 What are those?
3669.863 Well, let's think again,
3670.696 I want to be strong in not just
my legs, but my upper body.
3674.04 I also may want, may want
to engage some hypertrophy,
3678.6 to grow certain muscle
groups in order to create
3680.91 a sense of balance.
3681.743 I could be for aesthetic reasons,
3682.71 but also for balancing
strength and for health of,
3684.81 and the integrity of
the joints, et cetera.
3687.0 And in addition to that,
3688.62 by training a bunch of different
muscle groups together,
3691.38 you have the opportunity
to get the more systemic
3693.93 hormonal effects and
metabolic effects that occur
3697.8 when you're not just
training one muscle group
3699.57 and isolating that one muscle group,
3700.95 but rather training a bunch
of muscle groups together.
3703.65 So Wednesday I train torso
and I do that in push
3706.05 pull fashion just for
kind of time efficiency.
3710.07 Sometimes that means doing
a pushing exercise and then
3712.44 a pulling exercise.
3713.305 Sometimes it might even
mean doing a set of pushing
3715.581 and then a set of pulling
and going back and forth.
3717.72 However, if you're in a gym,
3719.37 in particular, a crowded gym,
3721.32 please don't be one of those people
3722.4 that colonizes multiple
pieces of equipment and says,
3724.95 I'm working there, I'm working there,
3726.3 and that can be quite a
dance and it can be hard
3728.25 to orchestrate a workout like that.
3730.11 So sometimes it will be
starting off with a set
3732.75 of shoulder presses and
then doing all your sets
3735.391 of those and then moving
to your chin ups and then
3738.39 moving perhaps back to
shoulders and realizing, ah, oh,
3741.63 someone's on the machine that I wanted,
3743.13 or using the equipment that I wanted,
3744.45 so I'll just finish up the pulling,
3745.77 I'll finish up the back work
and then go in to the push.
3747.93 I don't obsess over the
alternation in any kind
3750.69 of strict way.
3751.62 I really just try and get the
muscles of the torso trained.
3753.96 And again, it's two
exercises per muscle group.
3756.39 And one of those exercises
is going to be something
3759.0 where there's, I realize this isn't
3760.929 physiologically accurate, but a shortening
3763.47 of the muscle or where they,
at the end of the movement,
3766.616 the muscle is under maximal contraction.
3770.07 I could throw out some names of exercises
3771.75 just for purpose of understanding.
3773.52 So this would be like cable
crossovers for the chest,
3777.27 the peak contraction is at the end,
3780.03 whereas something like an incline press,
3781.83 there's more of a stretch
provided it's done
3783.39 over a full range of
motion at the beginning
3785.61 of the movement.
3786.443 So again, something
where there's a stretch
3787.38 and something where
there's a peak contraction.
3788.88 For the shoulders, it's a
little bit harder to do,
3790.71 although there are ways to do that.
3791.73 And Jeff Cavaliere has
excellent workouts available,
3794.654 zero cost, on YouTube.
3796.35 He also has excellent programs
on his athleanx.com site.
3799.62 but certainly has a lot
of excellent protocols
3802.68 on his YouTube and Instagram.
3804.24 But on YouTube you can
put in his name and any
3808.65 muscle group that you want to train.
3809.82 And he has some terrific
videos describing exercise
3813.123 choice and other features
of exercise parameters.
3816.36 Again, a peak contraction
or shortening of the muscle,
3820.95 peak contraction exercise
and a stretching exercise.
3823.047 And so for the back, one might say, okay,
3826.53 a seated row or a bent
over row or a dumbbell row
3830.46 where the elbow is
brought behind the torso
3832.32 for a peak contraction movement.
3834.15 And then for more of a
stretching movement might
3836.4 be something like a chin up or a pull-up.
3838.95 And as I say this,
3839.79 I understand that stretching
and peak contraction
3843.09 aren't the exact terms that
one would use if they were
3845.755 a physiotherapist or a strength
and conditioning coach,
3848.67 but I think for the
typical person who's trying
3851.13 to generate strength and
hypertrophy in those muscles
3853.53 or maintain strength and
hypertrophy in those muscles,
3855.717 this kind of nomenclature
way of describing
3858.18 it at least should be
clear and even efficient.
3861.9 And just to remind you,
as with the leg workout,
3865.41 the total duration of the
torso workout is going to be
3868.71 50 to 60 minutes after a brief warmup.
3871.47 The sets and repetitions
are going to be dictated
3874.95 in the same way that I described earlier.
3876.48 So for about a month it's
going to be more sets.
3880.62 So anywhere from three to five sets
3882.39 in the lower repetition range,
3883.89 so four to eight repetitions,
3886.17 so that's going to be heavier
weights and longer rest
3888.6 as I described earlier,
the rest intervals.
3890.52 And then for the next
month it's going to be
3892.13 moderate repetitions, fewer sets,
3894.504 the same way I described earlier.
3896.049 And if you want more
details on all of that,
3898.8 you can find that in
the newsletter related
3901.56 to the optimal or
foundational fitness protocol
3904.47 that you can access at hubermanlab.com.
3906.42 One thing I should note
about the Wednesday torso
3908.46 workout is that I am a
big believer in training
3911.224 the, what I believe is the highly avoided,
3915.21 or at least overlooked but
vitally important aspect
3918.366 of total body stability,
strength and safety, really,
3922.11 safety, which is the neck.
3923.547 Now I realize a lot of people
don't want a large neck,
3926.07 and I totally understand
for aesthetic reasons
3927.99 why they don't want that.
3929.28 It's kind of interesting
actually, if you think about it,
3931.05 that people who have a
large neck are often told
3933.15 they have no neck.
3934.26 People say that guy has no
neck or they have no neck
3937.11 when in fact they're referring to the fact
3938.58 that they have a very large neck.
3939.66 I don't know how that came to be.
3940.5 Somebody put in the comments why that is,
3942.24 how come when people have
a big neck they refer
3944.13 to it as no neck.
3945.6 So why do I train the neck?
3946.59 I train the neck for a couple of reasons.
3948.27 One is years ago I had an
accent where I actually fell
3950.46 off a roof and I'd been
training my neck at that time
3955.08 for a sport that I was
involved in and I walked
3957.36 away from it with a sore
neck but not a broken neck.
3959.37 And I thought, wow, it's
really great that I have
3962.67 been training my neck.
3963.81 In addition to that,
3964.77 I was once in a car accident
where I was parked...
3968.012 I just bought the car, was
my first new car purchased,
3971.49 parked in that car with my mother,
3973.98 my grandfather in the
backseat at the red light
3976.89 and someone rammed into us at full speed.
3978.84 Now fortunately, none of us
were hurt. We were all rattled.
3983.43 And once again, I was very
sore in my back and in my neck.
3987.51 But I think one of the
reasons why I was able
3990.21 to essentially walk away from that,
3991.71 I didn't have any sustained damage was
3994.32 because I trained my neck,
3995.43 but I started training my
neck for sport and I continue
3998.43 to train my neck because I
notice when I don't train
4000.38 my neck I start getting shoulder issues.
4002.21 And if you talk to an
excellent physiologist like
4005.69 Dr. Kelly Starrett of The Ready State,
4008.54 is an excellent channel,
4009.938 you can find them on all the social media
4010.91 and standard channels
or you talk to anyone
4013.796 out there who really
understands the strength
4016.52 of the torso and the upper
body and even the back.
4019.01 What you learn is that, of course,
4021.2 being the upper portion of the spine,
4023.24 stabilizing your neck is very important.
4025.4 Now, training the neck can
be a little bit detailed
4027.74 and specific and even
dangerous if you do it wrong.
4030.29 Again, Jeff Cavaliere has
a terrific set of videos
4032.6 on training the neck properly.
4033.8 I know a lot of people
out there might think neck
4035.66 bridges and I used to do neck bridges.
4037.73 I occasionally still sneak in
a neck bridge here or there,
4041.24 although I don't recommend
it because in discussions
4042.848 with Jeff, he will tell
you, and it's true,
4045.885 that the discs eventually
go and you can run
4049.34 into serious issues from doing bridges
4051.26 and it doesn't happen
gradually so you can't
4053.18 notice it happening.
4054.013 It just happens suddenly.
4055.22 So I might occasionally do a neck bridge,
4057.59 but in general I'll train
neck by wrapping a plate
4060.2 in a towel so that I don't
end up with an imprint
4062.09 of the weight value on my head or face.
4064.538 And then moving the neck
from side to side or front
4067.43 or back, and again, we'll
provide a link to those videos.
4070.61 It's a terrific set of
videos that describe
4072.26 how to train your neck
properly and safely.
4074.3 So even if you're not
trying to grow your neck,
4076.276 you definitely want to
make sure that you use
4077.93 some light weights to
make sure that your neck
4079.88 is stable and upright.
4081.647 And I say stable and upright
because it's very clear
4084.8 that for reasons related
to texting and staring down
4088.25 at computers and related
to weak neck relative
4091.67 to the rest of the muscles
that stabilize the spine,
4094.012 a lot of people,
4096.14 their default stance or
their default posture
4098.45 is with chin forward and that's not good.
4101.54 Not only is it aesthetically not good,
4104.54 but it also can create all
sorts of issues related
4106.67 to back pain and headaches
and things of that sort.
4108.74 This is a real thing,
4109.91 training your neck allows you to stand
4111.32 upright, sit upright.
4112.67 I even believe that it
allows you to do things like
4114.77 public speaking or have
conversations with people
4116.6 on the street in a way
where you are front facing
4118.97 as opposed to looking down.
4120.35 So Wednesday is torso
and neck and then comes
4124.43 Thursday and that means
another cardiovascular
4128.24 exercise session,
although it's a brief one.
4132.08 Unlike the endurance training
4133.82 on Sunday, the cardiovascular session
4135.95 on Thursday, and again,
4138.11 for me it falls on Thursday,
but for it could fall
4140.21 on a different day depending
on when you started
4142.04 this protocol, is going
to be about, again,
4146.39 about 35 minutes of, for me, running,
4150.122 although it could be rowing
or it could be cycling,
4152.75 it could be something of that sort.
4154.67 The goal of this workout
is what's important.
4156.68 The goal of this workout is to tap into,
4158.81 remember that long list
that we talked about earlier
4160.49 where you've got skill and speed and power
4162.08 and strength and hypertrophy, et cetera,
4163.37 different forms of endurance,
4164.6 is to get into that range of endurance
4167.27 where your heart rate is
elevated quite a bit more
4170.54 than zone two,
4172.04 but that you're not really
going all out sprint.
4174.95 So what that means for me
is warming up for about 5
4177.65 to 10 minutes.
4178.483 That could be jogging, a little
bit of light calisthenics,
4180.71 might even be hopping
on a stationary bike,
4182.45 although to be honest I
loathe the stationary bike,
4184.67 and then setting a timer
and doing about 30,
4188.75 but ideally 35 minutes of what I call
4193.43 75% to 80% of all out.
4196.16 Okay, now I realize this
spits in the face of all
4199.01 you heart rate monitor wearing
super techy exercise types.
4204.47 But when I think of all out
sprint, I think of 100%.
4209.357 And what is that?
4210.35 In my mind that's somebody is chasing me
4212.48 with a needle full of
poison and I am sprinting
4215.63 away at maximal speed.
4217.73 That for me is 100%.
4219.5 So after a brief warm up,
4220.76 what I'm going to do is
go out, typically outside,
4223.55 although sometimes it
has to be on a treadmill
4225.23 if I'm traveling, and move,
run for about 30 to 35 minutes
4230.54 at about 75% or 80% of that all out.
4234.11 What that means is that I'm
striving to keep a steady pace,
4237.449 but in reality I don't.
4239.905 I sometimes have to stop at
a stoplight, there are cars,
4242.6 please don't run into
traffic just to maintain
4244.134 that speed and that timing,
4245.93 that would be terribly
antagonistic to fitness,
4250.61 in particular, lifespan.
4253.04 That running tends to be running
4254.93 in which I'm breathing
hard so I'm not able
4256.97 to restrict myself to
purely nasal breathing.
4259.07 And I should have mentioned earlier,
4260.39 on the Sunday long ruck
or weighted hike or jog,
4265.55 if I'm alone, I try and
do pure nasal breathing.
4267.934 If I'm with other people or I'm talking,
4270.38 obviously I'm not going
to do pure nasal breathing
4272.63 because I'm talking, although
I'm sure that sometimes
4275.3 they wish I was doing
pure nasal breathing.
4277.01 That Thursday workout
accomplishes a number of things.
4279.35 First of all, it really
gets my heart rate up
4282.071 and it improves multiple
aspects of endurance,
4285.32 because as you recall earlier,
4287.12 the different bins of
endurance that include
4289.22 muscular endurance, anaerobic,
that 3 to 12 minute range
4291.71 and then 30 minutes or longer,
4293.42 none of them really precisely
match what's accomplished
4296.06 in this 35 minute or so
cardiovascular session
4300.32 where I'm pushing hard but not all out.
4304.37 But that's exactly the reason to do it,
4306.08 which is that it taps
into multiple fuel systems
4309.05 for the muscle and multiple
aspects of the heart
4312.95 and capillaries and
arteries and veins that are
4314.51 involved in generating that movement.
4316.16 So it really cuts a
broad swath into multiple
4318.26 categories of endurance.
4319.49 And also just keep in mind
what this foundational
4322.58 or optimal fitness protocol
is really designed to do.
4326.06 In my mind, a foundational
fitness protocol is one
4329.54 that leaves you or has you
in a state where if you need
4333.68 to walk really far and
carry a bunch of weight,
4335.69 you can do it.
4336.71 If you need to lift a heavy
object with your legs,
4338.87 you can do it.
4339.86 If you need to run really
fast for two minutes,
4343.97 you can do it.
4345.02 And if you need to run
a little bit further,
4348.86 like maybe in 10 minutes
for whatever reason,
4351.11 you can do that.
4351.943 So it's a really kind of
all around fitness program
4354.56 and that 35 minute run, again,
4356.6 could be swapped with a 35 minute erg row.
4359.27 Or sometimes if you only have access
4361.1 to a stationary bike, you could do that.
4362.865 I suppose if you didn't
have access to any equipment
4365.24 and running is not your thing,
one thing that I have done,
4368.42 especially if I've been
stuck in a hotel 'cause
4369.98 I arrived late someplace
and I really want to get
4371.69 this workout in, you could
do the dreaded burpee.
4374.54 I know there are a lot
of opinions out there,
4376.04 some people think burpees
are downright dangerous,
4377.78 other people love burpees.
4379.37 You could do that.
4380.557 Or you could do really fast
but full jumping jacks.
4384.292 I know that's a little PE class, right?
4387.53 Physical education class-ish.
4389.265 But sometimes if I need
to get the workout in,
4391.64 what I'll do in a hotel
if I've arrived late
4394.07 in particular day of travel
is I will find the stairwell,
4396.98 the fire stairwell, I'll
make sure by the way
4398.69 that I can get back into the
building 'cause I've been
4400.61 locked in those stairwells before.
4402.29 And I will simply walk
really fast up the stairwell
4405.14 as many flights of stairs as there are,
4406.88 or maybe even jog it, not quite sprint,
4409.353 but a run up those stairs
over and over and over again
4412.67 in order to get that 35
minutes of 75% to 80%
4415.551 of max output cardiovascular work done.
4418.97 And if I'm really just
restricted to my hotel room,
4421.562 I'll just do jumping
jacks for 30, 35 minutes,
4424.22 sometimes while watching something on TV.
4425.9 And believe me, if you're
doing full jumping jacks,
4427.79 like really extending your legs,
4429.41 really getting arms
overhead and really doing
4431.167 the full movement, by the
time you hit five or six
4434.043 minutes you are going to be
sweating and your heart rate
4437.75 is really going to be up.
4438.74 I also sometimes will
travel with a jump rope.
4440.45 I always try and travel with
a jump rope and skip rope,
4444.02 much to the dismay of
the people who are housed
4445.94 below me in the hotel room.
4447.29 Skipping rope, I should mention,
4448.58 can be a very effective way of getting
4450.59 cardiovascular training
while you're on the road.
4452.93 But in all seriousness,
4454.07 if you're in a hotel room or an apartment
4455.87 and you can't really jump
high and you're very good
4458.0 at jumping rope, what you'll
find is it's not going to
4459.86 get you into that higher
elevated heart rate zone.
4464.09 Okay?
4464.923 It can be great for
zone two type training,
4465.98 but if you're really
good at skipping rope,
4467.414 and I wouldn't say I'm really good at it,
4469.43 but I've done enough skipping
rope that I can just kind
4471.2 of cruise and talk and
it, it's more zone twoish,
4474.11 even feels like walking at times.
4475.61 Now you can do double unders
4476.72 where you're really jumping
and putting the rope
4478.85 under you twice each time
or crossovers, et cetera,
4481.4 depending on your skill level.
4483.14 But again, if you're in an
apartment or you're in a hotel,
4485.06 that's going to be harder to do.
4486.061 And because there's some skill involved,
4488.74 sometimes you're stopping more often
4490.76 than you're continuing.
4492.14 By the way, and I just
have to mention this,
4493.819 a really terrific Instagram
channel is @anna.skips.
4496.97 This is a teacher, a science teacher,
4498.89 or I believe it's a math,
4500.66 maths as they say in the
UK 'cause she's in the UK,
4503.39 maths teacher.
4504.223 I don't know Anna, but I
know she skips 'cause she has
4506.75 this amazing Instagram
channel called Anna Skips.
4508.85 And what's really cool
4509.78 about her Instagram is she
shows you her progression
4512.9 from not being able to skip rope at all
4514.28 to the absolutely incredible
types of rope skipping
4516.98 that she's doing each morning
while getting sunlight,
4518.78 which of course is
essential health protocol.
4521.48 So check out Anna Skips on
Instagram, really inspiring
4524.34 and made me want to get
better at skipping rope.
4527.36 I'm still working at it.
4528.5 Okay, so with that
Thursday cardiovascular,
4530.93 let's call it endurance,
4531.92 but cardiovascular training workout done,
4534.56 around roles Friday and
on Friday I'm going to do
4537.664 another cardiovascular training session,
4540.53 and I alluded to this earlier,
4541.7 but this cardiovascular
training session is also
4544.01 designed to tap into some
of the ability of hard,
4551.017 I should say high intensity
interval training,
4553.85 to tap into strength and
hypertrophy increases
4557.48 for the legs.
4558.313 'Cause remember, we train legs
4559.88 on Monday and what the science tells us
4563.75 is that protein synthesis
in a muscle group can
4566.18 be stimulated about every 42 to 72 hours.
4569.51 And so we've had Tuesday off,
4571.88 Wednesday off and Thursday
off and you don't want to
4575.9 lose progress that you
made from that terrific
4579.02 Monday leg workout.
4580.7 But in order to make sure
that you can do the other
4583.37 things that follow in this
program and pick back up
4585.766 on Monday with another leg workout,
4588.38 at least for me with my recovery abilities
4590.48 and my work schedule,
4591.83 I'm not going to do an
entire other leg workout
4594.41 because it's going to set
the whole thing out of whack.
4597.2 That is, I won't be
able to consistently do
4598.91 the same workouts on the
same days of each week.
4601.01 Now with that said,
4602.03 a little bit later I'll
explain what happens
4603.44 if you have to miss a workout
and how you can combine
4605.197 days, et cetera.
4606.35 But I really strive to
get certain workouts done
4610.16 on certain days consistently
at least as best I can.
4612.74 So Friday is high intensity
interval training,
4615.566 and that can take a
variety of different forms.
4617.665 For me, the ideal thing
to do, for me, again,
4621.65 you could do something
completely different.
4623.75 Exercise choice, again, should be governed
4625.97 by what you can do safely
so you don't injure yourself
4628.538 and that you can perform
effectively and that gets
4631.19 you or provides you the
stimulus that you want.
4633.71 And what I'm trying to do
on Friday is get my heart
4636.23 rate way, way up.
4637.58 Talked about this in the
episode with Dr. Andy Galpin.
4640.07 In addition to the benefits
of getting 180-200 minutes
4643.88 of zone two cardio per week, minimum,
4647.0 it's a really good idea to
get up to that max or near max
4650.57 heart rate at least once a week.
4652.283 And you're not going to do that
for very long periods of time.
4654.68 You're not going to do
that for 30 minutes.
4655.88 You can't sprint all out for 30 minutes
4657.77 unless you're Steve Prefontaine.
4659.63 If you haven't seen
4660.463 the movies "Without
Limits" or "Prefontaine,"
4662.297 you should absolutely see those.
4664.04 He was able to go out and run 12 laps,
4667.34 what seemed to be an all
out sprint or close to it.
4670.94 Incredible.
4671.773 But most people are not
going to do that or going
4674.78 be carried away on a
stretcher if they try.
4677.54 These high intensity
interval training for me
4679.76 ideally would be on so-called
assault bike or Airdyne bikes.
4682.91 So these bikes that have the
fan, which might seem like,
4685.61 oh, just cools you off,
4686.99 but actually there's a
lot of resistance there.
4688.88 So what I will typically
do is a 20 to 30 second
4693.02 all out sprint using arms and
legs and then 10 seconds rest
4697.79 and then repeat all out sprint for 20
4700.83 to 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat.
4704.12 And I'll do that for anywhere
from 8 to 12 rounds, which,
4709.46 trust me, even if you start
out a little bit less,
4712.76 or I should say not all
out intensity or effort,
4715.4 by the time you hit
the fifth or sixth one,
4717.08 you will be certainly
headed into if not near
4721.16 your maximum heart rate.
4722.33 Now what is your maximum heart rate?
4723.47 Do you need a heart rate monitor? No.
4725.06 If you like using that
sort of thing, great.
4727.28 But again, Andy Galpin
beautifully supplied us
4730.43 with the information.
4731.42 He said if you take the
number 220 and you subtract
4734.0 your age, that for most people, most,
4736.94 is going to be your maximum heart rate.
4738.41 Although for certain
people who are very fit
4740.12 or certain ages, that's
not going to apply.
4742.07 So it's a little bit too crude to measure,
4744.2 but it's a good starting
place and you can look up
4745.847 other information or see
that podcast episode,
4748.25 we provide the link to it
in the show note captions
4750.05 if you want to get more details on that.
4752.09 I don't use a heart rate monitor.
4753.38 What I'm trying to do is get to that point
4755.24 where I quote unquote
feel like I want to die.
4758.24 Now I don't want to die,
and please don't die, right?
4761.36 If you're not in good
cardiovascular health,
4763.04 do not just jump right
into this fitness protocol.
4766.07 But I want to get to the
point where I really feel like
4768.32 I could not pedal any
faster or pull any faster
4771.924 on the assault bike, the Airdyne bike,
4774.8 or if I'm doing this workout
in a place or at a time
4778.25 or because I choose to
not use a bike or a rower,
4781.88 'cause you could also use a rower,
4783.17 I will simply do sprint jog intervals.
4786.44 I will sprint for 20 or 30 seconds,
4788.408 then jog for 10 seconds,
sprint for 20 or 30 seconds,
4791.72 and then jog for 10
seconds and just repeat.
4793.97 I used to have a big field
next to my laboratory,
4796.49 my old laboratory, and I
used to bring my bulldog
4798.56 Costello out there.
4799.393 He was really good at the
first sprint part and then
4801.655 he would just lie down and watch.
4802.85 he didn't even do the jog part.
4804.2 I would just go back and
forth, back and forth,
4805.61 back and forth, panting
like a bulldog nonstop,
4808.88 barely able to recover
before sprinting again.
4811.817 And the basis of this workout
again is several fold.
4814.46 First of all, it's to get
the heart rate really high,
4816.74 up towards maximum heart
rate at least once a week.
4819.95 So you accomplish that this Friday.
4821.21 Also, if you are
sprinting and then jogging
4824.27 or you are really pushing
hard on an assault bike
4826.61 or an Airdyne bike, or
using a, for instance,
4829.13 a skier or a skier machine or any number
4831.89 of different cardiovascular
training tools,
4836.12 you are going to get
activation of the legs,
4840.74 of course not to the
same degree as you would
4842.48 with squats or dead lifts or
leg extensions or leg curls.
4844.94 That's simply not the case.
4846.44 But you're going to trigger
strength and hypertrophy
4849.738 and other types of adaptations
in those muscle groups.
4852.77 So this for me also represents
the second leg workout
4856.25 of the week where I'm
not touching any weights.
4858.83 One important point that
I don't think I've heard
4860.48 mentioned anywhere else,
but that I hope to have
4863.69 Dr. Kelly Starrett on
the podcast to discuss
4865.58 and that I've discussed
with him one on one,
4868.28 which is be careful with
all out sprints or all
4872.12 out anything cardiovascular exercise,
4874.01 you can get injured doing those.
4875.523 So for instance, if you
go out and you just sprint
4877.91 across a field, all out,
4879.71 20 or 30 seconds and
then walk back and can do
4881.87 it again and again,
4883.19 don't be surprised if the
next day you have some
4885.41 sciatica or even some pelvic floor pain.
4888.68 I don't recommend going
all out on any movement
4892.25 that you can't perform with perfect form.
4895.46 Okay?
4896.293 So for me, I really try and
stay away from all out sprints.
4899.24 I'll sprint it about 95% of what I can do
4901.88 because I find if I go all out sprint,
4904.4 I don't know what the reason is,
4905.45 but it might be an over
extension of a limb
4907.43 or something like that,
I'm not a sprinter,
4909.11 I'm not a sprinting coach.
4910.22 I do hope to get Stu McMillan
on here or Dan Pfaff,
4914.32 who are excellent sprinting coaches,
4916.13 at some point they were world
class sprinting coaches,
4918.92 but I'm not a pro sprinter,
4921.77 I'm not even a amateur sprinter,
I'm a fitness sprinter.
4924.857 So the Airdyne or assault
bike or the rower is really
4928.13 a safer option for me.
4929.39 And if I'm running or I'm doing some sort
4931.033 of movement where I'm
unconstrained, really,
4933.83 in terms of how far my stride is,
4935.48 I mean I'm obviously
constrained by the musculature,
4937.61 I'm really careful to not overextend or do
4940.37 something like that.
4941.203 And the only way to do
that is to not go all out.
4942.83 So again, the goal for this Friday workout
4944.28 is to really get the heart rate high,
4946.13 do high intensity interval training...
4948.387 A number of different
ways you could do that.
4949.46 You can look up HIIT,
HIIT workouts online,
4952.52 find the one that's best
for you and really pick
4953.99 something that's safe that
you can do consistently,
4956.45 and I believe that ideally
will also trigger a bit
4959.238 of either strength and
hypertrophy and speed
4962.66 power maintenance or even
give you a little bit
4965.18 of a stimulus so that by
the time you roll around
4967.97 to that leg workout on,
again, on Monday, you've got
4970.61 a little bit of an additional
boost to your leg strength,
4973.64 hypertrophy, speed and power.
4975.59 So we've covered Sunday
through Friday, and then
4978.414 Saturday rolls around and
Saturday is when you train arms,
4984.77 calves, and neck.
4985.82 So this may sound as if
you're training a bunch
4988.52 of small muscle groups, biceps,
triceps, necks and calves,
4991.7 and that's true, but I
should mention that you are
4994.28 also training your torso a
second time and you're doing
4998.21 it indirectly, or
sometimes not indirectly.
5001.021 Why do I say this?
5002.17 Well, keep in mind, again,
5003.134 that for strength and hypertrophy,
5004.989 you're going for that once
about every 48 to 72 hours,
5009.31 you want to stimulate that,
5011.32 on Wednesday is when you
train your torso, right?
5014.11 Chest, shoulders, back and neck.
5016.96 You've had Thursday to
rest, Friday to rest.
5019.87 I know a lot of people are
going to want to emphasize
5021.76 those body parts and
they're going to think,
5022.75 oh, you have to train it twice a week.
5024.25 But if you have modest recovery ability
5028.99 or low recovery ability, such as I do,
5031.66 and you're doing these
other cardiovascular
5033.34 training sessions, et cetera,
5035.08 well then, on Saturday is
when you will train arms,
5038.38 calves and neck directly.
5039.67 But included in that,
5041.2 remember, two exercises per muscle group,
5043.06 one with a peak contraction,
5044.35 one with somewhat of a stretch in there.
5046.6 Included in that, I
suggest doing some sort
5049.343 of dip movement, which I
think it was Pavel Tsatsouline
5053.35 said the dip is synonymous
5055.33 with or at least similar
to an upper body squat.
5057.7 Excuse me, Pavel if I got that wrong.
5059.32 Maybe it wasn't you that said that,
5060.52 but big admirer of his work,
5062.83 and certainly the dip is
a great exercise to hit
5065.35 multiple muscle groups,
chest, shoulders, and triceps,
5069.049 maybe even some back to
some extent depending
5071.14 on how you do it.
5072.19 So doing some dipping
movement will indirectly
5076.0 stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera,
5078.58 in the chest and shoulders
and including some sort
5081.91 of pulling movement for the bicep,
5083.71 like a chin up or palms facing movement,
5087.79 pulling up from to the bar,
5090.25 especially if it's a
close grip type movement.
5092.05 But even if it's a wide
grip type movement,
5094.09 will of course trigger strength
5096.22 and hypertrophy, maintenance
or improvements in the biceps,
5100.06 but will also trigger strength
hypertrophy in the lats
5105.37 in the back.
5106.33 Okay, so Saturday is this arm workout
5108.49 that I'll just give an
example of a potential
5110.86 workout where you might
do a few more exercises
5113.317 and maybe not just two,
5114.25 but maybe three to make sure you get
5115.48 the torso indirect stimulation.
5117.55 So what would this look like?
5118.9 Well, this might be your
sort of classic dumbbell
5121.27 curls for the bicep and maybe incline curl
5124.66 for the bicep because
it has more of a stretch
5126.22 on an incline bench,
5127.72 and then you might finish
with two sets of chin ups.
5131.292 So palms facing you, chin ups,
5133.0 or three sets of chin-ups depending
5134.32 on whether or not you're
in a heavier load month
5136.48 or a more moderate weight month.
5138.73 Again, activating the biceps
muscles 'cause arms day,
5142.45 but also activating
strength and hypertrophy
5145.21 in the lats or at least maintaining it
5146.74 so that, because you're not training
5149.35 those torso muscles again
5150.67 until Wednesday, you're not
allowing the hypertrophy
5154.18 and strength gains that you generated
5156.029 on Wednesday to atrophy, to disappear.
5159.76 Then, thinking about triceps,
5162.67 it might be some sort of triceps isolation
5164.62 or peak contraction movement.
5165.85 So that could be tricep kickback or some
5167.746 overhead extension would
be more of a stretch
5170.08 type movement than a kickback.
5171.37 But then also doing regular old dips.
5173.68 You might even start
with dips, which again,
5175.24 are going to activate those
torso muscles and the triceps.
5178.6 And then calf work in the same
way that you did on Monday.
5182.53 And neck work...
5183.61 Again, I am a believer
in training neck multiple
5186.01 times per week.
5187.003 And if you are able to
finish all of that in 45
5190.97 or 50 minutes, great.
5192.13 Most people will find
when you're doing a lot
5193.69 of small muscle groups,
5194.523 it actually takes longer
because you have to go around
5196.6 to more exercises.
5197.95 But again, just adhere
to the same principles
5199.75 we talked about before,
5201.04 about 50, five zero, to
60 minutes of real work
5203.8 after a warmup with an
asterisk next to that,
5206.35 that if someone's on the
equipment or you can't find
5208.12 the dumbbells you need, et cetera,
5210.31 then maybe 75 minutes max.
5212.29 But really trying to not
extend that workout too long,
5215.44 making sure that you
activate the arms directly,
5218.77 but also activating the
torso muscles indirectly,
5221.83 and again, I won't repeat
it this time, again,
5224.95 but following the same
weight and repetition
5227.384 and rest interval scheme
that we talked about earlier,
5229.733 a bit heavier, lower reps,
5231.646 more sets and longer
rest for about a month.
5236.05 And then alternating to more repetitions
5239.08 yet fewer sets, right?
5242.65 Shorter rest intervals and
do that for about a month.
5245.56 This carries through
for all the resistance
5247.21 training workouts regardless
of the day of the week.
5249.67 So we've completed the
total arc across the week
5251.86 and we can summarize
it as saying Sunday is,
5254.92 let's just say long endurance,
5256.36 Monday is leg resistance training,
5258.82 Tuesday, heat cold contrast,
5261.07 Wednesday, torso training plus neck,
5264.85 Thursday, I would call
it moderate intensity
5268.78 cardiovascular exercise, so that 35 minute
5271.42 moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise,
5273.28 Friday, high intensity
interval training of sprinting
5276.79 or some variation thereof
and Saturday, arms, calves,
5280.18 neck and torso, indirect work.
5282.88 That's the total structure.
5284.62 But I want to emphasize again,
5285.7 you do not need to start this on Sunday.
5287.17 That is, you could make the
long endurance work start
5290.83 on Tuesday and then just fill in the rest
5293.246 as described before.
5295.48 It's really up to you.
5297.4 There's another important
point I want to make,
5299.14 which is that neither
I nor anyone is going
5303.07 to be successful in
doing the exact workouts
5305.87 on the exact same days of
every week because of travel,
5308.89 work, illness, other demands, et cetera.
5311.68 The thing about the
schedule that I like so much
5313.48 that I do believe that
will benefit you as well
5316.407 is that you have some flexibility there.
5318.52 What's the flexibility?
5319.45 Well, let's say you train
your typical Sunday workout
5322.33 of endurance, then you train
legs on Monday and then
5325.84 you don't manage to do
your heat cold contrast
5329.56 on Tuesday for whatever reason.
5331.12 Well, you can put it on Wednesday.
5333.94 Just make sure that if you're going to do
5335.38 the cold stimulus, that
you don't do it too close,
5338.74 not within four, ideally
eight hours after the training
5344.08 of torso, but you could do
it before or you could do it
5347.23 just heat and skip the cold
that particular week, right?
5351.13 Not ideal, but better
than not doing anything.
5353.477 Let's say, for instance,
5354.64 the leg workout was particularly brutal,
5356.2 you don't sleep that well on
Monday night or Tuesday night.
5359.41 Well then should you do the
torso workout on Wednesday?
5363.13 Well, I would say,
5365.02 why not move the heat cold contrast
5367.15 to Wednesday and then
push that torso workout
5370.93 to Thursday and maybe also
try and do that 35 minute
5374.89 run on Thursday every once
in a while rather than lose
5378.67 the total control of the program and let
5380.44 everything shuffle forward.
5381.67 Here's the basic principle.
5383.47 I do believe that any
one of these workouts,
5386.53 whether it's for endurance
or resistance training,
5388.27 can be shifted either
one day forward or one
5390.56 day back, right?
5392.89 You could delay it by a
day or you could accelerate
5395.104 it by a day in order to
make sure that you get
5398.53 everything done across the week.
5400.93 In fact, I would say the best way to think
5402.97 about this foundational
fitness program is not
5406.342 from the details up,
but from the top down,
5409.93 from the big picture down to the details,
5412.15 and say to yourself,
5413.29 once a week you're going to
get some long endurance in,
5416.35 another day during the week,
5417.43 you're going to make
sure that you get a kind
5418.72 of moderate faster endurance workout in,
5421.78 and then one other day during the week,
5423.94 you're going to get an all out sprint,
5425.56 high intensity cardiovascular
exercise workout in.
5429.1 You're going to get those
three workouts in somehow.
5431.95 And then in addition to that,
5432.97 you will also do resistance training
5435.34 for every muscle group in your body.
5437.47 And that means doing your legs
hard at least once a week,
5441.43 your torso hard at least once
a week and your arms hard
5445.81 at least once a week.
5446.643 And of course you are
also paying attention
5448.39 to training your calves.
5449.61 And I do, for reasons I described before,
5452.26 believe that you want to
train your neck at least
5454.48 to keep it strong.
5455.41 You may not want to
generate hypertrophy there.
5458.14 People vary in terms of how
quickly their neck grows.
5460.42 Some people grows very, very fast.
5461.65 Other people, for the life of them,
5463.0 they can't get much
hypertrophy in their neck.
5464.56 But keeping that neck strong,
5466.12 at least through some very
light work to moderate
5469.06 weight work, very, very important,
5471.91 for reasons I stated earlier.
5473.59 If you set out those goals,
5476.44 then the specific days that
you do each workout isn't
5479.849 as critical, but the specific spacing is.
5482.83 So for instance, you're
not going to want to do
5484.57 your high intensity
interval training the day
5486.91 after you train your legs,
5488.59 because if you're doing
5489.423 that high intensity
interval training correctly,
5491.56 you're going to be
5493.21 taxing your legs and
eating into their recovery.
5495.97 And so you want to space them
out by two or three days.
5498.31 So I think you'll notice
that the point is really
5499.845 to optimize everything on
the whole rather than any
5504.4 one specific aspect of
training or adaptation.
5507.88 Now that said, I do realize
that some people might
5511.12 be hyper focused on things like strength
5513.46 and hypertrophy and the
aesthetics that come with it.
5515.993 A key point about strength hypertrophy
5517.87 and weight training, and this is something
5519.64 that has been covered
on multiple podcasts,
5521.59 certainly the one with Jeff Cavaliere
5522.91 and with Dr. Andy Galpin and the one
5524.86 that I did on building muscle
strength and hypertrophy,
5528.88 the solo episode.
5531.07 And that is the following,
5534.01 it is the rare individual
who has perfectly
5536.77 balanced musculature, right?
5538.75 Most people can be a bit quad dominant
5541.6 or hamstring dominant,
or they have trouble
5543.55 activating their glutes
or somebody has a terrible
5546.58 time trying to activate
their chest muscles,
5548.86 but they're very strong
in the back, et cetera.
5551.53 It's very clear that we can
know that not just based
5555.7 on aesthetics, right, but based
5558.64 on deliberate contractibility
of those muscles.
5561.94 So I don't want to get into
this in too much detail
5563.65 for sake of time,
5564.61 but this is something that
has peer reviewed research
5567.22 to support it and was
also discussed extensively
5569.71 with Jeff Cavaliere when he was a guest.
5572.05 And that actually he's really
popularized this notion
5574.57 and it's absolutely true,
5575.71 which is that if you can
contract a muscle very hard
5578.35 to the point where it almost
feels like it's cramping,
5580.06 if you can do that even
when there's no weight
5582.07 in your hand or there's
no resistance against it,
5584.86 so you're just using your
mind muscle connection
5587.05 to contract that muscle
hard and isolate it,
5588.82 chances are you'll be able
to generate hypertrophy
5591.64 and strength gains pretty
easily in that muscle
5594.28 compared to muscles that you
have a harder time activating.
5597.91 So during all resistance
training, that mind muscle link
5600.43 is really important, so much
so that some people will
5604.06 even try and emphasize
contraction of the muscles
5606.28 in between sets, et cetera.
5607.626 I personally, because I'm
not somebody who likes
5610.63 a mirror when I work out, and
I'm not somebody who wants
5613.84 to spend time in between
sets flexing muscles
5615.847 and et cetera for whatever reason,
5618.34 I want to actually rest between sets,
5619.78 and I'm more concerned with performance
5621.76 during those sets and
really putting my mind
5623.26 into the muscle during the set,
5625.27 I really try and emphasize
deep relaxation between sets.
5628.15 And so here's a tool that again is built
5630.49 out of science and I should
say peer reviewed studies,
5633.55 some of which are being done in my lab,
5635.11 but other labs as well,
5636.31 which is that in between
sets what I really strive
5639.01 to do is to bring my heart
rate down as much as possible,
5641.92 calm myself down as much as possible,
5643.81 and I'll do the so-called
physiological sigh in order
5646.42 to do that.
5647.253 That's two inhales through the
nose, back to back, [sighs]
5651.94 and then long full
exhale through the mouth.
5654.37 I just did it partially there
for the sake of time, again.
5657.13 So a big deep inhale through
the nose and then sneak
5659.83 in a little bit more on a second inhale
5661.3 to maximally inflate the
lungs and the alveoli
5662.88 in the lungs, and then a
full exhale of all your air
5666.79 via the mouth to empty your lungs.
5668.38 That's the fastest way that
we are aware of to calm
5672.206 your nervous system down.
5674.02 And really, in between sets you can use
5676.21 that to calm yourself
down and conserve energy.
5678.34 But then as you move into
the weight training set,
5682.18 you really want to ratchet
up your focus and attention
5685.18 to the muscles that
you're going to be using.
5686.74 Now, I'd like to acknowledge
that there's a huge range
5688.6 of parameters in terms of
how to actually perform
5691.27 during the set.
5692.103 You can focus on a
particular muscle and try
5693.958 and really isolate from the
beginning of the movement.
5696.76 Some people will really
try and isolate it only
5698.65 during the peak contraction.
5699.64 Some people accentuate the negative.
5701.05 There's speed and cadence.
5702.123 There are, again,
remember, concepts are few,
5705.91 methods are many.
5706.75 And if you're interested
in the various methods
5708.46 of eccentrics and concentrics
and all the different
5711.52 ways of changing up cadence
and so forth during sets,
5715.03 there's an enormous amount
of quality information
5717.13 out there, far too much for
us to get into detail now.
5720.19 But what I describe the general principles
5721.75 of how to set your mind, if
you will, during the set,
5724.96 you should be focused on the
muscles that you're using
5726.82 and or moving the weight.
5727.87 If movement of the
weight is more important,
5729.43 you can either focus on moving the weight
5731.29 or challenging muscles, right?
5733.6 You can either try and
isolate muscles and make
5735.31 specific muscles do the work
or simply moving the weight.
5738.76 Moving the weight is
going to be more geared
5740.92 towards strength
improvements, but focusing
5744.88 on the muscle, so called
mind muscle link is going to
5746.77 shift that very same set
more toward hypertrophy.
5749.62 I realize I'm painting
with a broad brush here,
5751.48 but nonetheless this
is grounded in the way
5753.67 that the nervous system
governs muscular contraction.
5756.91 And while I think most people are familiar
5758.449 with the number of different
variables associated
5760.75 with the resistance training,
sets, reps, rest intervals,
5763.81 cadence, et cetera, there
are also a tremendous number
5767.335 of very important variables
for endurance in any kind
5770.23 of cardiovascular training.
5771.94 And there are a lot of excellent resources
5773.74 out there about that.
5775.63 I think the most important one,
5777.97 in fact I will go on record
saying what I believe
5780.4 to be the most important
variable for any endurance
5784.69 or cardiovascular training
5785.77 is that because it's
a repetitive movement,
5788.56 that you are able to
complete the movement safely,
5791.5 meaning you're not putting
your body into range
5794.02 of motion or into positions
that can damage joints
5797.83 or put you in any kind
of compromised state.
5800.44 And some people might think, well,
5801.273 that seems kind of silly.
5802.42 But if you've ever set the, for instance,
5804.25 the seat too high on a
stationary bike and then
5806.14 done Airdyne or assault bike
type interval training sprints,
5810.25 if it's set too high and you're
over-striding, as it were,
5813.7 the next day, you can really
pay the price in terms
5816.16 of some back pain or sciatica.
5817.69 And sometimes that pain can
extend for quite a while.
5820.3 So of course you don't want
to approach any exercise
5822.19 with so much caution that
it's neurotic and preventive
5824.198 and yet you don't want to
approach any exercise in any way
5827.53 that's so cavalier,
5830.29 forgive the pun, Jeff,
that you're also going to
5833.35 compromise the integrity of your joints
5835.54 and musculature and connective tissue.
5837.28 Let's talk about some real
world practical variables.
5840.64 For instance,
5841.9 let's say you get a poor
to terrible night's sleep.
5845.56 Should you train the next day or not?
5847.72 Well, that really depends.
5849.16 I can honestly say I've
had some of the best
5851.35 training sessions, resistance training
5853.0 or endurance training
sessions after a really
5854.89 poor night's sleep.
5856.27 But that's the rare event.
5858.31 More often than not, if
I'm not sleeping well,
5862.15 I've had a terrible night's sleep,
5863.35 the next day I will just
skip training that day.
5866.92 I know that will shock a
number of you out there,
5868.87 or perhaps you're
already calling me names,
5870.88 weak, et cetera.
5872.23 But I find that if I've slept
really poorly or I've had
5875.11 a very stressful event
the day before and I don't
5877.958 sleep well, training
the next day sets me up
5880.75 for getting ill and getting
ill sets me up for not
5882.76 being able to train for multiple days.
5884.98 So it is my preference in
that case to skip a day
5888.4 and really focus on recovery.
5890.432 And then, as I mentioned earlier,
5892.81 slide that workout to the
next day and rarely double
5897.58 that workout up with another workout,
5899.26 but then just slide the
schedule forward by a day.
5901.69 But I really try and strive,
5903.46 that is, I really try to
double up at least some
5906.73 workouts later in the week in that case,
5908.83 so that I can get back
on schedule of starting
5912.1 the seven day protocol
again on the same day.
5914.86 I don't want to be
excessively vague there.
5916.75 What I'm trying to say is I try and adhere
5918.37 to the same schedule, but if
I get a poor night's sleep,
5920.5 I'll just simply skip
the workout the next day,
5923.41 slide the workout forward.
5924.88 There is one exception to that,
5926.14 and it's an important exception,
5927.4 which is there are times
when I've not slept well
5930.88 or I've had some
particularly stressful event
5933.37 the day before and haven't slept well,
5936.58 but I'm able to do so-called NSDR,
5938.53 non-sleep deep rest the next day.
5940.3 So there have been times
when I've only got three
5942.73 or four hours of sleep the night
5944.08 before and I'm feeling
really behind the ball
5946.42 the next morning, but I really
want to get my workout in.
5948.88 So instead what I will
do is a 10, but ideally
5951.94 in that case a 30 or even 60
minute non-sleep deep rest.
5955.63 And there's a 10 minute
5956.83 non-sleep deep breath protocol read by me.
5960.879 But it is a non-spiritual, non-mystical,
5964.93 science-supported non-sleep
deep breath protocol
5967.96 available on YouTube.
5968.793 You can simply put my
name, Huberman, put NSDR,
5971.517 and Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N,
5975.58 into YouTube and you'll find that script.
5977.23 There are other NSDR scripts
that you can find now
5979.66 on Spotify and on YouTube.
5981.64 And if you fall asleep
5982.63 during those non-sleep deep
rest scripts, that's great.
5985.21 And if you don't,
5986.05 you will also find that it
will restore your ability
5988.54 to perform mental and physical work.
5990.73 So there are times when I
haven't gotten as much sleep
5993.757 as I would like,
5994.66 or I'm feeling a bit more
stressed for whatever reason,
5997.48 and I'll do NSDR, and
then I will go train.
6000.84 And that often works
fabulously well for me.
6003.33 And then I don't have to
skip a workout entirely
6005.43 just because I didn't
get a good night's sleep.
6007.11 A lot of people ask whether
or not you should train
6009.81 fasted or fed, and this is
a very controversial area.
6012.57 I personally prefer to
do my cardiovascular work
6015.047 not having eaten anything
6018.18 in the previous 3 to 10 hours.
6021.21 And typically that's because
I wake up and I'll do
6023.64 the cardiovascular training
within about an hour
6026.19 of waking up, sometimes later,
6028.23 because my first meal
generally falls, generally,
6030.51 not always, falls around 11:00 AM.
6032.49 I don't do any kind of
formal intermittent fasting,
6035.01 but typically my meal schedule
somewhere between 11:00 a.m.
6038.82 and my last bite of
food is around 8:00 p.m.
6040.98 but I'm not super strict about that.
6042.45 I might eat in as late
as 9:00 p.m. and I might
6045.496 eat something at 10:00 a.m.
if I wake up really hungry,
6048.0 I might have something
before 11:00 a.m., I'm not
6049.8 neurotic about it.
6051.12 But in terms of training,
6052.5 I like to train fasted and that includes
6054.96 the resistance training
workouts and those come early
6056.97 in the day for me.
6057.99 And typically if I'm going to train legs
6059.73 on Monday, for instance,
which is when I train legs,
6062.303 I'll make sure that the
night before I'm ingesting
6064.86 some starch, some carbohydrate,
6066.93 like rice or pasta or
something of that sort to make
6070.013 sure that when I do that
morning leg workout,
6072.33 I have enough glycogen in
the muscles, et cetera.
6074.43 Again, nutrition is a
somewhat controversial area.
6076.71 In fact, it can evoke very
strong feelings 'cause
6079.89 I know we've got vegans
and we've got omnivores
6081.474 and we've got carnivores
and people who are keto.
6084.15 This isn't really the format for us to get
6086.01 into all of that.
6087.72 I think the rule to follow is figure
6089.91 out what optimizes your training
6091.86 for your particular training goals.
6093.87 For me, that most often
means training fasted
6096.78 and then eating pretty soon after I train.
6098.76 And if it's a high intensity
resistance training workout,
6102.622 and frankly, all of my
resistance training workouts
6104.592 are pretty high intensity,
6105.9 I'm not going to failure on
every set, but at least, say,
6108.51 about 30% of those sets
I'm going to failure.
6111.42 And the other sets I'm
working very hard nonetheless,
6114.21 well then I eat some
starches after I train
6115.98 and I also ingest some protein in the form
6117.6 of a protein drink or a meal that includes
6119.73 some protein food.
6121.2 But I don't like to eat before
I do resistance training
6124.47 or at least not within the hour or two
6126.15 before I do resistance training.
6128.25 There are exceptions to that,
6129.147 and I should say that the
same basically applies
6131.49 to endurance work.
6132.54 If I'm going to head out for a run,
6134.28 typically I don't want my
belly full of food or any
6137.28 food at all, but there
are times where I wake up
6141.0 hungry and I very much
need to eat something
6143.25 or I have something
scheduled socially like
6145.26 a breakfast and I'll have
that breakfast and then
6148.14 an hour or 90 minutes
later I'll do my workout
6150.356 because I want to make sure
that I finish the workout.
6153.48 I, again, am not neurotically
attached to training
6155.656 fasted or fed.
6157.38 For me, fasted is preferred,
but if I have to train fed,
6160.32 better to train than to not train at all.
6162.45 We haven't talked so much
about flexibility yet,
6164.55 but we did an entire episode
of the Huberman Lab podcast
6167.19 on flexibility and I
encourage you to check
6170.1 out that episode if you're interested
6172.47 in increasing your flexibility.
6173.984 But the basic takeaway from that episode
6176.82 is that if you look at what
I like to call the center
6178.95 of mass of the research,
6181.2 that is most of the studies
and what the conclusions
6183.45 of most of the quality studies point to,
6185.22 so not the exceptions,
6186.21 but the kind of general
rules that have been gleaned
6189.12 over time from multiple labs over multiple
6191.34 decades, et cetera.
6192.393 What you find is that static stretching,
6195.18 that is, holding a stretch
and in fact exhaling
6198.69 and relaxing the midsection
and torso and relaxing
6203.37 into the stretch as opposed
to staying full of air
6205.496 and tense, but mentally
and physically relaxing
6209.04 into the stretch, but
not stretching maximally,
6213.03 that is not extending as
far as you possibly can go,
6216.09 but more like 60% or even less.
6218.55 And then holding those
static stretches for anywhere
6222.24 from 30 to 60 seconds and then repeating,
6225.15 doing that two or three
times throughout the week
6227.22 for multiple muscle groups,
6228.21 so it could be for your quadriceps,
6229.59 could be for hamstrings, for your lats.
6231.78 There are protocols out there.
6232.77 In fact, we have a newsletter
that is focused entirely
6235.913 on protocols for
flexibility and stretching.
6238.2 You can find that again
by going hubermanlab.com.
6240.69 You don't even need to
sign up for the newsletter,
6242.34 although we invite you to if you like,
6244.2 but you can simply go there,
6245.331 scroll down to the
flexibility newsletter and all
6248.52 the protocols are there
for each of the muscle
6250.62 groups, et cetera.
6251.79 But what I typically try
and do is some stretching
6254.04 in the evening, because
I train in the morning,
6256.52 as I'm perhaps getting ready
for bed or if the TV is on,
6261.93 which in our house doesn't typically go
6264.36 on because we don't
have a TV, but of course
6266.34 there are computers and people are
6268.11 on their computers, et cetera.
6269.422 Well, I'll try and do some
stretching while I do that.
6272.01 I also have a standing desk,
so during the day at work,
6274.74 regardless of whether or not
I train that morning or not,
6277.17 or I'm going to train in the afternoon,
6278.34 I'll try and do some static
stretching for my hamstrings,
6280.83 my quads, my lats, my shoulders, my back,
6283.484 really doesn't take much
time and I really try
6285.57 to space that out
throughout the week, which,
6288.48 if you look at the peer reviewed research,
6290.34 matches well to what's
known to be most effective,
6292.59 which are going to be short,
6293.67 repeated sessions ideally every day.
6295.89 But truth told, I fail.
I categorically fail.
6300.21 I was about to think of
whether or not I ever
6301.8 stretch every day.
6302.79 I fail to do it every day,
6303.84 but I get about three or
so stretching sessions
6306.667 in per week.
6307.68 And again, it's just static hold,
6309.12 trying to really relax into the stretch.
6311.61 Now the relax into the
stretch is something
6314.22 has been talked about
in martial arts circles
6317.22 and Pavel Tsatsouline has an
excellent book on stretching,
6319.68 we can provide a link to
that, talks about this,
6322.47 has a lot to do with relaxation
of the nervous system
6325.35 and the way that the
nerves innervate muscles
6327.0 and allow for stretch, if you will.
6329.01 Also, the way that the
tendons and ligaments
6330.6 are innervated by nerves.
6333.18 The converse is also true.
6334.62 And here, again, this is
a principle that Pavel has
6336.733 put forth, I believe he
calls it irradiation,
6339.93 meaning irradiating out or
emanating out from a source,
6343.56 which is that while exhaling
and relaxing the torso,
6347.192 the midsection, some
people call it the core,
6351.09 although some people don't like that term,
6353.55 can facilitate relaxation and stretching
6356.79 through a larger range of motion.
6358.53 So too can contracting
the core, the midsection,
6363.0 or gripping very tightly with the fist can
6366.15 facilitate muscular
contraction because of the way
6368.82 that the nervous system heavily,
6371.19 we can even say over-represents
the fists in the brain.
6375.45 And so how would you apply
6376.71 this to your overall
foundational fitness protocol?
6379.347 Well, it turns out that, let's say,
6381.15 you're doing a movement that
involves one limb moving
6385.59 and then the other, let's
say it's bicep curls,
6387.51 just for sake of example,
6388.95 turns out that you will
actually be stronger
6391.47 in moving that dumbbell
with the arm that happens
6394.443 to be moving if you grip
the handle very tightly,
6398.76 but also grip the handle of the opposite
6401.37 dumbbell very tightly.
6402.96 Now that said, in between sets,
6404.67 I encourage you to do the opposite.
6406.32 To try and completely
relax in between sets,
6408.18 combine that with the physiological sigh,
6409.83 and then when the set,
the next set commences,
6413.16 employ that very strong grip, both, again,
6415.47 of the weight that's moving and the weight
6417.138 that at that moment might be stationary
6419.34 or in isometric position.
6421.2 So the nervous system, of course,
6423.51 is what controls muscles and that operates
6426.57 in both directions.
6427.403 If you want to relax,
try and use long exhales,
6429.87 maybe even physiological
sighs and really concentrate
6432.48 on mentally and physically relaxing,
6434.01 in particular your core and your fists.
6437.19 And if you want to generate force, right,
6439.74 you want to move a heavy
barbell or dumbbell,
6442.44 you want to do a chin up
with the maximal force,
6444.72 that's when you can employ the opposite,
6446.04 which would be to grip
the bar or dumbbell,
6447.75 et cetera, very tightly.
6449.22 And you want to contract
your core or even fill
6452.46 your body with air as a, say,
6453.96 plug all the leaks, et cetera.
6455.82 So this gets into kind
of form and movement,
6457.758 which is an extensive
near infinite landscape
6461.34 of discussion, again, that we
don't have time to go into.
6463.71 I just want to mention those
two nervous system related tips
6466.38 because I suppose as a
neuroscientist, they appeal
6468.78 to me because they're
grounded in fundamental
6470.43 principles of how the nervous
system innervates muscle.
6472.77 And I know that they will benefit
6474.18 you the first time you
use them and every time.
6476.43 Speaking of grip and
nervous system and fitness
6478.38 and longevity, Dr. Peter
Attia, who is a medical doctor,
6481.176 was a guest on the Huberman
Lab podcast and provided
6483.75 an enormous wealth of information
on that podcast episode.
6486.42 I really encourage you to check
it out when you have time.
6489.3 And of course has his
own spectacular podcast,
6491.61 The Drive with Peter Attia.
6493.29 Peter, Dr. Attia, I should say,
6496.56 often talks about certain
movements or exercises
6499.597 that you should perform not
just to improve your fitness,
6502.11 but also to touch into or
measure how fit you are
6505.56 and how well you are
progressing toward a long
6507.777 lifespan and healthspan.
6509.46 And one of those includes
the ability to hang
6511.92 from a bar for a minute or longer.
6514.08 And there are a number
of different expectations
6517.68 that one can have of how
long they should be able
6520.2 to hang from a bar depending on their age
6522.15 and their fitness level, et cetera.
6523.5 Please check out Dr. Attia's podcast
6525.96 and his various social
media sites to get more
6528.15 information on that.
6529.26 But what I can tell you is
that if you're going to hang
6531.36 from a bar and you want to
hang from that bar as long
6534.09 as possible, which turns
out to be a interesting
6536.52 and important metric of your health,
6539.01 then gripping the bar very
tightly will actually help.
6541.53 Earlier we talked about
whether or not to train
6543.6 if you're sleep deprived
and how to recover
6546.39 from what I would say is
moderate sleep deprivation
6549.69 by doing NSDR as opposed
to total sleep deprivation
6552.87 like being up all night or having a truly
6554.52 miserable night, which case,
6556.173 I think you should just
skip training the next day
6558.75 and slide it forward.
6559.89 Now, a similar issue
comes up from time to time
6562.74 where people wonder whether
or not they should train
6565.44 or not if they're sick.
6567.24 And here there's all
sorts of crazy gym lore
6571.77 and sport specific lore.
6573.546 For instance, I used to hear this,
6576.39 when I ran cross country,
6577.35 there was this adage
that if the symptoms were
6582.78 from the neck up, you could still train.
6585.15 That is if you were really
congested and you had
6586.86 a headache, you could still run.
6588.66 Whereas if it was in your
chest and in your lungs
6590.73 you couldn't run.
6591.563 I don't think there's any data whatsoever
6593.82 to support whether or not that's true
6596.07 or whether it's not true.
6598.028 For myself, and because
my general goal is to be
6603.951 training and fit over time,
6606.33 but also to include general
health in the fitness equation,
6610.41 that is to not be sick or chronically sick
6612.69 and certainly not to
get other people sick.
6615.33 If I have a little tiny sniffle,
6617.97 like I think I might be
getting sick, even then,
6621.21 I'm a little cautious in
the sense that I'm not going
6623.61 to do my typical workout.
6625.8 I might stop at about 15 minutes earlier.
6628.47 And I would do that not by
neglecting any body parts
6631.77 or anything of that sort.
6632.67 If it's a weight training workout,
6634.824 by simply reducing the
total number of sets,
6636.75 I probably wouldn't do any
sets to failure, if I did,
6639.72 I might reduce the total
number or percentage of sets
6642.21 to failure from about 30%
of sets to maybe closer
6645.36 to 10% of sets, something like that.
6647.721 And if it was endurance work,
6649.32 I might throttle back by 10 or 20%.
6651.84 And I will shorten the total
duration of the workout.
6654.33 And I often find that
because of the known, yes,
6658.38 peer reviewed known immune
system enhancing effects
6661.26 of exercise, sometimes
that alone will allow me
6664.006 to avoid getting sick.
6666.06 But of course I'm also
careful to get home,
6668.13 take a hot shower, not stress myself out,
6670.89 if I can avoid getting
myself stressed out and focus
6673.44 on sleep, NSDR, other forms of recovery,
6675.87 good nutrition, et cetera.
6677.7 If however, I have a real sniffle, a cold,
6679.783 I'm not feeling well or
I think I might be coming
6682.95 down with a flu,
6683.783 I absolutely do not train
and I don't get back
6685.265 into training of any kind
until I'm completely recovered.
6689.73 So what I'm basically saying is that, no,
6691.89 I don't believe you should
train if you're sick.
6694.44 And perhaps equally importantly,
6697.23 when you come back from
a layoff of any kind,
6699.72 whether or not because of
illness or for whatever reason,
6703.47 I do believe that because
your body is a bit untrained,
6706.093 it's not ideal to jump
right back into maximal
6708.87 training and to take one,
6710.79 maybe two weeks of ramping
up to the full duration
6714.27 and intensity of workouts
that then I would continue on
6716.73 going for however many
cycles I can complete
6721.11 before I hit another
sickness or I hit another gap
6725.31 in my schedule due to family obligations
6727.71 or other obligations, et cetera.
6729.09 So we've covered a lot
of tools and protocols
6731.43 and variables related to fitness,
6733.65 but we have by no means
covered all the available
6736.11 tools and protocols and variables.
6738.75 Before we wrap up, I do
want to emphasize one tool.
6741.75 It's a very easy, in fact, zero cost,
6744.66 very low time commitment tool.
6747.21 And this was one that was provided, again,
6749.16 by Dr. Andy Galpin when he was
on the Huberman Lab podcast.
6752.61 And it's a tool that there
is excellent research
6755.13 to support the effectiveness of,
6757.8 and that I do believe
should come at the end
6760.35 of every training session.
6762.09 And that's to do three to five minutes
6765.03 of deliberately slowed breathing.
6767.67 It sounds so simple,
6769.05 three to five minutes of
deliberately slowed breathing.
6772.32 So this could be while
you're in the shower
6774.3 or when you arrive at your car,
6776.04 you might sit in your car quietly and do
6777.6 that if you have time or maybe
6778.83 even while you're driving back to,
6781.38 or onto your next destination,
6784.71 just to really slow down your breathing,
6786.84 to really look at the
recovery period that has
6789.93 to follow each training session.
6791.73 And of course, during
which the adaptations,
6793.65 the changes that make you
more fit than you were
6796.32 going into the exercise occur.
6798.96 And that three to five
minutes of deliberately
6801.15 slowed breathing has been
shown in Andy's group
6803.88 and in related experiments,
6806.01 not exactly the same,
but related experiments
6807.96 in our laboratory, in other laboratories,
6810.12 to really so-called
downshift the nervous system
6812.73 and really set you up for
maximal recovery, rapid recovery,
6817.2 and allow you to lean into
the next training session
6819.57 with full intensity
6820.59 when that training session
eventually arrives.
6822.51 So it's a very simple tool,
6824.01 but a very potent tool
for your overall fitness.
6827.4 So thank you for joining
me for this discussion
6829.35 of what I'm calling a
foundational, or yes,
6832.56 we could even get bold and call
6833.91 it an optimal fitness protocol.
6835.38 Although the word optimal is a tricky one.
6837.87 There's no real optimal fitness protocol.
6840.0 And today what I've
really tried to focus on
6842.01 is this foundational protocol
because it does allow
6845.7 you to check off most,
6847.56 if not all the boxes related
to strength, endurance,
6852.42 hypertrophy, speed, power, flexibility.
6857.76 It will also teach you how
to regulate your nervous
6859.5 system up and down.
6860.67 That is to ramp up and focus,
mind muscle link, et cetera,
6864.63 and then quickly calm
down, physiological sighs,
6867.24 three to five minute decompress breathing
6868.77 at the end of training, et cetera.
6870.54 Really, even though I
talked about the protocol
6872.52 that I follow, and again,
6874.05 that we will provide as a
newsletter at hubermanlab.com
6876.979 if you want to look at it in more detail,
6879.36 even though we talked about it
in the context of what I do,
6882.15 again, I really want to
emphasize that this protocol
6885.36 and the description of
this protocol and all
6887.43 its variables is really for
you and for you to tailor
6890.64 to your specific needs.
6891.81 So please, take the
protocol into consideration,
6895.38 but do not treat it as holy,
6896.67 treat it as a starting point
from which you can adapt it
6899.82 to your specific fitness needs.

6934.14 Not so much today,
6934.973 but in many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab podcast,
6937.41 we talk about supplements.
6938.7 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
6940.92 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them
6942.96 for things like enhancing sleep and focus
6944.91 and hormone optimization.
6946.59 The Huberman Lab podcast has partnered
6948.03 with Momentous Supplements.
6949.23 If you like to see the supplements
6950.31 of the Huberman Lab podcast has partnered
6951.81 with Momentous on, you
can go to livemomentous,
6954.27 spelled O-U-S, so
livemomentous.com/huberman.
6957.75 And there you'll see a
number of the supplements
6959.7 that we talk about
regularly on the podcast.
6961.62 I should just mention that
catalog of supplements
6963.6 is constantly being updated.
6965.19 As mentioned at the
beginning of today's episode,
6966.99 the Huberman Lab podcast has now launched
