0.053 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.3 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.93 for everyday life.
6.131 [energetic music]
9.53 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.5 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.35 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.42 Today, we are going to
talk all about dopamine
17.63 and what drives you to do
the things that you do.
21.19 We're going to talk about
motivation and desire and craving,
25.53 but also how dopamine
relates to satisfaction
29.21 and our feelings of wellbeing.
31.11 And of course, any
discussion about dopamine
33.63 has to include a discussion
about the potential
36.36 for dopamine induced addiction.
39.48 Indeed, dopamine lies at
the heart of addiction
42.03 to all things.
43.66 But today we are mainly going to focus on,
46.0 how what we do and how we do it,
49.37 and how we conceptualize those things
52.21 leads to changes in this amazing molecule
55.25 in our brain and bodies
that we call dopamine.
58.2 I'm going to teach you what
dopamine is and what it is not.
61.66 There are a lot of myths
about the molecule dopamine.
64.07 We often hear about
so-called dopamine hits.
66.58 Today, we are going to
dispel many common myths
68.87 about dopamine,
70.03 and we are going to talk about
how dopamine actually works.
73.21 We're going to discuss
the biology of dopamine,
75.82 the psychology.
76.86 We will discuss some neural circuits
78.72 and a really exciting
aspect of dopamine biology
81.64 or so-called dopamine schedules.
83.91 In other words, we are going to discuss
85.33 how things like food, drugs,
caffeine, pornography,
88.97 even some plant-based compounds can change
91.84 our baseline levels of
dopamine and in doing so,
94.91 they change how much dopamine
we are capable of experiencing
98.72 from what could be very satisfying events,
102.07 or events that make us feel not so good
104.22 because of things that
we did or took prior.
107.1 So I promise you it's going
to be a vast discussion,
110.86 but I will structure it for you,
112.38 and you'll come away
with a deep understanding
114.63 of really what drives you.
116.13 You will also come away
with a lot of tools,
118.58 how to leverage dopamine so
that you can sustain energy,
122.33 drive and motivation for the things
123.8 that are important to you
over long periods of time.
126.72 Before we dive into the
meat of today's discussion,
129.75 I'd like to share with
you a fascinating result
133.23 that really underscores what dopamine
135.16 is capable of in our brains and bodies,
137.16 and underscores the fact
that just through behaviors,
140.97 no drugs, nothing of that sort,
142.9 just through behaviors,
144.07 we can achieve terrifically
high increases in dopamine
148.0 that are very long and
sustained in ways that serve us.
152.25 This is a result that was published
153.44 in the European Journal of Physiology.
155.54 I'll go into it in more detail later,
157.18 but essentially what it involved
is having human subjects
160.75 get into water of different temperatures.
163.92 So it was warm water,
165.49 moderately cool water
and cold, cold water.
169.24 Had them stay in that
water for up to an hour,
172.16 and they measured by way of blood draw
175.04 things like cortisol,
norepinephrine and dopamine.
180.09 What was fascinating is
that cold water exposure
183.57 led to very rapid
increases in norepinephrine
187.27 and epinephrine,
188.41 which is also just called adrenaline.
190.72 It also led to increases in dopamine.
193.5 And these increases in
dopamine were very significant.
196.89 They kicked in around 10 or
15 minutes after submersion
200.27 into the cold water.
201.47 And I should mention the
head wasn't below water
203.14 is just up to the neck.
204.9 And the dopamine release continued to rise
209.52 and rise and rise,
210.51 and eventually reached
250% above baseline.
213.83 Now, what was interesting
is after subjects got out
216.93 of this cold water,
218.4 that dopamine increase was sustained.
220.94 And I know nowadays many
people are interested
223.02 in using cold water therapy as
a way to increase metabolism
227.05 and fat loss,
228.28 but also to improve sense of well-being,
231.44 improve cognition,
improve clarity of mind.
234.66 There's something really
special about this very alert,
237.88 but calm state of mind
239.34 that seems to be the one that's optimal
241.5 for pretty much everything except sleep,
244.01 but for all aspects of work
and for social engagement
247.65 and for sport that highly alert,
250.02 but calm state of mind
really is the sweet spot
253.37 that I believe most of
us would like to achieve.
255.57 And this cold water
exposure done correctly
258.49 really can help people
achieve that state of mind
261.44 through these increases in dopamine
263.33 that lasts a very long time.
265.15 So I will later detail the
specifics of that study,
268.47 what it entailed in terms of how long,
271.03 the variations, the different
subjects experienced,
273.73 as well as how to limit the
amount of stress hormone,
276.33 cortisol, that's released as a consequence
278.81 of the cold water.
280.23 And we will also talk about
compounds, supplements
282.62 that people can take in order to increase
284.83 their levels of dopamine
should they choose.
287.53 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
289.15 that this podcast is
separate from my teaching
291.06 and research roles at Stanford.
292.86 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
295.1 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
297.89 and science related tools
to the general public.
300.62 In keeping with that theme,
301.76 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
304.7 Our first sponsor is Roka.
306.85 Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
308.73 that are of the absolute highest quality.
311.29 I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system.
313.437 And I can tell you that the visual system
314.88 has to go through a lot of work
316.09 in order to main clarity of what you see
318.79 when there are shadows,
320.2 when you go into different
types of indoor lighting,
322.04 and so on.
322.873 And a lot of glasses don't work well
324.5 because you put them on,
326.17 and then you're in bright
light and you can see fine,
328.37 but then you move into a shadow
329.47 and then you have to take them
off and they don't adjust,
331.48 or they don't adjust quickly enough.
333.23 With Roka their eyeglasses
and sunglasses are designed
336.16 with the visual system biology in mind.
338.8 So you always see things
with perfect clarity.
340.72 The glasses are also terrific
342.03 because they're very lightweight,
343.36 and they won't slip off your
face if you're exercising,
345.72 if you're running or biking.
346.76 In fact, they were
designed for the purpose
348.44 of being able to be worn
while you're engaging
350.87 in those sorts of activities
or simply working at your desk.
353.86 I happen to wear readers at night
355.84 or when I drive or when I work,
357.8 and I love their sunglasses
cause I can wear them anywhere.
360.73 And also the aesthetics of
their sunglasses and eyeglasses
363.63 are terrific.
364.463 Unlike a lot of other performance glasses
366.2 that frankly make people
look like cyborgs.
368.61 The aesthetics on Roka's
are really terrific.
370.43 You could wear them
anywhere you'd like to go.
372.62 If you'd like to try Roka glasses,

385.5 Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
389.197 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
391.39 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
393.78 to help you better understand your body
395.8 and help you reach your health goals.
397.75 I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done.
400.8 And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,
403.06 you can also analyze your DNA to see
405.38 what you ought to be
doing for your immediate
407.84 and long-term health.
409.35 We hear a lot these
days about optimization,
411.2 optimizing hormones,
optimizing your metabolism,
413.4 optimizing this, optimizing that,
414.84 but unless you know the
measurements of metabolic factors,
417.89 hormones and other things that
are in your blood and DNA,
421.4 you don't know what to optimize.
423.15 With InsideTracker it makes
all of that very easy.
425.94 They can come to your house to
take the blood and DNA test,
428.17 or you can go to a nearby clinic.
430.26 They send you the information
and you take those results.
433.1 And unlike a lot of laboratories
doing blood work out there
436.36 and DNA tests,
437.48 they have a simple platform, a dashboard
439.61 that walks you through your results
441.56 and helps you identify
what sorts of nutritional
444.01 or behavioral or other types of practices
446.33 you might want to
incorporate into your life
448.04 in order to positively
impact your immediate
450.59 and long-term health.
451.93 It's a very easy system to use,
453.62 and you will gain a ton of information
455.21 simply by doing that test.
456.37 Whether or not you end up making changes
457.77 to what you're doing or not.

470.04 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.
472.8 Headspace is a meditation app
backed by 25 published studies
476.26 and has over 600,005 star reviews.
479.53 I've been meditating for a long time,
481.13 but I confess sometimes I meditate
483.73 and sometimes I'm very
inconsistent about my meditation.
487.03 Ideally, I would meditate
every day for 20 or 30 minutes,
490.55 but what I found over the years is that,
492.63 I'll start a meditation practice
494.14 and then as life gets
more stressful or busier,
497.64 which is exactly when I
need to meditate more,
499.7 I tend to meditate less often.
502.02 Switching over to Headspace
as a meditation app
504.14 really helped me stay consistent
505.72 with my meditation practice.
507.3 And that's because they have
a huge range of meditations
510.35 to select from.
511.183 Some are short, some are longer.
513.22 And in general, I try and
get 20 minutes of meditation
516.2 in every day,
517.033 but some days it's just five minutes
518.32 and they have some terrific
just five minute meditations.
520.94 The science says that even
a five minute meditation
523.58 can be beneficial for
different aspects of our brain
526.45 and body.
527.8 If you want to try Headspace,
528.87 you can go to
www.headspace.com/specialoffer.
532.02 And if you do that,
532.87 you'll get one month as a free trial
534.64 with full library of meditations
537.22 that you can use in any situation.
540.03 This is the best deal offered
by Headspace right now.
542.18 So if you're interested,
543.31 go to www.headspace.com/specialoffer
545.6 to get one free one month
trial with Headspace's
548.78 full library of meditations.
550.83 I'd like to announce that there's an event
552.41 that some of you may find very useful.
554.74 This is an event put on by Logitech
556.73 that I will be speaking at.
558.41 It's called Rethink Education,
560.7 the Biology of Learning
Reimagining Learning
563.4 through Neuroscience.
564.36 And at this event, I will be speaking,
566.21 there will be other speakers as well,
567.82 and I will be talking
about neuroplasticity
570.13 and its applications for
teaching and for learning.
573.17 I will describe what I call
the plasticity super protocol
576.04 that incorporates all of what
we know about rapid learning,
579.86 efficient learning and the
best ways to teach and learn.
582.89 It's geared towards
educators of all kinds.
585.2 It is zero cost.
586.66 So please feel free to sign up.
588.5 The event is September 30th,
2021 at 3:00 p.m Eastern.
594.07 You can find the registration
link in the caption
596.84 for this episode.
598.3 So let's talk about dopamine.
600.03 Most people have heard of dopamine,
601.6 and we hear all the time
now about dopamine hits.
604.31 But actually there's no such
thing as a dopamine hit.
608.3 And actually the way that
your body uses dopamine
612.26 is to have a baseline level of dopamine.
615.58 Meaning an amount of
dopamine that's circulating
617.93 in your brain and body all the time.
620.37 And that turns out to be
important for how you feel
622.94 generally, whether or not
you're in a good mood,
624.96 motivated, et cetera.
626.79 And you also can experience
peaks in dopamine
629.89 above baseline.
631.54 Now, this has a very specific name
633.32 in the neurobiology literature,
634.973 so-called tonic and phasic
release of dopamine.
639.4 And I'll explain what that
means in a couple of minutes.
641.46 But if you remember nothing
else from this episode,
644.42 please remember this,
646.08 that when you experience
something or you crave something
650.42 really desirable, really exciting
to you, very pleasurable.
655.34 What happens afterwards
is your baseline level
658.43 of dopamine drops.
660.54 Okay?
661.373 So these peaks in dopamine,
663.36 they influence how much dopamine
665.15 will generally be circulating afterward.
667.42 And you might think, oh, a big
peak in dopamine after that,
670.23 I'm going to feel even better
671.36 because I just had this great event.
673.43 Not the case.
674.36 What actually happens is
that your baseline level
677.01 of dopamine drops.
678.26 And I will explain the
precise mechanism for that.
681.21 Okay?
682.043 In the neuroscience literature,
683.4 we refer to this as tonic and
phasic release of dopamine.
689.2 Tonic being the low level baseline
692.29 that's always there circulating,
694.95 released into your brain all the time.
697.25 And then phasic these peaks
that ride above that baseline.
701.47 And those two things interact.
703.2 And this is really important.
705.0 I'm going to teach you the
underlying neurobiology,
706.53 but even if you have no
background in biology,
708.45 I promise to make it all clear.
709.7 I'll explain the terms and what they mean.
712.06 And I'm excited to teach
you about dopamine,
714.32 because dopamine has everything
to do with how you feel
717.16 right now as you're listening to this,
718.88 it has everything to do
with how you will feel
721.34 an hour from now,
722.64 has everything to do with
your level of motivation
724.92 and your level of desire,
726.35 and your willingness
to push through effort.
728.9 If ever you've interacted with somebody
730.93 who just doesn't seem to have
any drive they've given up,
734.68 or if you've interacted with somebody
736.16 who seems to have
endless drive and energy,
738.92 what you are looking at there
in those two circumstances
742.05 is without question a difference
745.28 in the level of dopamine
circulating in their system.
748.97 There will be other factors too,
750.87 but the level of dopamine
is the primary determinant
754.86 of how motivated we
are, how excited we are,
757.94 how outward facing we are
and how willing we are,
760.64 to lean into life and pursue things.
763.19 Dopamine is what we call a neuromodulator.
765.71 Neuromodulators are different
than neurotransmitters.
768.09 Neurotransmitters are
involved in the dialogue
770.64 between neurons nerve cells.
772.72 And neurotransmitters tend to
mediate local communication.
775.91 Just imagine two people talking
to one another at a concert,
779.27 that communication
between them is analogous
781.86 to the communication carried
out by neurotransmitters,
785.17 whereas neuromodulators
influence the communication
788.59 of many neurons.
789.64 Imagine a bunch of people dancing
791.27 where it's a coordinated
dance involving 10 or 20
793.75 or hundreds of people.
795.54 Neuromodulators are
coordinating that dance.
798.47 In the nervous system
what this means is that,
800.43 dopamine release changes the probability
803.28 that certain neural
circuits will be active
806.32 and that other neural
circuits will be inactive.
809.61 Okay?
810.443 So it modulates a bunch
of things all at once,
813.08 and that's why it's so
powerful at shifting
815.0 not just our levels of energy,
816.29 but also our mindset,
817.99 also our feelings of
whether or not we can,
821.76 or cannot accomplish something.
824.4 So how does dopamine
work and what does it do?
826.75 Well, first of all, it is not
just responsible for pleasure,
830.13 it is responsible for
motivation and drive.
832.55 Primarily, at the psychological level,
834.56 also for craving.
835.96 Those three things are sort of the same.
837.61 Motivation, drive and craving.
839.24 It also controls time perception,
841.2 and we will get deep into how dopamine
843.97 can modulate time perception,
845.57 and how important it is
that everybody be able
849.21 to access increases in dopamine
at different timescales.
853.54 This turns out to be important
to not end up addicted
856.1 to substances,
856.933 but it also turns out to be
very important to sustain effort
860.28 and be a happy person
over long periods of time.
862.44 Which I think most everybody wants.
864.74 It certainly is adaptive in
life to be able to do that.
867.93 Dopamine is also vitally
important for movement.
871.3 I'll explain the neural circuits
for dopamine and mindset,
875.02 and dopamine in movement in a moment,
877.57 but in diseases like Parkinson's
or Lewy bodies dementia,
883.4 which is similar to
Parkinson's in many ways.
885.453 There's a depletion or
death of dopamine neurons
888.27 at a particular location in the brain
890.2 which leads to shaky movements,
893.26 challenges and speaking,
894.46 challenges in particular
in initiating movement.
897.62 And because dopamine is depleted elsewhere
900.63 to people with Parkinson's and Lew's bod,
904.01 excuse me, Lewy body dementia
also experience drops
907.34 in motivation and affect, meaning mood.
910.18 They tend to get depressed and so on.
912.82 When those people are properly treated,
915.42 they can, not always,
917.34 but they can recover some
fluidity of movement,
920.39 some ability to initiate movement.
922.16 And almost without question,
924.01 those people feel better psychologically,
926.86 not just because they can move,
928.07 but also because dopamine
impacts mood and motivation.
931.68 So what are the underlying
neural circuits?
935.43 For those of you that are
not interested in biology
938.06 and specific nomenclature,
939.13 you can tune out now if you want,
940.9 but it's actually pretty straightforward.
942.64 You have two main neural
circuits in the brain
945.63 that dopamine uses in order
to exert all its effects.
950.76 The first one is a pathway
that goes from this area
954.61 in the what's called
the ventral tegmentum.
957.095 That's a fancy, but
ventral just means bottom,
959.01 and tegmentum actually means floor.
961.09 So it's at the bottom of the brain,
962.88 and it's the ventral part of the floor.
964.58 So it's really low in
the back of the brain,
966.36 the ventral tegmentum.
967.82 And it goes from the ventral tegmentum
971.57 to what's called the ventral striatum
974.15 and the prefrontal cortex.
975.4 Now, that's a lot of language,
976.55 but basically what we call this is the,
978.76 mesocorticolimbic pathway.
980.31 This is the pathway by which
dopamine influences motivation,
985.28 drive and craving.
987.26 It involves structures that
some of you may have heard
989.15 of before.
989.983 Things like nucleus accumbens
and the prefrontal cortex.
992.94 This is the pathway that
really gets disrupted
995.65 in addictions where in
particular drugs that influence
1000.21 the release of dopamine like
cocaine and methamphetamine.
1002.65 We'll talk about those drugs today.
1004.1 They tap into this pathway.
1005.61 But if you are pursuing a partner,
1009.52 a boyfriend or girlfriend,
1010.46 if you're pursuing a degree in school,
1012.43 if you're pursuing a
finish line in a race,
1014.83 you are tapping into this so-called
1016.3 mesecorticolimbic pathway.
1018.38 This is the classic reward
pathway in all mammals.
1023.5 The other pathway emerges
from an area in the brain
1026.87 called the substantia nigra.
1028.72 So-called because the cells
in that area are dark,
1033.61 and the substantia nigra
connects to an area of the brain
1037.09 called the dorsal striatum.
1038.45 This is not surprisingly called
the nigrostriatal pathway.
1042.53 For those of you who have
never done any neuroanatomy,
1044.53 I'm going to teach you a
little trick right now.
1046.37 Everything in neuroanatomy,
1047.76 the first part of a word tells
you where the neurons are.
1052.46 And then the second part tells you
1053.61 where they are connecting to.
1054.79 So when I say nigropstriatal pathway,
1057.33 it means that the neurons
are in substantial nigra
1059.4 and they connect to the
striatum, nigrostriatal pathway.
1062.56 So while it's a lot of language
there, some logic there.
1065.52 Okay?
1066.353 So we've got these two pathways.
1067.7 One, mainly for movement, right?
1069.9 This is the substantia
nigra to dorsal striatum.
1073.06 And we've got this other pathway,
1075.67 the so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway,
1077.33 that's for reward,
reinforcement and motivation.
1080.983 I want you to remember that
there are two pathways.
1083.77 If you don't remember the
two pathways in detail,
1085.98 that's fine.
1086.813 But please remember that
there are two pathways,
1088.78 because that turns out
to be important later.
1090.64 Now, the other thing to
understand about dopamine is that,
1093.72 the way that dopamine is
released in the brain and body
1097.92 can differ.
1099.51 Meaning it can be very local,
1102.33 or it can be more broad.
1104.7 Now, most of you have
probably heard of synapses.
1107.51 Synapses are the little
spaces between neurons,
1110.65 and basically neurons
nerve cells communicate
1112.76 with one another by making
each other electrically active,
1116.35 or by making each other
less electrically active.
1119.84 So here's how this works.
1120.673 You can imagine one nerve
cell and another nerve cell
1123.14 with a little gap between them,
1124.24 a little synapse.
1125.68 And the way that one nerve cell causes
1128.16 the next nerve cell to fire.
1129.9 What we call fire really means
to become electrically active
1132.64 is that it vomits out
these little packets,
1135.52 what we call vesicles.
1136.47 They're little bubbles
filled with a chemical,
1138.93 when that chemical enters the synapse,
1141.51 it some of it docks or
parks on the other side,
1144.99 in the other neuron.
1146.35 And by virtue of
electrical changes in the,
1150.17 what we call the postsynaptic neuron,
1152.42 that chemical will make that
neuron more electrically active
1155.61 or less electrically active.
1157.58 Dopamine can do that like
any other neurotransmitter
1160.99 or neuromodulator.
1162.49 So it can have one neuron
influence another neuron.
1165.99 But dopamine can also engage
1168.28 in what's called a volume metric release.
1170.49 Volumetric release is like a
giant vomit that gets out to 50
1175.16 or a hundred or even thousands of cells.
1177.85 So there's local release what
we call synaptic release,
1180.51 and then there's volumetric release.
1182.01 So volumetric release is like
dumping all this dopamine out
1184.99 into the system.
1186.31 So dopamine is incredible
because it can change the way
1190.22 that our neural circuits
work at a local scale
1192.9 and at a very broad scale.
1194.82 And for those of you that
are only interested in tools,
1197.33 like how do I get more dopamine?
1199.15 Let me tell you this
part is really important
1201.78 because if you were to
take a drug or supplement
1205.65 that increases your level of dopamine,
1207.63 you are influencing both the
local release of dopamine
1211.73 and volumetric release.
1213.89 This relates back to
the baseline of dopamine
1216.19 and the big peak above baseline.
1218.95 And that turns out to be important.
1220.52 And I'll just allude
to why it's important.
1223.24 Many drugs and indeed many supplements
1226.74 that increase dopamine will
actually make it harder
1231.11 for you to sustain dopamine release
1233.11 over long periods of time.
1234.83 And to achieve those peaks
that most of us are craving
1238.0 when we are in pursuit of things.
1239.71 Why?
1240.67 Because if you get both
volume metric release,
1243.56 the dumping out of dopamine everywhere,
1245.39 and you're getting local release,
1247.26 what it means is that the
difference between the peak
1249.367 and baseline is likely to be smaller.
1252.87 And this is very important,
1255.12 how satisfying or exciting or pleasureful
1258.75 a given experience is,
1260.75 doesn't just depend on
the height of that peak,
1263.92 it depends on the height
of that peak relative
1266.92 to the baseline.
1268.11 So if you increase the baseline
and you increase the peak,
1272.41 you're not going to achieve
more and more pleasure
1274.83 from things.
1275.8 I'll talk about how to
leverage this information
1278.89 in a little bit,
1280.17 but just increasing your dopamine.
1282.84 Yes, it will make you
excited for all things.
1285.26 It will make you feel very motivated,
1287.0 but it will also make that
motivation very short-lived.
1291.27 So there's a better way
to increase your dopamine.
1294.75 There's a better way to optimize
1296.3 this peak to baseline ratio.
1298.3 For now what we've talked about
is two main neural circuits,
1301.18 one for movement,
1302.05 and one for motivation
and craving with dopamine.
1305.08 And we've talked about two
main modes of communication
1307.91 between neurons with dopamine.
1310.5 One is this local synaptic release.
1313.84 One is more volume metric release.
1316.54 And in the back of your mind,
1317.63 you can relate this back to,
1318.88 again, this baseline versus
peaks above baseline.
1322.27 So that's a description
of what we would call
1324.02 the spatial effects or the
spatial aspects of dopamine.
1328.96 I said this connects to that,
1330.28 that connects to this.
1331.15 You can get local or more
broad volumetric release.
1333.96 What about the duration of release
1336.17 or the duration of action for dopamine?
1339.07 Well, dopamine is unique
among chemicals in the brain,
1343.33 because dopamine unlike a
lot of chemicals in the brain
1346.66 works through what are called
G protein-coupled receptors.
1349.52 And for those of you that
are about to pass out
1351.15 from the amount of detail,
1352.04 just hang in there with me.
1353.01 It's really not complicated.
1355.02 There are two ways that
neurons can communicate
1358.28 or mainly two ways.
1359.53 There are third and fourth,
1360.7 but mostly neurons
communicate by two modes.
1365.65 One, are what we call
fast electrical synapses
1369.02 ionotropic conduction.
1370.95 All right?
1371.783 You don't need to know what that means,
1372.616 but basically one neuron
activates another neuron
1376.35 and little holes open up in that neuron,
1378.92 and ions rush in.
1380.74 Sodium is the main ion salt
1383.85 by which one neuron influences
the electrical activity
1386.74 of another neuron because
sodium ions contain a charge.
1390.02 Okay?
1391.041 There are other things like
chloride and potassium.
1392.49 If you're interested in looking this up,
1393.72 just look up ionic conductances
in the action potential,
1397.22 or I could do a post on it some time
1398.73 and we could go into detail.
1400.57 But just understand that when neurons
1402.03 want to influence each other,
1403.44 they can do it by way of this
fast ionotropic conduction.
1406.56 This is a really quick way for one neuron
1409.63 to influence the next.
1411.95 Dopamine doesn't communicate that way.
1414.27 Dopamine is slower.
1415.81 It works through what are
called G protein-coupled
1417.63 receptors.
1418.56 So what happens is dopamine is released
1420.62 in these little vesicles
that I've mentioned before,
1422.6 get vomited out into the synapse.
1425.08 Some of that dopamine will bind
1427.34 to the so-called postsynaptic neuron,
1429.45 it'll bind to the next neuron,
1430.83 and then it sets off a cascade.
1433.34 It's kind of like a bucket
brigade of one thing,
1435.3 getting handed off to the next,
1436.59 to the next, to the next.
1438.07 It's G protein-coupled receptors.
1440.46 And anytime you hear about these GPCRs
1442.17 or G protein-coupled receptors,
1444.41 pay attention because
they're really interesting.
1446.66 They're slow,
1447.92 but they also can have
multiple cascades of effects.
1451.16 They can impact even gene
expression at some level.
1454.37 They can change what a
cell actually becomes.
1457.27 They can change how well
or how poorly that cell
1460.61 will respond to the same
signal in the future.
1464.0 So dopamine works through
the slower process.
1466.79 These G protein-coupled receptors.
1468.46 And so its effects tend to
take a while in order to occur.
1474.3 This aspect of dopamine
transmission is important
1477.83 because it now underscores two things.
1479.48 One, there's two pathways
for dopamine to communicate.
1482.56 One for movement,
1483.393 one for motivation and craving.
1484.69 There's two spatial scales
at which dopamine can operate
1489.06 synaptically or volumetrically.
1491.25 And dopamine can have slow effects,
1495.04 really slow effects,
1496.27 or even very long lasting effects.
1498.32 And it even can control gene expression.
1500.89 It can actually change
the way that cells behave.
1503.51 One thing that's not often
discussed about dopamine,
1505.56 but is extremely important to know
1507.94 is that dopamine doesn't work on its own.
1511.07 Neurons that release dopamine
co-release glutamate.
1515.91 Glutamate is a neurotransmitter
1518.6 and it's a neurotransmitter
that is excitatory,
1521.23 meaning it stimulates neurons
to be electrically active.
1524.81 So now even if you don't
know any cell biology,
1528.387 you should start to gain a picture
1529.96 that dopamine is responsible for movement,
1532.6 motivation and drive.
1534.074 It does that through two pathways,
1535.77 but also the dopamine
stimulates action in general,
1539.72 because it releases this
excitatory neurotransmitter.
1542.02 It tends to make certain
neurons that are nearby
1545.93 or even that are far away,
1547.08 because of volumetric release,
1548.3 it tends to make those more active.
1550.12 So dopamine is really stimulating.
1552.29 And indeed we say that
dopaminergic transmission
1556.37 or dopamine tends to
stimulate sympathetic arousal.
1560.65 Sympathetic doesn't have
anything to do with sympathy.
1562.73 It's just simply means that it tends
1565.33 to increase our levels of alertness.
1567.33 It tends to bring an animal or a human
1569.73 into a state of more alertness, readiness
1573.06 and desire to pursue
things outside the confines
1576.34 of its skin.
1577.43 So if I were to just put
a really simple message
1581.08 around dopamine it would be,
1582.85 there's a molecule in your brain and body
1584.93 that when released tends to
make you look outside yourself,
1590.16 pursue things outside yourself,
1592.54 and to crave things outside yourself.
1596.65 The pleasure that arrives
from achieving things
1599.1 also involves dopamine,
1600.5 but is mainly the consequences
of other molecules.
1603.86 But if ever you felt
lethargic and like just lazy
1606.66 and you had no motivation or drive,
1608.31 that's a low dopamine state.
1610.53 If ever you felt really
excited, motivated,
1612.98 even if you're a little
scared to do something.
1615.71 Maybe you did your first skydive,
1617.09 or you're about to do your first skydive,
1619.04 or you're about to do some public speaking
1620.013 and you really don't want to screw it up,
1622.86 you are in a high dopamine state.
1625.65 Dopamine is a universal
currency in all mammals,
1628.93 but especially in humans
for moving us toward goals
1633.7 and how much dopamine is in
our system at any one time
1637.67 compared to how much
dopamine was in our system
1640.57 a few minutes ago,
1642.3 and how much we remember
enjoying a particular experience
1645.9 of the past.
1647.79 That dictates your
so-called quality of life
1650.78 and your desire to pursue things.
1653.29 This is really important.
1654.123 Dopamine is a currency,
1656.31 and it's the way that you track pleasure.
1658.66 It's the way that you track success.
1660.39 It's the way that you track
1662.03 whether or not you are
doing well or doing poorly.
1664.95 And that is subjective,
1667.04 but if your dopamine is too low,
1670.37 you will not feel motivated.
1672.04 If your dopamine is really high,
1674.21 you will feel motivated.
1675.41 And if your dopamine is
somewhere in the middle,
1677.81 how you feel depends on whether or not
1679.72 you had higher dopamine a few
minutes ago or lower dopamine.
1684.29 This is important,
1685.8 your experience of life and
your level of motivation
1688.83 and drive depends on how much
dopamine you have relative
1694.57 to your recent experience.
1697.13 This is again, something
that's just not accounted
1700.33 for in the simple
language of dopamine hits.
1703.41 Okay?
1704.243 A simple way to envision dopamine hits
1706.91 is every time you do something you like,
1708.38 you to piece of chocolate,
1709.25 dopamine hit.
1710.083 You look at your Instagram,
1710.99 dopamine hit.
1711.823 You see someone you like,
1712.656 dopamine hit.
1714.34 All these things
described as dopamine hits
1717.57 neglect the fact that if
you scroll social media
1720.68 and you see something you really like,
1722.93 dopamine hit.
1723.77 Sure there's an increase in dopamine,
1725.84 but then you get to
something else and you go,
1728.43 hmm, not that interesting.
1729.72 However, had you arrived
at that second thing first,
1733.56 you might think that it
was really interesting.
1736.82 If you had arrived to
that second Instagram post
1739.58 three days later or four days later,
1741.6 you might find it extremely interesting.
1743.99 Again, how much dopamine you
experience from something
1747.29 depends on your baseline level of dopamine
1749.35 when you arrive there,
1750.84 and your previous dopamine peaks.
1754.18 Okay?
1755.013 That's super important to understand,
1756.65 and it's completely neglected
by the general language
1759.23 of dopamine hits.
1760.23 This is why when you
repeatedly engage in something
1763.73 that you enjoy,
1765.34 your threshold for enjoyment
goes up and up and up.
1769.09 So I want to talk about that process.
1770.99 And I want to explain
how that process works,
1772.563 because if you understand that process,
1774.88 and you understand some of
these schedules and kinetics
1777.79 as we call them around dopamine,
1778.623 you will be in a terrific position
1780.86 to use any dopamine enhancing
tools that you decide to use.
1784.58 You'll be in an excellent
position to modulate
1786.98 and control your own dopamine release
1788.8 for optimal motivation and drive.
1791.0 I realized that was a lot of information
1793.39 about the biology of dopamine,
1795.03 sort of like trying to make you drink
1796.51 from the fire hose of dopamine biology.
1799.32 However, I realized that some people
1800.6 probably want even more information
1802.66 about the biology of
dopamine transmission.
1805.75 If you're interested in that,
1807.29 I'll post a link to a
absolutely stellar review
1809.89 that was published in
Nature Reviews Neuroscience
1812.4 called spatial and temporal
scales of dopamine transmission.
1815.51 It is quite detailed,
1816.65 but they have beautiful diagrams
1818.27 and can walk you through all the things
1820.31 that I just described and
get into even more detail.
1822.73 We'll put a link to that
in the caption on YouTube.
1826.28 Right now, I want to share
with you two anecdotes,
1829.4 one from my own life,
1830.67 and one from some fairly recent history
1834.26 that illustrate some of the
core biology of dopamine
1838.17 and how profoundly it
can shape our experience.
1841.6 The first one is a really
tragic situation that occurred.
1847.2 This was in the 80s,
1849.34 there was a outbreak of what
looked like Parkinsonian
1854.24 symptoms in a young population.
1856.33 So many of you heard
of Parkinson's disease.
1858.24 Parkinson's disease is a disease
in which people initially
1862.01 start to quake, can't
generate smooth movements,
1865.12 they'll have issues with speech,
1866.35 sometimes cognition as well.
1868.59 There are examples like Michael J. Fox,
1870.98 which are kind of early onset.
1872.97 Parkinson's typically it hits people
1875.3 a little bit later in life.
1876.71 There's a genetic component.
1879.66 But there is this question,
1882.1 and there's always been this question
1883.2 whether or not certain lifestyle factors
1885.28 can also create Parkinson's?
1887.62 And some years ago there was a situation
1891.786 where street laboratories,
1895.32 illicit laboratories were
trying to make a drug
1898.39 called MPPP, which is an
opioid light compound.
1901.8 It's a bit like heroin,
1904.17 and heroin addicts seeking
heroin went out and bought
1908.104 what they thought was MPPP.
1911.68 Unfortunately, it was not MPPP.
1916.16 I mean, it would have been
tragic if it was anyway
1918.04 because they were drug addicts,
1919.23 but what they ended up taking
turned out to be a lot worse.
1922.32 What they ended up taking was MPTP,
1925.75 and MPTP can arise in
the synthesis of MPPP.
1930.79 So someone in a lab someplace,
1932.73 this was mainly in the
Central Valley in California,
1934.7 but elsewhere as well.
1936.88 Somebody created MPTP,
1940.19 and what ended up happening
was a large number
1943.86 of young people who were opioid addicts
1946.83 became completely boxed in paralyzed.
1950.27 Couldn't speak, couldn't blink,
1952.78 couldn't do anything.
1954.27 Couldn't function, couldn't move.
1955.83 So both aspects of dopamine
transmission were disrupted.
1960.97 They had no motivation and drive.
1963.33 They couldn't generate
any movement of any kind.
1965.76 They were literally locked in frozen.
1968.76 And sadly, this is irreversible.
1971.57 It's irreversible,
1972.77 because what MPTP does is it
kills the dopaminergic neurons
1978.21 of the substantia nigra
that nigrostriatal pathway
1980.94 that's involved in generating movement.
1982.83 And it kills the dopaminergic neurons
1985.23 of the so-called
mesocorticolimbic pathway.
1988.01 I was in college when this
whole MPTP thing happened.
1991.02 And I remember hearing this story.
1993.14 At the time, I had no understanding
1995.41 of what it is to have very
high levels of dopamine
1998.44 or extremely depleted levels of dopamine.
2000.71 There was no reason why I
should have that understanding.
2002.59 I mean, of course I had
experienced different pleasures
2004.74 of different kinds and
I've had lows in my life,
2007.69 but nothing to the extreme
that I'm about to discuss.
2013.81 I got Giardia.
2015.6 And Giardia is a stomach bug
that if any of you ever had it,
2019.79 it is terrible.
2020.79 It's terrible diarrhea.
2022.01 You end up very dehydrated very quickly.
2023.97 You drop a ton of weight and
it is extremely unpleasant.
2028.99 I ended up going to the emergency room,
2031.7 and in the emergency room,
2033.83 I begged them for something
to stop up my guts.
2036.13 And they gave it to me.
2037.38 They put a saline line into rehydrate me
2039.53 and they injected something
into the saline bag.
2042.7 And within minutes I felt more sadness,
2048.74 more overwhelming sense of depression,
2053.36 basically, lower than I'd
ever felt in my entire life.
2056.63 It was absolutely profound.
2059.2 I was crying endlessly without
knowing why I was crying.
2063.72 I was miserable.
2064.8 And I asked them, what did you inject?
2066.78 And they said, "We injected Thorazine."
2069.06 Thorazine is an antipsychotic drug.
2071.57 It's actually used to
block dopamine receptors.
2074.16 It's what's given to people
who have schizophrenia.
2077.42 Often is given to people
who have schizophrenia,
2079.48 because schizophrenia
involves among other things
2082.89 elevated levels of dopamine.
2085.51 It was horrible.
2087.9 The experience of it was miserable,
2090.66 unlike anything I'd ever experienced.
2093.19 And so I actually said to them,
2095.827 "What did you give me?"
2096.66 They said, "Thorazine."
2097.84 And I said, "You have to give me l-DOPA.
2100.657 "You have to give me something
to get my dopamine levels
2103.357 "back up again."
2104.19 And they did.
2105.023 They gave me an injection
of l-DOPA into the bag,
2107.36 went straight to my bloodstream.
2108.55 And within minutes I felt fine again.
2112.26 It was incredible.
2113.093 And it really opened up
my mind and my experience
2116.3 to what it is to have
absolutely plummeted levels
2119.89 of dopamine.
2120.723 And there's nothing more
miserable than that I'll tell you.
2123.16 And these poor souls who
had this MPTP experience,
2127.87 unfortunately, they couldn't
recover those cells.
2129.85 People who have severe Parkinson's
2132.03 are struggling with this as well,
2133.4 because in Parkinson's
and in Lewy body dementia,
2135.54 the dopaminergic neurons often die.
2137.83 It's not just a problem with those neurons
2139.44 releasing enough dopamine.
2140.98 Later, we're going to
talk about some approaches
2143.25 to maintaining dopaminergic neuron health
2146.08 and things that we can all do for that.
2147.83 But I will tell you these dopamine neurons
2150.01 that we all have are very
precious for movement
2152.56 and mood and motivation.
2154.28 Having experienced what it is
to have very, very low levels
2158.2 of dopamine or in this case
to have my dopamine receptors
2160.79 blocked from Thorazine was
eye-opening to say the least,
2166.82 and has given me tremendous
sensitivity to the fact
2169.67 that dopamine is perhaps one
of the most powerful molecules
2173.94 that any of us has inside of us.
2176.48 And the one that we ought to
all think very carefully about
2179.32 how we leverage,
2180.153 because while most
experiences and most things
2184.41 that we do, and take and eat and cetera,
2187.29 won't create enormous highs
and enormous lows in dopamine.
2191.75 Even subtle fluctuations
in dopamine really shape
2194.41 our perception of life
and what we're capable of,
2196.88 and how we feel.
2198.12 And so we want to guard those
and we want to understand them.
2200.62 So let's lean into that
understanding about dopamine.
2202.7 And then let's talk about some tools
2204.05 that we can all use to leverage dopamine
2206.51 in order to keep that
baseline in the appropriate,
2209.61 healthy place,
2210.56 and still be able to access
those peaks in dopamine.
2213.84 Because those, after all are
some of what makes life rich
2217.21 and worth living.
2218.42 So let's talk about the
baseline of dopamine
2220.66 that we all have and the peaks in dopamine
2223.67 that we all can achieve
through different activities
2227.08 and things that we ingest.
2230.77 All of us have different
baseline levels of dopamine.
2233.78 Some of this is sure to be genetic.
2237.04 Some people just simply ride
at a level a little bit higher.
2241.27 They're a little bit more excited,
2242.54 they're a little bit more motivated,
2244.66 or maybe they're a lot more
excited or a lot more motivated.
2248.9 Some people are a little mellower,
2250.4 some people are a little less excitable.
2252.5 And some of that has to do with the fact
2254.53 that dopamine doesn't act alone.
2256.89 Dopamine has close cousins or
friends in the nervous system.
2261.33 And I'll just name off a
few of those close cousins
2263.34 and friends.
2265.86 Epinephrin also called adrenaline
2268.66 is the main chemical driver of energy.
2272.04 We can't do anything, anything at all,
2275.13 unless we have some level of epinephrin
2277.02 in our brain and body.
2278.65 It's released from the adrenal glands
2280.07 which right on top our kidneys.
2281.22 It's released from an
area of the brainstem
2283.47 called locus coeruleus.
2285.46 And its release tends to
wake up neural circuits
2288.293 in the brain and wake up various aspects
2291.91 of our body's physiology
and give us a readiness.
2295.81 So it should come as no surprise
2296.97 that dopamine and
epinephrin aka adrenaline
2300.88 hang out together.
2302.33 In fact, epinephrin and adrenaline
are actually manufactured
2306.29 from dopamine.
2308.36 There's a biochemical
pathway involving dopamine
2310.57 which is a beautiful pathway.
2312.23 If ever you want to look it up,
2313.74 you can just look up
biochemistry of dopamine.
2316.16 But what you'll find is that,
2318.27 l-DOPA is converted into dopamine.
2323.22 Dopamine is converted
to two noradrenaline.
2327.397 Norepinephrin, it's also called.
2329.53 And noredrenaline,
norepinephrin is converted
2332.87 into adrenaline.
2334.5 So not only are dopamine and
epinephrin aka adrenaline
2338.85 close cousins,
2340.06 they are actually family members.
2342.29 Okay?
2343.123 They're closely related.
2344.11 I'm not going to get too
deep into epinephrin today.
2346.3 I'm not going to talk too
much about those pathways,
2348.42 but anytime I'm talking about
dopaminergic transmission
2351.06 or that you have a peak in dopamine,
2353.08 inevitably, that means
that you have a peak
2355.14 and release of epinephrin as well.
2357.7 What dopamine does is
dopamine really colors
2361.6 the subjective experience of an activity
2364.38 to make it more pleasureful,
2366.37 to make it something
that you want more of.
2368.73 Epinephrin is more about energy.
2370.85 Epinephrin alone can be
fear, paralysis, trauma.
2375.81 Not physical paralysis,
but mental paralysis,
2378.28 you know, frozen in fear or
being traumatized or scared.
2383.06 But the addition of dopamine
to that chemical cocktail,
2386.03 if dopamine is released in the brain,
2388.41 well, then that epinephrin
becomes one of excitement.
2393.1 Okay?
2393.933 I'm using a broad brush here,
2394.9 but essentially what you
need to know is that,
2396.93 dopamine and epinephrin aka
adrenaline are family members.
2400.86 And they tend to work
together like a little gang
2403.2 to make you seek out certain things.
2406.07 So what sorts of activities?
2408.15 What sorts of things increase dopamine?
2411.24 And how much do they increase dopamine?
2414.02 Well, let's take a look
at some typical things
2417.74 that people do out there
or ingest out there
2421.37 that are known to increase dopamine.
2423.89 So let's recall that you have
a baseline level of dopamine
2426.61 and that everybody does.
2428.22 And even within a family,
2429.4 you might have family members
who are very excitable,
2431.95 happy and motivated,
2433.18 and others who are less
excitable, happy and motivated.
2436.14 But your level of dopamine has everything
2440.39 to do with those genetics,
2441.84 but also with what you've
experienced in the previous days
2444.68 and the previous months and so on.
2448.22 When you do or ingest certain things,
2450.47 your levels of dopamine
will rise above baseline
2453.53 transiently.
2455.73 And depending on what you do or ingest,
2458.04 it will rise either more or less,
2460.82 and it will be very brief
or a last a long time.
2463.73 So let's take a look at
some of the typical things
2465.57 that people take and do and eat.
2468.87 Some are good for us,
2469.73 some are not good for us.
2472.36 And let's ask how much dopamine
is increased above baseline?
2475.76 Now, of course, these are averages,
2476.97 but these are averages
that have been measured
2479.15 in so-called micro dialysis
studies in animals.
2481.9 So actually extracting
from particular brain areas
2484.05 how much dopamine is released?
2485.46 Or from measuring the serum,
2487.38 the circulating levels
of dopamine in humans.
2492.1 Chocolate.
2494.01 They didn't look at milk
versus dark chocolate.
2495.86 But chocolate will increase
your baseline level of dopamine
2499.233 1.5 times.
2501.73 Okay?
2502.563 So it's a pretty substantial
increase in dopamine.
2504.45 It's transient.
2505.73 It goes away after a few
minutes or even a few seconds.
2510.35 I'll explain what determines
the duration in a minute.
2513.32 But 1.5 times for chocolate.
2516.65 Sex.
2517.99 Both the pursuit of sex and the act of sex
2522.35 increases dopamine two times.
2526.35 So it's a doubling above baseline.
2529.02 Now, of course, there's
going to be variation there,
2531.33 but that's the average
increase in baseline dopamine
2536.26 caused by sex.
2538.61 Later, I will talk about
how the different aspects
2542.33 of the so-called arousal art,
2543.98 the different aspects of sex,
2545.31 believe it or not have a
differential impact on dopamine.
2548.94 But for now as a general
theme or activity,
2553.1 sex doubles the amount
of dopamine circulating
2556.52 in your blood.
2559.11 Nicotine.
2560.52 In particular, nicotine that is smoked
2563.39 like cigarettes and so forth,
2565.98 increases dopamine two and
a half times above baseline.
2569.95 So there's a peak that
goes up above baseline
2573.29 two and a half times higher.
2577.23 It is very short-lived.
2579.2 Anyone who's ever been a chain smoker
2581.52 or observed a chain smoker understands
2583.49 that the increase in
dopamine from nicotine
2586.63 is very short-lived.
2589.89 Cocaine will increase
the level of dopamine
2592.32 in the bloodstream two and
a half times above baseline.
2596.67 And amphetamine another
drug that increases dopamine
2601.36 will increase the amount of
dopamine in the bloodstream
2605.03 10 times above baseline.
2607.46 A tremendous increase in dopamine.
2610.25 Exercise.
2611.81 Now, exercise will have a different impact
2614.49 on the levels of dopamine,
2615.7 depending on how much
somebody subjectively enjoys
2618.89 that exercise.
2620.62 So if you're somebody who loves running,
2623.35 chances are it's going to
increase your levels of dopamine
2627.77 two times above your baseline,
2629.99 not unlike sex.
2633.18 People who dislike exercise will achieve
2635.88 less dopamine increase or
no increase in dopamine
2639.8 from exercise.
2641.04 And if you like other
forms of exercise like yoga
2643.16 or weightlifting or
swimming or what have you.
2645.96 Again, it's going to vary by
your subjective experience
2648.35 of whether or not you enjoy that activity.
2651.41 This is important.
2652.75 And it brings us back to something
2654.15 that we talked about earlier.
2655.32 Remember that mesocorticolimbic pathway?
2659.34 Well, the cortical part is important.
2661.61 The cortical part actually
has a very specific part,
2665.26 which is your prefrontal cortex.
2667.01 The area of your forebrain
that's involved in thinking
2670.11 and planning and involved in assigning
2674.07 a rational explanation to something,
2676.61 and involved in assigning
a subjective experience
2679.83 to something, right?
2681.15 So for instance, the pen
that I'm holding right now,
2683.29 it's one of these Pilot V5s.
2684.62 I love these Pilot V5s.
2685.73 They don't sponsor the podcast.
2686.66 I just happen to like them.
2687.53 I liked the way that they write,
2688.87 how they feel.
2690.96 If I spent enough time thinking about it,
2692.51 or talking about it,
2693.343 I could probably get a dopamine increase
2694.73 just talking about this Pilot V5.
2696.27 And that's not because
I have the propensity
2698.88 to release dopamine easily,
2700.3 it's that as we start
to engage with something
2702.83 more and more and what we say about it,
2705.07 and what we encourage
ourselves to think about it,
2708.03 has a profound impact on its rewarding
2711.12 or non rewarding properties.
2713.33 Now, it's not simply the case
that you can lie to yourself,
2715.81 and you can tell yourself I love something
2717.3 and when you don't really love it,
2718.63 and it will increase dopamine.
2720.92 But what's been found over and over again,
2722.79 is that if people journal about something
2724.61 or they practice some form of
appreciation for something,
2727.81 or they think of some aspect
of something that they enjoy,
2731.58 the amount of dopamine that
that behavior will evoke
2735.61 tends to go up.
2737.19 So for people that hate exercise,
2738.71 you can think about
some aspect of exercise
2741.61 that you really enjoy.
2742.69 However, I will caution you
against saying to yourself,
2748.01 I hate exercise or I hate
studying or I hate this person,
2752.73 but I love the reward I
give myself afterward.
2755.96 Later, we're going to talk about
how rewards given afterward
2759.32 actually make the situation worse.
2761.69 They won't make you like
exercise more or study more,
2764.64 they actually will undermine
the dopamine release
2767.12 that would otherwise
occur for that activity.
2769.49 So certain things chemicals
have a universal effect.
2773.61 They make everybody's dopamine go up.
2776.09 So some people like chocolate,
2777.57 some people don't of course,
2779.42 but in general, it make has causes
2781.41 this increase in dopamine.
2782.91 But sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine,
2785.406 those things cause increases in dopamine
2788.07 and everybody that takes them.
2790.98 Things like exercise, studying, hard work,
2793.43 working through a
challenge in a relationship
2795.35 or working through
something hard of any kind
2798.16 that is going to be subjective
2800.32 as to how much dopamine will be released.
2802.78 And we will return to
that subjective component
2805.37 in a little bit.
2806.84 But now you have a sense
of how much dopamine
2810.94 can be evoked by different activities
2813.11 and by different substances.
2815.02 One that you might be
wondering about is caffeine.
2817.46 I'm certainly drinking my caffeine today,
2819.36 and I do enjoy caffeine
in limited quantities.
2823.54 I drink yerba mate and I
drink coffee and I love it.
2828.46 Does it increase dopamine?
2830.14 Well, a little bit.
2831.86 Caffeine will increase
dopamine to some extent,
2834.42 but it is pretty modest
compared to the other things
2837.63 that I described.
2838.84 Chocolate, sex, nicotine,
cocaine, amphetamine and so on.
2842.58 However, there's a
really interesting paper
2845.43 published in 2015.
2846.91 This is Volkow et al.
2847.87 You can look up it's very easy to find.
2850.61 That showed that regular
ingestion of caffeine,
2853.64 whether or not it's from
coffee or otherwise,
2856.15 increases up regulation of
certain dopamine receptors.
2860.98 So caffeine actually makes
you able to experience
2866.19 more of dopamines effects.
2867.96 Because as I mentioned before,
2869.1 dopamine is vomited out into the synapse
2871.31 or it's released volumetrically,
2872.6 but then it has to bind someplace
2874.0 and trigger those G
protein-coupled receptors.
2876.88 And caffeine increases the number,
2879.75 the density of those G
protein-coupled receptors.
2883.44 Now, sitting back and thinking about that,
2886.06 you might think, oh yeah, you know,
2887.44 sometimes I'll notice people,
2889.35 at least in the old days
that used to be a cigarette
2891.94 and a cup of coffee.
2893.15 Or when people drink alcohol,
2894.7 oftentimes they'll smoke.
2896.31 And it's well-known
that different compounds
2899.02 like alcohol and nicotine
or caffeine and nicotine
2903.07 or certain behaviors and
certain drugs can synergize
2906.7 to give bigger dopamine increases.
2908.8 And this is not terribly uncommon.
2910.63 There are a lot of people nowadays
2912.19 who for instance take
pre-workout energy drinks.
2914.79 They'll drink,
2915.76 I won't name names,
2916.593 but they'll drink a canned energy drink
2918.69 or they'll drink a pre-workout
2920.53 and they'll try and get
that big stimulation
2922.94 that stimulant effect for the dopamine,
2924.71 the norepinephrin, that
family of molecules
2927.06 that works together to make you motivated.
2928.81 And then they'll also exercise
to try and get even more
2931.76 of a dopaminergic experience
out of that workout.
2934.98 Sometimes it's also to perform
better as well, of course,
2939.13 but as we'll talk about in a few minutes,
2941.88 that aspect or that approach rather
2944.18 of trying to just get your dopamine
2945.6 as high as you possibly can,
2947.08 in order to get the
most out of experience,
2949.58 turns out to not be the best approach.
2951.87 And what you'll find as we
talk about dopamine schedules
2956.03 is that layering together multiple things,
2959.69 substances and activities
2961.75 that lead to big increases in dopamine,
2964.07 actually can create pretty severe issues
2967.02 with motivation and energy
right after those experiences
2970.5 and even a couple of days later.
2972.21 So I'm not saying that
people shouldn't take
2974.0 the occasional pre-workout
if that's your thing,
2975.83 or drink a cup of coffee
or two before working out
2978.63 now and again.
2979.463 Some people really enjoy that.
2980.72 I certainly do that every once in a while,
2982.77 but if you do it too often,
2984.29 what you'll find is that your
capacity to release dopamine
2988.4 and your level of motivation
and drive and energy overall
2991.52 will take a serious hit.
2993.41 Now, I've been alluding
to this dopamine peaks
2995.8 versus dopamine baseline things
2997.58 since the beginning of the episode.
2998.89 I talked about tonic and
phasic release and so forth.
3002.0 But now let's really drill
into what this means,
3004.34 and how to leverage it
for our own purposes.
3008.01 In order to do that, let's
take a step back and ask,
3010.24 why would we have a
dopamine system like this?
3012.827 Why would we have a
dopamine system at all?
3015.15 Well, we have to remember
what our species primary
3019.66 interest is?
3020.94 Our species like all
species has a main interest,
3025.03 and that's to make more of itself.
3026.78 And it's just about sex and reproduction.
3028.62 It's about forging for resources.
3031.35 Resources can be food,
3032.6 it can be water can be salt,
3034.21 it can be shelter,
3036.14 it can be social connection.
3039.09 Dopamine is the universal
currency of forging and seeking,
3044.26 right?
3045.216 We call sometimes talk about
motivation and craving,
3046.82 but what we mean in the
evolutionary adaptive context,
3049.63 what we mean is forging and seeking.
3051.2 Seeking water, seeking
food, seeking mates.
3054.82 Seeking things that make us feel good
3056.35 and avoiding things that
don't make us feel good.
3058.31 But in particular seeking things
3059.76 that will provide sustenance
and pleasure in the short-term
3063.8 and will extend the
species in the long-term.
3067.39 Once we understand that
dopamine is a driver for us
3070.46 to seek things,
3072.28 it makes perfect sense as to why
3074.29 it would have a baseline
level and it would have peaks.
3077.44 And that the baseline and
peaks would be related
3079.92 in some sort of direct way.
3081.96 Here's what I mean by that.
3083.85 Let's say that you were not alive now,
3086.13 but you were alive 10,000 years ago.
3088.95 And you woke up and you
looked and you realized
3091.68 you had minimal water and
you had minimal food left.
3096.17 Maybe you have a child,
3097.18 maybe you have a partner,
3098.59 maybe you're in an entire village,
3099.98 but you realize that you need things.
3102.66 Okay?
3105.1 You need to be able to generate the energy
3107.29 to go seek those things.
3109.07 And chances are there were
dangers in seeking those things.
3112.14 Yes, it could be saber-tooth tigers
3113.91 and things of that sort,
3115.19 but there are other dangers too.
3116.88 There's the danger of a cut to your skin
3118.49 that could lead to infection.
3119.53 There's the danger of storms,
3120.81 there's the danger of cold,
3121.94 there's the danger of leaving
your loved ones behind.
3124.72 So you go out and forage, right?
3127.51 You could be hunting,
you could be gathering,
3128.97 or you could be doing both.
3130.95 The going out and foraging process
3133.517 was we are certain driven by dopamine.
3137.05 I mean, there's no fossil
record of the brain,
3138.77 but the circuits have existed.
3140.04 We know for tens of thousands,
3141.79 if not hundreds of thousands of years.
3143.86 And they are present in every
animal, not just mammals,
3147.04 but even in little worms like C. elegans,
3148.88 it's the same process.
3149.97 It's mediated by dopamine.
3152.31 So dopamine drives you to
go out and look for things.
3155.13 And then let's say you
find a couple berries,
3157.54 and these ones are rotten,
3158.42 these ones are good.
3159.54 Maybe you hunt an animal and kill it,
3161.7 or you find an animal
that was recently killed
3163.71 and you decide to take the meat.
3166.32 You are going to achieve,
3168.01 or I should say, experience
some sort of dopamine release.
3171.6 You found the reward.
3172.86 That's great.
3174.02 But then it needs to
return to some lower level.
3177.52 Why?
3178.353 Well, because if you just stayed there,
3180.43 you would never continue
to forage for more.
3183.6 It doesn't just increase your
baseline and then stay there.
3186.77 It goes back down.
3188.27 And what's very important to understand
3189.9 is that it doesn't just go back down
3191.5 to the level it was before,
3193.56 it goes down to a level below
3196.13 what it was before you went
out seeking that thing.
3199.06 Now, this is counter-intuitive.
3200.99 We often think,
3201.823 Oh, okay, I'm going to
pursue the win, right?
3204.37 Let's move this to modern day.
3207.33 I'm going to run this marathon,
3208.54 I'm going to train for this marathon.
3209.73 Then you run the marathon and you finish,
3212.24 you cross the finish line,
3213.3 you feel great.
3214.48 And you would think, okay, now
I'm set for the entire year,
3217.23 I'm going to feel so much better,
3218.24 I'm going to feel this
accomplishment in my body,
3220.17 it's going to be so great.
3221.5 That's not what happens.
3222.93 You might feel some of those things,
3224.36 but your level of dopamine
has actually dropped
3226.83 below baseline.
3228.48 Now, eventually it will ratchet back up.
3231.36 But two things are really important.
3232.74 First of all, the extent to
which it drops below baseline
3235.84 is proportional to how high the peak was.
3239.05 So if you cross the
finish line pretty happy,
3242.75 it won't drop that much
below baseline afterward.
3246.03 If you cross the finish line ecstatic,
3248.98 well, a day or two later,
3250.16 you're going to feel quite a bit lower
3252.4 than you would otherwise.
3253.41 You might not be depressed,
3254.51 because it depends on where
that baseline was to begin with.
3257.22 But the so-called postpartum depression
3259.1 that people experience after giving birth
3262.73 or after some big win a graduation
3265.67 or any kind of celebration
that postpartum drop
3269.81 in mood and affect and
motivation is the drop
3273.21 in baseline dopamine.
3275.09 This is very important to understand,
3276.44 because this happens on
very rapid timescales
3278.78 and it can last quite a long time.
3281.53 It also explains the
behavior that most of us
3285.36 are familiar with,
3286.193 of engaging in something
that we really enjoy.
3288.27 Going to a restaurant
that we absolutely love,
3291.1 or engaging in some way with some person
3293.18 that we really, really enjoy.
3295.26 But if we continue to
engage in that behavior
3297.34 over and over again,
3299.37 it kind of loses its edge.
3301.23 It starts to kind of
feel less exciting to us.
3306.28 Some of us experienced that
drop in excitement more quickly
3310.94 and more severely than others,
3312.9 but everyone experiences
that to some extent.
3316.39 And this has direct roots
in these evolutionarily
3320.32 conserved circuits.
3322.22 Some of you may be hearing this and think,
3323.417 no, no, no, no that's
not how it works for me.
3325.53 I'm just riding higher
and higher all the time.
3327.58 I love my kids,
3328.55 I love my job,
3329.46 I love school,
3330.293 I love wins,
3331.14 I don't want losses.
3333.06 I agree.
3335.35 We all feel good when
we are achieving things,
3337.51 but oftentimes we are feeling good
3340.15 because we are layering in
different aspects of life,
3343.9 consuming things and doing things
3344.983 that increase our dopamine.
3346.5 We're getting those peaks,
3348.3 but afterward the drop in baseline occurs,
3352.74 and it always takes a
little while to get back
3355.86 to our stable baseline.
3358.19 We really all have a sort
of dopamine set point.
3361.54 And if we continue to
indulge in the same behaviors
3364.82 or even different behaviors
that increase our dopamine
3367.46 in these big peaks over
and over and over again,
3370.04 we won't experience the same level of joy
3372.6 from those behaviors or
from anything at all.
3376.38 Now, that has a name.
3377.3 It's called addiction.
3378.62 But even for people who aren't addicted,
3382.02 even for people don't an attachment
3384.02 to any specific substance or behavior,
3386.4 this drop in bay below baseline
after any peak in dopamine
3390.21 is substantial.
3391.8 And it governs whether or not
we are going to feel motivated
3394.36 to continue to pursue other things.
3397.01 Fortunately, there's a
way to work with this,
3399.93 such that we can
constantly stay motivated,
3402.15 but also keep that baseline of dopamine
3404.25 at an appropriate, healthy level.
3406.43 A previous guest on the
Huberman Lab Podcast
3408.74 was Dr. Anna Lembke.
3409.92 She's head of the Addiction
Dual Diagnosis Clinic
3412.7 at Stanford.
3413.65 Has this amazing book,
3414.597 "Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance
in the Age of Indulgence".
3418.05 If you haven't read the book,
3419.1 I highly encourage you to check it out.
3421.22 It's fantastic.
3422.053 The other terrific book about dopamine
3424.01 is the "Molecule of More",
3425.55 which is a similar in some regard,
3428.04 but isn't so much about addiction,
3429.48 it's more about other types of behaviors.
3431.88 Both books really focus on
these dopamine schedules
3435.55 and the relationship between these peaks
3436.937 and baselines of dopamine.
3440.41 In Dr. Lembke's book,
3441.52 and when she was on the
Huberman Lab Podcast
3443.37 and other podcasts,
3444.203 she's talked about this
pleasure pain balance
3446.07 that when we seek something
that we really like,
3448.82 or we indulge in it,
3449.653 like eating a little piece of chocolate,
3451.21 if we really liked chocolate,
3452.16 there's some pleasure.
3453.57 But then there's a little bit of pain
3457.12 that exceeds the amount of pleasure,
3458.74 and it's subtle,
3460.27 and we experience it as
wanting more of that thing.
3463.74 Okay?
3464.759 So there's a pleasure pain balance,
3465.81 and I'm telling you that
the pleasure and the pain
3468.67 are governed by dopamine to some extent.
3470.7 Well, how could that be?
3471.88 Right?
3472.713 I said before, when you
engage in an activity
3474.93 or when you ingest something
that increases dopamine,
3476.957 the dopamine levels go up,
3478.88 you know, to substantial degree
3480.35 with all the things I listed off.
3484.17 Where's the pain coming from?
3486.1 Well, the pain is coming
from the lack of dopamine
3489.12 that follows.
3490.97 And you now know what that
lack of dopamine reflects.
3496.01 How do you know?
3497.11 Well, earlier we were
talking about how dopamine
3499.71 is released between neurons.
3502.05 And I mentioned two ways.
3503.14 One, is into the synapse
where it can activate
3505.67 the postsynaptic neuron.
3506.76 And the other was what I
called volumetric release
3508.81 where it is distributed more broadly.
3511.04 It's released out over a bunch of neurons.
3515.27 In both cases it's
released from these things
3517.99 we call synaptic vesicles,
3519.21 literally little bubbles,
tiny, tiny little bubbles
3522.21 that contain dopamine.
3523.3 Prrr! They get vomited out into the area
3525.82 or into the synapse.
3527.6 Well, those vesicles get depleted.
3532.12 For the synaptic physiologists out there,
3534.44 we call this the readily
releasable pool of dopamine.
3538.93 We can only deploy dopamine
that is ready to be deployed.
3543.13 That's packaged in those little
vesicles and ready to go.
3545.47 It's like when you order a
product and they say out of stock
3548.55 until two months from now.
3550.57 Well, it's not ready to be released.
3552.35 Same thing with dopamine.
3553.25 There's a pool of
dopamine that synthesized,
3556.48 and you can only release the dopamine
3560.05 that's been synthesized.
3560.97 It's the readily releasable pool.
3563.75 The pleasure pain balance
doesn't only hinge
3567.03 on the readily releasable
pool of dopamine,
3569.43 but a big part of the
pleasure pain balance
3573.2 hinges on how much dopamine is there?
3576.68 And how much is ready and
capable of being released
3579.42 into the system?
3581.22 So now we've given some meat to this thing
3585.01 that we call the pleasure pain balance,
3587.27 and now it should make perfect sense
3589.72 why if you take something or do something
3592.66 that leads to huge increases in dopamine,
3595.81 afterward your baseline should drop
3598.26 because there isn't a
lot of dopamine around
3601.01 to keep your baseline going.
3604.32 Fortunately, most people do not experience
3607.29 or pursue enormous increases in dopamine
3610.16 leading to the severe drops in baseline.
3614.07 Many people do, however,
3615.56 and that's what we call addiction.
3617.93 When somebody pursues
a drug or an activity
3620.44 that leads to huge increases in dopamine.
3622.84 And now you understand that afterward
3624.35 the baseline of dopamine drops
3626.476 because of depletion of dopamine,
3628.393 that readily releasable pool.
3630.56 The dopamine is literally
not around to be released,
3633.097 and so people feel pretty lousy
3635.67 and many people make the mistake
of then going and pursuing
3639.39 the dopamine evoking the
dopamine releasing activity
3642.74 or substance again thinking mistakenly
3646.35 that it's going to
bring up their baseline.
3648.13 It's going to give them that peak again.
3650.37 Not only does it not give them a peak,
3652.06 their baseline gets lower and lower
3654.23 because they're depleting
dopamine more and more and more.
3657.31 And we've seen this over and over again
3659.52 when people get addicted to something
3661.69 then they're not achieving
much pleasure at all.
3665.778 You can even see this with video games.
3668.28 People will play a video game,
3669.86 they love it,
3670.97 it's super exciting to them,
3672.64 and then they'll keep playing
and playing and playing,
3675.24 and either one of two things
happens typically both.
3679.58 First of all,
3680.79 I always say addiction is
a progressive narrowing
3683.75 of the things that bring you pleasure.
3685.16 So oftentimes what will
happen is the person
3687.15 only has excitement and can
achieve dopamine release
3691.65 to the same extent doing that behavior
3693.73 and not other behaviors.
3695.19 And so they start losing
interest in school,
3697.6 they start losing
interest in relationships.
3699.94 they start losing interest
in fitness and wellbeing
3702.35 and depletes their life.
3704.614 And eventually what typically happens is,
3707.99 they will stop getting dopamine release
3710.26 from that activity as well,
3712.26 and then they drop into a
pretty serious depression
3715.16 and this can get very severe and people
3717.03 have committed suicide from
these sorts of patterns
3720.26 of activity.
3721.73 But what about the more typical scenario?
3724.25 What about the scenario of somebody
3726.69 who is really good at
working during the week,
3730.13 they exercise during the week,
3731.84 they drink on the weekends?
3733.7 Well, that person is
only consuming alcohol
3736.25 maybe one or two nights a week,
3738.03 but oftentimes that same
person will be spiking
3742.54 their dopamine with food
during the middle of the week.
3745.4 Now, we all have to eat
and it's nice to eat foods
3747.55 that we enjoy.
3748.383 I certainly do that.
3749.49 I love food in fact.
3751.41 But let's say they're eating foods
3754.34 that really evoke a
lot of dopamine release
3756.21 in the middle of the week,
3757.18 they're drinking one or
two days on the weekend,
3759.8 they are one of these
work, hard play hard type.
3762.57 So they're swimming a
couple miles in the ocean
3765.37 in the middle of the week as well.
3767.759 They're going out dancing
once on the weekend.
3769.96 Sounds like a pretty balanced
life as I describe it.
3773.39 Well, here's the problem.
3776.11 The problem is that
dopamine is not just evoked
3780.35 by one of these activities,
3781.56 dopamine is evoked by
all of these activities.
3784.33 And dopamine is one currency
of craving motivation
3788.93 and desire and pleasure.
3791.28 There's only one currency.
3793.5 So even though if you
look at the activities,
3796.78 you'd say, well, it's just on the weekends
3798.52 so this thing is only a
couple of times a week.
3800.883 If you looked at dopamine
simply as a function,
3803.9 as a chemical function
of peaks and baseline,
3806.97 it might make sense why this person
3808.52 after several years of
work hard, play hard
3811.5 would say, yeah, you know I'm
feeling kind of burnt out.
3814.07 I'm just not feeling like
I have the same energy
3815.89 that I did a few years ago.
3817.38 And of course there
are age-related reasons
3819.31 why people can experience drops in energy,
3822.45 but oftentimes what's happening
3825.25 is not some sort of depletion
and cellar metabolism
3828.14 that's related to aging.
3829.12 What's happening is they're
spiking their dopamine
3831.46 through so many different
activities throughout the week,
3834.81 that their baseline is
progressively dropping.
3837.26 And in this case it can be very subtle.
3839.57 It can be very, very subtle.
3840.93 And that's actually a very
sinister function of dopamine
3846.36 we could say.
3847.193 Which is that it can often
drop in imperceptible ways,
3850.78 but then at once it reaches
a threshold of low dopamine,
3855.37 we just feel like,
3856.31 hmm, we can't really get
pleasure from anything anymore.
3858.64 What used to work doesn't work anymore.
3860.49 So it starts to look a lot
like the more severe addictions
3863.12 or the more acute addictions
to things like cocaine
3866.03 and amphetamine which lead
to these big increases,
3868.42 these big spikes in dopamine,
3869.65 and then these very severe
drops in the baseline.
3873.41 Now, of course, we all
should engage in activities
3877.03 that we enjoy.
3878.29 I certainly do,
3879.13 everybody should.
3879.963 A huge part of life is
pursuing activities and things
3882.763 that we enjoy.
3884.72 The key thing is to
understand this relationship
3887.26 between the peaks and the baseline,
3888.67 and to understand how they
influence one another.
3890.97 Because once you do that,
3892.34 you can start to make really
good choices in the short run
3895.36 and in the long run to
maintain your level of dopamine
3898.66 baseline.
3899.89 Maybe even raise that
level of dopamine baseline
3902.9 and still get those peaks and
still achieve those feelings
3906.29 of elevated motivation,
elevated desire and craving.
3910.04 Because again, those peaks
and having a sufficiently
3915.03 healthy high level of dopamine baseline
3917.74 are what drove the
evolution of our species,
3919.468 and they're really what drive
the evolution of anyone's life
3921.9 progression too.
3922.8 So they're a good thing.
3923.633 Dopamine is a good thing.
3925.43 Just very briefly, because
it was also covered
3927.55 in the interview episode
I did with Anna Lembke
3931.01 about addiction.
3932.5 Some of you might be asking,
3934.19 what should I do if I experience a drop
3936.66 in my baseline level of dopamine
3938.85 because of engagement with
some activity or some substance
3942.88 that led to big peaks?
3945.24 Just to put some color
and example on this,
3948.13 a few episodes ago I talked about a friend
3950.98 who I've known a long time.
3952.4 So it actually the child of a friend
3953.94 who has basically become
addicted to video games,
3957.56 he decided actually after
seeing that episode with Anna
3960.24 to do a 30-day complete fast from phone,
3964.43 from video games and from
social media of all kinds.
3967.5 He's now at day 29 has
really accomplished this,
3971.06 not incidentally, his
levels of concentration,
3973.43 his overall mood are up.
3974.57 He's doing far far better.
3976.92 What he did is hard.
3978.13 In particular first 14
days is really hard,
3980.64 but the way that you
replenish the releasable pool
3983.96 of dopamine is to not
engage in these dopaminergic
3987.64 seeking behaviors.
3989.12 Because remember typically
people arrive at a place
3991.88 where they want to stop
engaging in these behaviors
3994.12 or ingesting substances when
that dopamine is depleted,
3997.17 when they're not getting the same lift.
3998.7 In his case, he was feeling depressed.
4000.27 He thought he had ADHD.
4001.58 They were starting to treat it as ADHD.
4004.46 And certainly there are people
out there who have ADHD,
4007.2 but what he found was that
his levels of concentration
4009.36 are back.
4010.193 He does not need to be treated for ADHD.
4012.377 And actually the psychiatrist
wondered if he did prior
4015.14 to this video game, social media fast.
4018.07 He's feeling good.
4018.92 He's exercising again.
4020.53 I'm not making this up.
4021.61 This is really a very specific,
4024.9 but very relevant example
of how the dopamine system
4028.47 can replenish itself.
4030.69 Of course, if there's a clinical
need for ADHD treatment,
4033.22 by all means pursue that.
4034.74 But I think a lot of
ADHD does go misdiagnosed
4039.34 because of this depletion in dopamine
4041.41 that occurs because of
overindulgence in other activities
4044.02 in the drop in baseline.
4045.7 So for anyone that's experienced
a real drop in baseline
4048.74 who has addictive tendencies,
4051.21 whether or not their
behaviors or substances,
4052.87 that is always going
to be the path forward.
4057.03 Is going to be either cold turkey
4058.92 or through some sort of
tapering to limit interactions
4062.81 with the, what would otherwise
be the dopamine evoking
4065.83 behavior or substance.
4067.44 So let's talk about the optimal
way to engage in activities
4071.96 or to consume things that evoke dopamine.
4075.72 And by no means am I
encouraging people to take drugs
4077.94 of abuse.
4078.773 I would not do that,
4079.606 I am not doing that.
4080.57 But some of the things on these lists
4083.23 of dopamine evoking activities
are things like chocolate,
4087.2 coffee, even if it's indirect.
4090.94 Sex and reproduction,
4091.98 provided it's healthy
consensual context appropriate,
4095.13 age appropriate, species
appropriate of course,
4097.51 is central to our evolution
and progression as a species.
4101.86 So certain things like
cocaine, amphetamine,
4104.8 I will put in the classification of bad.
4106.9 I'm willing to do that.
4107.76 And other things are part of life,
4109.73 food, exercise if that
evokes your dopamine.
4112.61 How are we supposed to engage
with these dopamine evoking
4115.65 activities in ways that are
healthy and beneficial for us?
4118.56 How do we achieve these peaks,
4120.28 which are so central to our
wellbeing and experience of life
4123.06 without dropping our baseline?
4125.07 And the key lies in intermittent
release of dopamine.
4130.29 The real key is to not
expect or chase high levels
4136.03 of dopamine release every time we engage
4138.8 in these activities.
4141.87 Intermittent reward schedules
are the central schedule
4145.21 by which casinos keep you gambling.
4148.83 The central schedule by
which elusive partners
4152.38 or potential partners keep
you texting and pursuing
4156.25 on either side of the relationship.
4158.83 Intermittent schedules are
the way that the internet
4162.08 and social media and all
highly engaging activities
4167.08 keep you motivated and pursuing.
4171.42 And we can take this back
to our evolutionary adaptive
4175.38 scenario where you are out
there looking for water,
4178.41 looking for food,
4180.04 not every trail, not every
pursuit, not every hunch
4184.33 about where the animals will be?
4186.7 Where the food will be?
4187.84 Where the berries will be?
4189.82 Not every single one of those played out.
4194.17 There's something called
dopamine reward prediction error.
4196.6 When we expect something to happen,
4198.92 we are highly motivated to pursue it.
4201.93 If it happens great, we get the reward.
4204.75 The reward comes in various chemical forms
4206.68 including dopamine,
4207.897 and we are more likely to
engage in that behavior again.
4211.06 This is the basis of casino gambling.
4213.61 This is how they keep you going back
4214.87 again and again and again,
4215.98 even though on average
the house really does win.
4220.74 You can transplant that
example to any number
4223.27 of different pleasureful activities.
4224.7 If you're not a gambler and
that doesn't appeal to you,
4227.17 I have to imagine there's
something that appeals to you,
4229.38 something that you do
repeatedly because you enjoy it.
4231.97 And almost inevitably it's
because there's an intermittent
4235.45 schedule.
4237.18 There's a intermittent
schedule by which dopamine
4240.04 sometimes arrives,
4241.25 sometimes a little bit, sometimes a lot,
4243.37 sometimes a medium amount.
4244.96 Okay?
4245.92 That intermittent reinforcement schedule
4248.25 is actually the best schedule
to export to other activities.
4253.64 How do you do that?
4254.97 Well, first of all, if you
are engaged in activities
4259.51 school, sport, relationship, et cetera,
4261.8 where you experience a win,
4264.15 you should be very careful
about allowing yourself
4266.87 to experience huge peaks in dopamine,
4269.14 unless you're willing to
suffer the crash that follows
4273.41 and waiting a period of
time for it to come back up.
4277.09 What would this look like
in the practical sense?
4279.01 Well, let's say you are somebody
4280.24 who really does enjoy exercise,
4282.4 or let's say you're somebody
who kind of likes exercise,
4284.68 but forces yourself to do it,
4286.31 but you make it pleasureful
by giving yourself
4288.56 your favorite cup of coffee first,
4290.5 or maybe taking a pre-workout drink
4292.55 or taking an energy drink
4294.16 or listening to your favorite music.
4295.69 And then you're in the gym
4296.61 and you're listening to your music.
4297.48 That all sounds great, right?
4299.12 Well, it is great except
that by layering together
4302.3 all these things to try and
achieve that dopamine release,
4304.84 and by getting a big peak in dopamine,
4306.82 you're actually increasing the
number of conditions required
4310.95 to achieve pleasure from
that activity again.
4313.59 And so there is a form
of this where sometimes
4316.73 you do all the things that you love
4318.24 to get the optimal workout.
4319.38 You listen to your favorite music,
4320.9 you got your favorite time of day,
4322.64 you have your pre-workout drink,
4323.86 if that's your thing.
4324.693 You do all the things that
give you that best experience
4328.31 of the workout for you.
4330.955 But there's also a version
of this where sometimes
4333.73 you don't do the dopamine
enhancing activities.
4337.22 You don't ingest anything
to increase your dopamine.
4339.89 You just do the exercise.
4342.83 You don't do the exercise
and expect dopamine to arrive
4347.42 through some what we call
exogenous source as well.
4350.277 You might think, well, that sounds lame.
4351.9 I want to continue to enjoy exercising.
4355.03 Ah, well, that's exactly the point.
4357.87 If you want to maintain
motivation for school, exercise,
4360.63 relationships or pursuits
of any duration in kind,
4364.16 the key thing is to make sure
that the peak in dopamine,
4367.77 if it's very high,
doesn't occur too often.
4371.3 And if something does occur very often
4374.42 that you vary how much
dopamine you experience
4377.91 with each engagement in that activity.
4380.3 Now, some activities naturally
have this intermittent
4383.37 property woven into them, right?
4385.29 We sometimes have classes that we like
4387.717 and other classes we don't like.
4389.41 We don't always get straight A's,
4391.41 sometimes we don't get
rewarded with the outcome
4393.86 that we would like.
4394.76 We don't always have the
perfect relationship outcome,
4398.03 but understand that your
ability to experience motivation
4401.47 and pleasure for what comes next
4403.55 is dictated by how much
motivation and pleasure
4406.0 and dopamine you experienced prior.
4409.69 The reason I can't give
a very specific protocol
4412.45 like delete dopamine or lower
dopamine every third time,
4416.07 is that that wouldn't be intermittent.
4418.24 The whole basis of
intermittent reinforcement
4420.74 is that you don't really
have a specific schedule
4424.5 of when dopamine is going to be high,
4426.64 and when dopamine is going to be low
4428.05 and when dopamine is going to be medium.
4429.88 That's a predictable schedule,
4431.36 not a random intermittent schedule.
4433.95 So do like the casinos do
certainly works for them
4437.2 and for activities that you
would like to continue to engage
4440.64 in over time,
4441.84 whatever those happen to be.
4444.01 Start paying attention
to the amount of dopamine
4447.15 and excitement and pleasure
that you achieve with those,
4449.37 and start modulating
that somewhat at random.
4452.01 That might be removing
some of the dopamine
4455.09 releasing chemicals that
you might take prior.
4458.13 Maybe you remove them every time,
4461.06 but then every once in a
while you introduce them,.
4463.59 Maybe it involves sometimes
doing things socially
4467.49 that you enjoy doing socially,
4468.62 sometimes doing the same thing, but alone.
4471.92 There are a lot of
different ways to do this.
4474.23 There are a lot of different
ways to approach this,
4476.27 but now knowing what you know
about peaks and baselines
4479.61 in dopamine and
understanding how important
4482.38 it is not just to achieve peaks,
4483.98 but to maintain that
baseline at a healthy level,
4486.41 it should be straightforward
for you to implement
4488.52 these intermittent schedules.
4490.94 For those of you that are
begging for more specificity,
4494.36 we can give you a tool.
4495.76 One would be, you can flip
a coin before engaging
4499.3 in any of these types of activities
4500.78 and decide whether or not
you are going to allow
4503.797 other dopamine supportive elements
4507.6 to go for instance, into the gym with you.
4509.56 Are you going to listen to music or not?
4511.03 If you enjoy listening to music,
4512.63 well then flip a coin,
4513.65 and if it comes up heads,
4514.72 bring the music in,
4515.553 if it comes up tails, don't.
4517.12 Okay?
4517.953 It sounds like you're
undercutting your own progress,
4519.98 but actually you are
serving your own progress
4523.08 both short-term and
long-term by doing that.
4525.78 Now, the smartphone is
a very interesting tool
4528.622 for dopamine in light of all this.
4532.02 It's extremely common
nowadays to see people texting
4535.2 and doing selfies and
communicating in various ways,
4539.24 listening to podcasts, listening to music,
4541.7 doing all sorts of
things while they engage
4543.65 in other activities or going to dinner
4545.3 and texting other people or making plans,
4547.87 sharing information.
4548.83 That's all wonderful,
4549.69 it gives depth and
richness and color to life,
4552.6 but it isn't just about
our distracted nature
4556.94 when we're engaging with the phone,
4559.48 it's also a way of layering in dopamine.
4562.35 And it's no surprise
that levels of depression
4566.7 and lack of motivation are
really on the increase.
4571.21 Everything that we've
talked about until now
4574.42 sets up an explanation or interpretation
4577.59 of why interacting with digital technology
4581.25 can potentially lead to disruptions
4583.46 or lowering in baseline
levels of dopamine.
4588.89 I can use a personal example for this.
4590.65 I happen to really enjoy working out,
4592.25 I've always really enjoyed it.
4593.95 But in recent years I noticed that,
4597.44 if I was bringing my phone to my workouts,
4599.82 then not only was I a
little bit more distracted
4602.02 and not focusing on what I was doing
4603.62 as much as I could have or should have,
4605.84 but also I started to lose
interest in what I was doing.
4609.43 It wasn't as pleasureful,
4610.87 I would feel like it
just didn't have the same
4613.1 kind of oomph.
4613.933 And I was beginning to
question my motivation.
4616.89 As I started learning more
about this relationship
4619.68 between the peaks and the
bass lines in dopamine.
4622.05 What I realized was that some time ago
4624.42 I probably experienced
a incredible increase
4627.6 in the amount of dopamine
during one of my workouts,
4629.94 because I enjoy working out
and I enjoy listening to music.
4633.81 I also enjoy listening to podcasts,
4635.32 I also enjoy communicating with people.
4637.4 Those are all wonderful pursuits,
4638.73 but I had layered in too
many of them too many times.
4642.41 And then it essentially
wasn't working for me anymore.
4645.96 Much in the same way a drug
wouldn't work for somebody
4648.17 who takes it repeatedly because
their baseline of dopamine
4650.49 is dropping.
4651.56 So at least for this calendar year,
4653.89 I've made a rule for myself,
4655.43 which is I don't allow my
phone into my workouts at all.
4660.44 No music, at least not from the phone.
4662.61 It can be in the room.
4664.64 I might listen to a podcast in the room,
4666.96 but I don't listen to anything
4669.1 or engage in anything on my phone.
4670.56 No texting whatsoever.
4671.49 And most of the time I just
don't even bring it with me
4673.49 for that period of time.
4674.52 It's only a short period of time.
4676.38 I'm not training that often.
4679.87 This is something that I
think has been misinterpreted
4683.98 as people can't be alone now.
4686.43 People talk about, oh, you know,
4687.92 they can't walk across the
street or they can't go anywhere,
4692.0 ride the bus,
4693.36 can't be on the plane
without being in contact.
4695.76 They can't handle just their thoughts.
4697.41 I don't think that's
really what's going on.
4699.16 I think what's happened
is that we achieved
4702.4 the great dopamine increase
4703.82 that comes from this incredible thing
4705.56 which I personally enjoy being
able to communicate by phone,
4709.16 by text and exchange
pictures and send links
4711.41 and these kinds of things, social media.
4713.54 But then what happens is
it doesn't have that same
4716.72 fulfilling aspect to it.
4718.66 And it tends to remove the excitement
4721.29 and the pleasure of the very activities
4723.0 that we are engaged in.
4724.69 So I know this is a hard
one for many people,
4726.9 but I do invite you to
try removing multiple
4731.13 sources of dopamine release
4732.87 or what used to be multiple
sources of dopamine release
4736.14 from activities that you
want to continue to enjoy,
4738.98 or that you want to enjoy more.
4740.85 And now you understand
the biological mechanisms
4743.04 that would underlie a statement like that.
4745.437 It takes a little bit of working with,
4747.85 I know it can be challenging
in the first week
4750.37 or so of not engaging with the phone
4752.76 during any kind of workout.
4754.2 That actually was really tough,
4756.06 but now I'm back to a place
where I enjoy it that much more.
4759.0 I also feel as if I conquered something
4760.59 in terms of the circuitry
related to dopamine.
4763.33 I now understand why something
4765.79 that I enjoyed so much had
become less pleasureful for me.
4769.45 And there's a deep, deep satisfaction
4771.61 that comes from understanding,
4772.59 okay, there wasn't anything wrong with me
4774.67 or what I was doing or anything at all.
4778.47 It was just there was something
wrong with the approach
4780.76 I was taking,
4781.593 which was layering in all
these sources of dopamine
4783.68 and dropping my baseline.
4785.27 For this very same reason,
4786.64 I caution people against
using stimulants every time
4790.98 they study or every time they work out
4794.95 or every time that they do anything
4797.41 that they would like to continue to enjoy
4799.09 and be motivated at.
4800.94 There's one exception which is caffeine,
4802.7 because as I mentioned before,
4804.8 if you like caffeine,
4806.71 that actually could be a good thing
4807.76 for your dopamine system,
4808.69 because it does upregulate
these D2, D3 receptors.
4811.79 So it actually makes whatever dopamine
4813.88 is released by that activity,
4816.2 more accessible or more
functional within the biochemistry
4819.9 and the pathways of your brain and body.
4823.52 However, a number of energy drinks
4825.94 and particular pre-workouts contain things
4828.45 that are precursors to dopamine,
4830.45 and on their own, even if you
didn't engage in the activity
4833.83 would cause the release of
dopamine to a substantial degree.
4836.75 They do cause the release of dopamine
4838.49 to a substantial degree.
4840.11 And over time that will
deplete your dopamine.
4844.12 So energy drinks, pre-workout drinks,
4848.34 drugs of various kinds
that people take to study
4851.32 and pay attention.
4852.153 We talked about some of
these for the ADHD episode,
4854.09 things like Adderall, Ritalin,
armodafinil or modafinil
4858.33 taken repeatedly over time will reduce
4861.646 the level of satisfaction and joy
4863.67 that you get from the activities
4865.19 you engage in while under the
influence of those compounds.
4870.07 I'm not trying to demonize those compounds
4871.87 for their clinical use.
4873.05 What I'm saying is taking stimulants
4874.93 and then engaging in activities
4876.66 that you would like to
continue to feel pleasureful
4879.25 is undercutting the process.
4880.96 And inevitably might not happen tomorrow,
4883.71 might not happen in a month,
4884.94 but inevitably you will have
challenges with motivation
4887.97 and drive related to those activities.
4890.51 Now, some people can
keep it right in check.
4892.26 They can just do the one
can have the energy drink
4894.76 or they only do their pre-workout
before really hard days,
4898.41 for instance.
4899.96 More power to you.
4902.41 I actually do that sometimes, frankly.
4904.77 But people who are trying
to get into that peak
4907.45 super motivated, driven, driven state,
4909.68 really focused every time
they engage in an activity,
4912.91 you are absolutely
undercutting the process
4915.32 and you are undermining your
ability to stay motivated
4917.8 and focused.
4918.93 So just as we talked about
intermittent reward schedules
4923.0 a moment ago,
4925.21 intermittent spiking of
dopamine if you do it at all
4929.0 is definitely the way to go,
4930.31 and chronically trying
to spike your dopamine
4933.03 in order to enhance your
motivation, focus and drive
4935.95 will absolutely undermine your
motivation focus and drive
4939.43 in the long run.
4940.5 Ingestion of caffeine is
somewhat of an exception
4944.8 among the other examples of things
4946.54 I've mentioned to avoid before
4949.01 what would otherwise be
dopamine increasing activities.
4952.29 Because again, caffeine
can increase the density
4957.58 and the efficacy of
these dopamine receptors.
4961.715 It turns out that the source
of caffeine could also matter
4965.18 while coffee or tea or
other forms of caffeine
4968.91 will have this effect of
increasing dopamine receptors.
4972.7 Yerba mate something
I've talked about before
4975.4 on this podcast has some
interesting properties.
4978.21 First of all, it contains caffeine.
4979.94 It's also high in antioxidants.
4982.04 It also contains something called GLP-1
4984.69 which is favorable for
management of blood sugar levels.
4990.23 Yerba mate turns out has also been shown
4993.03 to be neuroprotective specifically
for dopaminergic neurons.
4997.98 Now, I should mention this
is just a couple of studies,
5000.15 so we don't want to conclude
too much from these studies
5003.06 more needs to be done.
5004.5 But they showed that in a model of damage
5007.83 to dopamine neurons,
ingestion of yerba mate,
5011.331 and some of the compounds
within yerba mate
5013.33 can actually serve to
preserve the survival
5015.82 of dopamine neurons in both
the movement related pathway
5018.927 and the motivation pathway.
5021.29 So perhaps you need that incentive
5024.15 in order to ingest your yerba mate,
5026.2 perhaps you don't need any incentive.
5028.26 In my case, I don't need any incentive.
5029.77 I already enjoy yerba mate as my principle
5032.17 source of caffeine,
5033.26 although I do drink coffee as well.
5035.14 But if one were going to consume caffeine,
5037.9 you might consider consuming that caffeine
5040.17 in the form of yerba mate
both for sake of upregulating
5042.87 dopamine receptors and getting
more of a dopamine increase.
5047.84 And of course, for the
similar properties of caffeine
5050.43 if that's what you're seeking.
5052.55 And in addition to that,
5054.02 because your yerba mate does appear
5056.19 to have some sort of neuroprotective
5058.56 and a particular dopamine
neuron protective properties.
5062.13 Now, that doesn't mean that
caffeine is always beneficial.
5064.58 And actually there's one
instance related to dopamine
5067.58 where caffeine can be
particularly dangerous.
5070.76 And this relates to
MDMA so-called ecstasy.
5073.37 MDMA is under investigation
in various clinical trials
5077.49 for its potential to treat
trauma and depression.
5081.94 It's also of course, a drug
that's used recreationally.
5084.79 It's still illegal at
least in the United States.
5090.03 Whether or not MDMA is neurotoxic
5092.64 has been very controversial.
5093.86 Early on it was thought
that it is neurotoxic
5096.28 that it can destroy serotonergic neurons.
5099.98 There were other papers that came out
5101.72 which argued that's not the case.
5104.57 And that's in particular
because one of the early papers
5107.7 published in science magazine claiming
5110.49 that MDMA was neurotoxic.
5113.42 That paper was retracted.
5114.74 It turns out that that
study had mistakenly
5117.45 used methamphetamine instead,
5119.53 and methamphetamine is
known to be neurotoxic.
5123.46 I think most of the data point to the idea
5125.47 that MDMA might not be neurotoxic,
5128.03 but in any case, caffeine
has been shown to increase
5132.31 the toxicity of MDMA receptors.
5134.63 And you might say, "Well,
how could that be?"
5136.47 Well, now you understand
why that could be.
5139.09 Caffeine increases the
density and efficacy
5142.5 of these dopamine receptors,
D2 and D3 receptors.
5145.32 MDMA is a potent drug for
increasing concentrations
5150.46 of dopamine as well as serotonin
and other neuromodulators.
5153.85 And it appears that caffeine
ingestion by upregulating
5157.2 these receptors,
5158.27 can lead to more toxicity of MDMA.
5162.45 So caffeine can be a beneficial
substance in one context,
5166.77 and actually can be a detrimental
5168.85 if not dangerous substance
in another context.
5171.97 Two substances that
greatly increase dopamine,
5174.71 namely amphetamine and cocaine
can cause long-term problems
5180.01 with the dopaminergic pathways.
5182.58 And this is largely based on a study
5184.85 that was published some years ago, 2003,
5187.88 but still holds a lot of merit.
5189.85 This is a paper published in proceeds
5191.85 in the National Academy of Sciences,
5193.28 a very high tier stringent journal.
5196.97 First author is Kolb, K-O-L-B.
5198.94 And the title of the paper
pretty much tells the story.
5202.43 Amphetamine or cocaine limits the ability
5205.16 of later experience to
promote structural plasticity
5207.89 in the neocortex and nucleus accumbens.
5209.43 Neocortex is the outer shell
of the brain more or less.
5214.12 And the nucleus accumbens is part of that,
5216.22 mesolimbic dopamine pathway
for motivation drive
5219.95 and reinforcement.
5221.44 Neuroplasticity of course, is
the brain's ability to change
5224.22 in response to experience.
5225.25 And neuroplasticity is the
basis of learning and memory
5229.64 and essentially remodeling
of our neural circuitry
5233.43 in positive ways of all kinds.
5235.45 And this study was really
one of the first to show
5238.83 that ingesting amphetamine and cocaine
5241.77 because of the high peak in dopamine
5245.42 that it creates and
the low dopamine state,
5248.03 the baseline drop that
it creates afterwards,
5251.77 limits plasticity and learning subsequent
5254.25 to taking amphetamine and cocaine.
5256.37 It was at least in this study shown
5258.88 to be a long lasting effect.
5260.41 I doubt it's a permanent effect,
5261.89 but this should serve as
a serious cautionary note
5265.3 that amphetamine and cocaine
not only can cause a drop
5268.63 in baseline dopamine,
5269.68 but can actually put
the brain into a state
5271.98 in which it cannot learn and
modify itself to get better
5275.33 at least for some period of time.
5277.33 In a previous episode on ADHD,
5280.26 I talked about the widespread use of drugs
5282.79 like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil and armodafinil,
5285.41 all of which lead to very
large increases in dopamine,
5287.89 and for people with ADHD can
really improve their symptoms.
5292.72 But of course there's a
lot of non-prescription,
5295.34 non-clinical use of
those compounds as well.
5298.02 And it stands to reason that
the use of those substances
5301.26 to increase dopamine
could very well provide
5305.02 the same sort of blockade
of neuroplasticity
5307.17 that cocaine and amphetamine do.
5308.66 Because when you look at the
amount of dopamine increase
5312.0 that's triggered by those compounds,
5313.7 it's really comparable.
5315.36 So again, a cautionary note
against spiking one's dopamine
5319.62 too much on a regular basis,
5321.56 unless there's a valid
clinical need for doing that.
5325.55 So we've been focusing a
lot for the last few minutes
5328.19 on the kind of darker side of dopamine
5330.9 and how getting big peaks in
dopamine can be detrimental,
5334.57 but I want to acknowledge the truth,
5336.5 which is that dopamine feels great.
5339.1 Being in pursuit and
motivated and craving things
5341.87 feels wonderful.
5343.35 And I don't want to demonize dopamine.
5345.44 What I'm trying to do
today is to illustrate
5347.47 how dopamine works in your brain
5349.31 so that you can continue to engage
5352.15 in dopamine evoking activities.
5355.79 And certainly there is a
place for ingesting things
5358.172 that can increase dopamine
provided that they are safe
5361.09 for us in the short and long-term.
5365.32 There are activities that
we can do that will give us
5368.93 healthy, sustained increases in dopamine,
5371.64 both the peaks when they
happen and to maintain
5375.47 or even increase our
baseline levels of dopamine.
5377.75 So how do we do that?
5379.14 What are some of these activities?
5381.03 Well, in recent years,
5383.24 there's been a trend toward more people
5385.66 doing so-called cold exposure.
5387.67 In part, this was popularized by Wim Hof,
5391.16 the so-called 'Iceman'
getting into cold showers,
5394.01 taking ice baths, exposing
oneself to cold water
5397.4 of various kinds can in fact
increase our levels of dopamine
5401.64 as well as the neuromodulator
norepinephrine.
5405.55 This is not a new phenomenon.
5408.5 In the 1920s, a guy by the
name of Vincent Priessnitz
5412.09 was one of the first people
to popularize and formalize
5415.66 cold water therapies.
5417.36 He was an advocate of cold water exposure
5420.245 in order to boost the immune system
5422.91 and increase feelings of wellbeing.
5424.6 And actually this practice dates back long
5426.54 before Vincent's popularized it.
5430.12 And Wim Hof is the more
recent iteration of this.
5433.37 First of all, some of
the safety parameters.
5435.26 Let's establish those first.
5436.64 Getting to very, very cold water.
5438.22 You know, 30 degree Fahrenheit
5439.86 or even low 40 degree Fahrenheit
5442.15 can put somebody into a
state of cold water shock.
5444.68 I mean, people can die doing that.
5446.5 So obviously you want to
approach this with some caution,
5449.6 but for most people getting
into 60 degree water
5452.97 or 50 degree water,
5454.14 or if you're acclimated
and comfortable with it,
5457.122 you know, 40 degree
water or 45 degree water
5459.734 can have tremendously beneficial results
5463.34 on your neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine.
5467.65 What temperature of water you can tolerate
5469.74 will depend on how cold
water adapted you are,
5472.91 and how familiar you
are with the experience
5475.55 of getting into cold water.
5477.04 And when I say comfortable with,
5478.7 I should mention, there is never a case
5481.13 in which getting into
cold water does not evoke
5485.542 a release of epinephrin.
5487.65 So the quickening of the breath,
the widening of the eyes,
5490.304 the feeling as if you
can't catch your breath
5492.92 and even some physical pain
at the level of the skin
5495.46 that happens almost every time,
5497.29 or every time that you
get into cold water,
5499.39 even if your cold water adapted.
5501.18 What almost everybody knows
and understands is that,
5504.5 that wall, as I like to
refer to it is coming.
5507.04 That's always the first experience
5508.81 of getting into cold water.
5510.12 There's no real way around that.
5512.47 Now, this study that I mentioned earlier,
5515.38 human physiological responses
to immersion into water
5518.33 of different temperatures,
5519.24 really interesting study
that was done and published
5522.26 in the university of, excuse me,
5524.01 the European Journal
of Applied Physiology.
5526.24 I can provide a link to that
study in the show caption.
5529.73 It's a really interesting study.
5531.02 They looked at people
getting exposed to water
5534.5 that was warm, moderately
cold or very cold.
5536.82 It was 32 degrees Celsius,
20 degrees Celsius,
5539.06 or 14 degrees Celsius.
5541.15 You can just put those
online and do the conversion,
5543.43 or you can do the conversion
to Fahrenheit if you like.
5545.78 But in any case, what they
looked at were the concentrations
5549.87 of things like epinephrin
and dopamine and so on.
5554.17 And what they found
was really interesting.
5556.41 First of all, upon
getting into cold water,
5562.2 the changes in adrenaline
and noradrenaline,
5566.0 epinephrin and norepinephrine
were immediate and fast,
5569.77 and these were huge increases.
5572.06 So that's the getting into the cold water
5573.87 that everybody experiences
5575.21 these huge increases in adrenaline.
5577.32 But then what was
interesting is they observed
5579.188 that dopamine levels started
to rise somewhat slowly
5583.21 and then continued to
rise and reach levels
5586.49 as high as 2.5 times above baseline.
5590.79 That's a remarkably high increase.
5592.79 Remember if we go back to our
examples of chocolate, sex,
5597.78 a doubling above baseline,
5599.21 nicotine two and a half times
above baseline, cocaine.
5603.04 The increase in dopamine
from a cold water exposure
5607.09 of this kind was comparable
to what one sees from cocaine,
5611.12 except, except in this case,
5613.95 it wasn't a rise and crash.
5616.64 It was actually a
sustained rise in dopamine
5620.05 that took a very long
time up to three hours
5622.54 to come back down to baseline.
5624.32 Which is really remarkable,
5626.12 and I think this explains
some of the positive,
5629.72 mental and physical effects
that people report subjectively
5632.969 after doing cold water exposure.
5635.37 One question that many of
you are probably asking
5637.35 is just how cold should the water be?
5639.99 Well, you could mimic what
was done in this study
5641.71 and do 14 degrees Celsius.
5643.25 But for some people that
won't be cold enough,
5645.3 for some people that will be too cold.
5647.62 They did look at the
release of stress hormones
5650.1 like cortisol in addition
to the release of things
5652.2 like epinephrin and adrenaline.
5653.66 And it's interesting that
they noted that in all cases,
5657.32 but especially at that
coldest temperature,
5659.21 there was an increase in cortisol,
5660.67 but that it was transient,
5662.2 That eventually people's cortisol,
5663.947 the stress hormone subsided a bit.
5666.82 There are basically two
different approaches
5668.78 to remaining in the cold
when it's uncomfortable.
5671.72 One is to try and relax yourself.
5674.23 Two, try and practice slow breathing,
5676.83 to try and dilate your gaze.
5678.27 I've talked about this
before in previous podcasts,
5680.14 you go into panoramic
vision to essentially try
5681.81 and calm yourself so that
it's not as stressful
5685.38 in the cold.
5686.69 Other people however, take the
approach of trying to ramp up
5691.12 their level of internal autonomic arousal,
5693.81 meaning to get really energized
5695.75 and kind of lean into
the friction of the cold.
5698.34 And they find that easier.
5699.77 Other people distract themselves,
5701.23 they recite the alphabet,
5702.33 or they do something, anything to try
5705.16 and distract themselves
from the discomfort.
5708.1 To be totally honest,
5709.11 it does not matter for
sake of dopamine release.
5712.07 Because the dopamine release is triggered
5714.11 and then continues even after
you get out of the cold water.
5717.94 Now, in this study, it was
long exposure to cold water.
5722.44 It was an hour.
5723.516 That's a long period of time.
5725.61 And I do warn you against
getting into cold water
5728.897 that's so cold that it will
make your temperature drop
5732.21 and make you hyperthermic for an hour.
5733.83 That actually could be
dangerous for a lot of people.
5735.54 You might have a hard time reheating,
5737.0 and hypothermia is not a good thing.
5739.57 They had people monitoring
subjects in these studies
5743.01 and paying attention to
their core body temperature.
5745.28 They were able to reheat them afterwards.
5747.87 It's well-established now
that getting into cold water,
5751.25 whether or not it's a shower,
5752.24 an ice bath circulating cold
water, a stream, et cetera,
5756.5 that can evoke the norepinephrine
release immediately,
5759.41 and the long arc of that dopamine release.
5761.62 Why would that be good?
5762.72 Up until now, I've basically
said getting increases
5765.63 in dopamine are detrimental
to your baseline.
5769.37 Well, this does appear to
raise the baseline of dopamine
5772.44 for substantial periods of time.
5773.98 And most people report feeling
a heightened level of calm
5778.92 and focus after getting out of cold water.
5782.1 So cold water exposure turns out
5783.53 to be a very potent stimulus for shifting
5786.25 the entire milieu,
5787.36 the entire environment
of our brain and body
5790.56 and allowing many people
to feel much, much better
5794.709 for a substantial period of time
5796.8 after getting out of the ice
bath or cold water of any kind
5800.6 than they did before.
5802.18 Now, you might ask how often to do this?
5804.37 Some people do this every day.
5806.02 It can be very stimulating.
5807.3 So typically doing it early in the day,
5810.01 it's going to be better.
5810.843 I don't necessarily recommend
doing it right before sleep,
5813.73 but some people do it in the afternoon.
5815.63 And some people will indeed
do that seven days a week,
5818.53 other people three days a week,
5819.68 other people every once in a while.
5821.25 What I can say is once you
become cold water adapted,
5825.33 once it no longer has the
same impact of novelty
5829.15 and feeling a bit like a,
5830.95 I don't want to say a
shock to your system,
5832.28 'cause you don't want to
go into cold water shock,
5833.79 but once it is comfortable for you,
5837.99 then it will no longer evoke this release.
5840.28 There really does seem to
be something in the pathway
5842.38 from cold water exposure through
the norepinephrine pathway
5845.5 and into the mesolimbic brainstem
5847.29 that causes this release in dopamine.
5849.4 But nonetheless, it's
a basically zero cost.
5852.6 I mean, you need access
to water of some sort,
5854.42 cold water shower, et cetera,
5855.62 but basically zero cost way
of triggering a long lasting
5859.01 increase in dopamine
without ingesting anything,
5861.05 no pharmacology whatsoever.
5862.81 Please again, approach it with
a safety and caution in mind,
5866.03 but it is a very potent stimulus.
5867.95 Again, 250% of a rise in baseline,
5871.383 two and a half times
rise in baseline rivals
5873.93 that of cocaine which
is really remarkable.
5876.8 Now, I'd like to talk
about the positive aspects
5878.98 of rewards for our behavior,
5880.46 and the negative aspects of
rewards for our behavior.
5883.05 And from that, I will suggest a protocol
5886.09 by which you can achieve
a better relationship
5889.24 to your activities and
to your dopamine system.
5892.09 In fact, it will help tune
up your dopamine system
5894.53 for discipline, hard work and motivation.
5900.39 Hard work is hard.
5902.6 Generally, most people
don't like working hard.
5906.05 Some people do,
5907.06 but most people work hard in
order to achieve some end goal.
5912.76 End goals are terrific
and rewards are terrific
5914.95 whether or not they are
monetary social or any kind.
5919.91 However, because of the
way that dopamine relates
5923.87 to our perception of time,
5926.468 working hard at something
for sake of a reward
5930.55 that comes afterward,
5932.35 can make the hard work
much more challenging
5935.74 and make us much less likely
to lean into hard work
5938.88 in the future.
5939.87 Let me give you a couple
examples by way of data
5942.49 and experiments.
5943.87 There's a classic experiment
done actually at Stanford
5947.67 many years ago in which
children in nursery school
5952.02 and kindergarten drew pictures,
5954.87 and they drew pictures
cause they like to draw.
5957.73 The researchers took
kids that liked to draw
5960.69 and they started giving
them a reward for drawing.
5963.58 The reward generally was a gold star
5965.61 or some thing that a young
child would find rewarding.
5970.23 Then they stopped giving
them the gold star.
5973.52 And what they found is the children
5975.7 had a much lower tendency
to draw on their own.
5981.15 No reward.
5982.15 Now, remember this was an activity
5984.33 that prior to receiving a reward,
5986.49 the children intrinsically
enjoyed and selected to do.
5990.503 No one was telling them to draw.
5992.529 What this relates to
is so-called intrinsic
5994.56 versus extrinsic reinforcement.
5997.29 When we receive rewards,
5998.84 even if we give ourselves
rewards for something,
6002.01 we tend to associate less
pleasure with the actual activity
6005.52 itself that evoked the reward.
6007.99 Now, that might seem counterintuitive,
6009.47 but that's just way that the way
6010.7 that these dopaminergic circuits work.
6013.29 And now understanding these
peaks in baselines in dopamine
6016.67 which I won't review again,
6018.67 this should make sense.
6020.34 If you get a peak in
dopamine from a reward,
6024.31 it's going to lower your baseline
6025.78 and the cognitive interpretation
6029.09 is that you didn't really do the activity
6031.57 because you enjoyed the activity.
6032.81 You did it for the reward.
6034.45 Now, this doesn't mean all
rewards of all kinds are bad,
6037.36 but it's also important to understand
6039.79 that dopamine controls
our perception of time.
6042.82 When and how much dopamine we experience
6046.24 is the way that we carve up
6048.2 what we call our experience of time.
6050.58 When we engage in an activity,
6052.17 let's say school or hard work of any kind
6055.03 or exercise because of the reward
6058.24 we are going to give ourselves
a receive at the end,
6060.31 the trophy, the sundae, the
meal, whatever it happens to be.
6066.9 We actually are extending the time bin
6070.54 over which we are analyzing
or perceiving that experience.
6076.04 And because the reward comes at the end,
6079.4 we start to dissociate the neural circuits
6082.86 for dopamine reward that would
have normally been active
6086.39 during the activity.
6088.62 And because it all arrives
at the end over time,
6092.92 we have the experience
of less and less pleasure
6095.84 from that particular activity
while we're doing it.
6099.22 Now, this is the antithesis
of growth mindset.
6103.16 My colleague at Stanford, Carol
Dweck, as many of you know,
6105.83 has come up with this
incredible theory and principle,
6109.08 and actually goes beyond
theory and principle
6110.97 called "Growth Mindset",
6112.02 which is this striving to be
better to be in this mindset
6115.17 of I'm not there yet,
6116.79 but striving itself is the end goal.
6120.93 And that of course delivers
you to tremendous performance.
6123.36 It's been observed over
and over and over again,
6125.19 that people that have growth mindset,
6126.61 kids that have growth mindset
end up performing very well
6129.47 because they're focused
on the effort itself.
6131.69 And all of us can
cultivate growth mindset.
6135.57 The neural mechanism of
cultivating growth mindset
6138.2 involves learning to access
the rewards from effort
6142.65 and doing.
6143.81 And that's hard to do
because you have to engage
6147.91 this prefrontal component
of the mesolimbic circuit.
6150.39 You have to tell yourself,
okay, this effort is great,
6153.7 this effort is pleasureful.
6155.22 Even though you might
actually be in a state
6156.8 of physical pain from the exercise,
6158.46 or I can recall this from college,
6160.14 just feeling like I wanted
to get up from my desk,
6162.28 but forcing myself to study,
6163.69 forcing myself and forcing myself.
6165.18 What you find over time is
that you can start to associate
6168.45 a dopamine release.
6169.41 You can evoke dopamine
release from the friction
6173.07 and the challenge that
you happen to be in.
6175.85 You completely eliminate
the ability to generate
6179.61 those circuits and the
rewarding process of being able
6182.85 to reward friction while in effort,
6186.08 if you are focused only on the
goal that comes at the end.
6189.58 Because of the way that
dopamine marks time.
6192.54 So if you say, oh, I'm going
to do this very hard thing,
6195.46 and I'm going to push and
push and push and push
6197.38 for that end goal that comes later.
6200.31 Not only do you enjoy the process
of what you're doing less,
6205.02 you actually make it more painful
6207.09 while you're engaging in it.
6208.56 You make yourself less efficient at it,
6210.32 because if you were able to
access dopamine while in effort,
6213.54 dopamine has all these
incredible properties
6215.39 of increasing the amount
of energy in our body,
6217.98 and in our mind, our ability to focus
6219.91 by way of dopamines
conversion into epinephrin.
6223.25 But also you're undermining
your ability to lean back
6227.29 into that activity the next time.
6228.58 The next time you need
twice as much coffee
6231.52 and three times as much loud music,
6233.72 and four times as much energy drink
6235.75 and the social connection
just to get out the door
6238.4 in order to do the run or to study.
6240.77 So what's more beneficial
in fact can serve
6244.83 as a tremendous amplifier on all endeavors
6247.68 that you engage in.
6249.4 Especially hard endeavors is to A,
6252.76 not start layering in
other sources of dopamine
6255.69 in order to get to the starting line,
6257.53 not layering in other sources of dopamine
6259.99 in order to be able to continue,
6261.25 but rather to subjectively start to attach
6264.64 the feeling of friction and effort
6267.55 to an internally generated reward system.
6270.36 And this is not meant to be vague,
6272.41 this is a system that exists in your mind,
6275.16 that exists in the minds of humans
6277.04 for hundreds of thousands of years,
6278.94 by which you're not
just pursuing the things
6281.78 that are innately pleasureful,
6283.77 food, sex, warmth, water
when you're thirsty.
6287.9 But the beauty of this
mesolimbic reward pathway
6291.22 that I talked about earlier is that,
6293.24 it includes the forebrain.
6294.42 So you can tell yourself the
effort part is the good part.
6299.27 I know it's painful,
6300.11 I know this doesn't feel good,
6301.3 but I'm focused on this.
6302.43 I'm going to start to access the reward.
6304.99 You will find the rewards,
6307.041 meaning the dopamine
release inside of effort
6310.09 if you repeat this over and over again.
6311.788 And what's beautiful about it is that,
6314.04 it starts to become reflexive
for all types of effort.
6317.47 When we focus only on the trophy,
6319.32 only on the grade,
6320.32 only on the win as the reward,
6323.0 you undermine that entire process.
6325.55 So how do you do this?
6327.44 You do this in those moments
of the most intense friction.
6331.47 You tell yourself this is very painful
6334.67 and because it's painful,
6336.95 it will evoke an increase
in dopamine release later,
6340.63 meaning it will increase
my baseline in dopamine,
6343.95 but you also have to tell yourself
6346.58 that in that moment you
are doing it by choice
6350.49 and you're doing it because you love it.
6353.68 And I know that sounds
like lying to yourself,
6356.12 and in some ways it is lying to yourself,
6358.43 but it's lying to yourself
in the context of a truth
6361.31 which is that you want it to feel better.
6365.07 You want it to feel even pleasureful.
6367.82 Now, this is very far and away different
6370.85 from thinking about the
reward that comes at the end,
6374.33 the hot fudge sundae for after
you cross the finish line
6377.04 and you can replace hot fudge sundae
6378.37 with whatever reward happens
to be appealing to you.
6382.03 We revere people who are capable of doing
6384.01 what I'm describing.
6385.84 David Goggins comes to mind
is a really good example.
6388.09 Many of you are probably
familiar with David Goggins,
6390.22 former Navy SEAL who essentially
6392.67 has made a post-military
career out of explaining
6398.21 and sharing his process
of turning the effort
6400.95 into the reward.
6402.67 There are many other examples
of this too, of course.
6406.85 Throughout evolutionary history,
6408.77 there's no question that we revered people
6410.63 who were willing to go out
and forage and hunt and gather
6413.97 and caretake in ways that other members
6417.94 of our species probably found exhausting
6420.29 and probably would have preferred
to just put their feet up
6422.77 or soaked them in a cool stream
6424.06 rather than continue to forage.
6426.1 The ability to access
this pleasure from effort
6430.89 aspect of our dopaminergic circuitry
6433.36 is without question the most
powerful aspect of dopamine
6437.407 and our biology of dopamine.
6439.57 And the beautiful thing is
it's accessible to all of us.
6443.07 But just to highlight the
things that can interfere with,
6445.99 and prevent you from
getting dopamine release
6449.94 from effort itself,
6452.17 don't spike dopamine prior
to engaging in effort.
6455.559 And don't spike dopamine
after engaging in effort,
6459.47 learn to spike your
dopamine from effort itself.
6463.02 One straightforward example
of learning to attach dopamine
6467.51 to effort and strain
as opposed to a process
6471.87 or a reward that naturally
evokes dopamine release
6475.29 is so-called intermittent fasting.
6477.15 I know this is very popular nowadays.
6479.54 Some people like to do
intermittent fasting,
6481.19 some people don't.
6482.35 Some people have a 12 hour
feeding window every 24 hours,
6485.2 some people do long fasts
of two to three days even.
6488.3 I personally don't
monitor a feeding window
6491.6 with a lot of precision.
6492.69 I tend to skip one meal a day,
6494.08 either breakfast or lunch,
6495.4 and then I eat the other
two meals of the day
6496.89 depending on which meal I skipped.
6498.16 So it's either breakfast, lunch
6499.78 and maybe a little
something in the evening,
6502.32 or I'll skip breakfast and do
lunch and dinner and so on.
6505.73 Many people are now
eating this way in part,
6508.8 because many people find
it easier to not eat at all
6512.95 than to eat a smaller
portion of some food.
6516.02 And that has everything to
do with the dopamine reward
6519.38 evoking properties of food.
6522.05 When we ingest food or when
we are about to ingest food,
6525.98 our dopamine levels go up.
6527.21 And typically when we ingest food,
6529.35 if it evokes some dopamine release,
6531.04 then we tend to want even more food.
6532.73 Remember dopamine's main
role is one of motivation
6536.01 and seeking.
6536.843 And what dopamine always wants
more of is more dopamine.
6541.08 More activity or thing that
evokes more dopamine release.
6545.22 Well, let's just look at fasting
6547.98 from the perspective of dopamine schedules
6550.427 and dopamine release
and peaks and baselines.
6554.8 Typically, when we eat
we get dopamine release,
6558.85 especially when we eat
after being very hungry.
6561.55 If you've ever gone camping,
6562.61 or you're very, very hungry,
6564.22 the food tastes that much better.
6566.11 And that's actually because of the way
6568.11 that deprivation states increase the way
6572.84 that dopaminergic circuits work.
6575.11 Our perception of dopamine is heightened
6578.58 when the receptors for dopamine
6580.36 have not seen much dopamine lately,
6582.47 they haven't bound much dopamine.
6583.89 So when you fast, fast, fast, fast, fast,
6585.8 and then you finally eat,
6587.91 it evokes more dopamine release.
6589.69 So this is the big reward
that comes at the end.
6592.9 Even bigger because you deprived yourself.
6596.25 This is true for all rewarding
behaviors and activities
6599.04 by the way.
6600.25 The longer you restrict
yourself from that activity,
6603.0 the greater the dopamine
experience when the dopamine
6606.02 is finally released,
6606.853 because of an upregulation of
the receptors for dopamine.
6610.85 but I just spent five
minutes or more telling you
6613.47 that you should avoid too
much reward at the end,
6616.47 and you should actually
focus on the dopamine
6619.83 that you can consciously evoke
from the deprivation strain
6624.19 and effort.
6625.023 And in fact, this is what
happens for many people
6628.11 that start doing fasting
and take a liking to it.
6631.19 Many people say that their state of mind
6634.01 when they fast is clearer,
6635.95 that they actually start to
enjoy the period of fasting.
6639.11 In fact, some people start
pushing out their eating window
6641.87 or skipping entire days
of eating more and more
6644.25 in order to get deeper
into that state of mind
6647.605 where surely it's not just dopamine,
6650.53 but dopamine is released.
6651.95 They will track their clock.
6653.39 Oh, I've been fasting 12
hours, 16 hours, et cetera.
6656.04 They are starting to
attach dopamine release
6658.47 or create dopamine release
from the deprivation,
6661.48 not from the food reward itself.
6663.46 And this I think makes it
an interesting practice.
6666.27 And one that certainly has
been practiced by for centuries
6670.26 in different cultures
and different religions
6672.25 of deliberately restricting food,
6674.29 not just to increase
the rewarding properties
6676.56 of food itself,
6678.02 but also to increase
the rewarding properties
6680.55 of deprivation.
6682.09 And I should emphasize that a
lot of the subjective aspects
6685.08 of the knowledge of
the benefits of fasting
6687.51 serve as reinforcing dopamine
amplifying aspects to fasting,
6693.16 meaning if somebody does
intermittent fasting
6696.61 and they are deep into their fast
6698.38 and they're telling themselves,
6699.28 oh, my blood lipid profiles
are probably improving.
6701.92 And my glucose management
is probably improving.
6704.5 My insulin sensitivity is going up,
6706.31 and I'm going to live longer.
6707.21 All these things that have
some basis from animal studies
6711.01 and some basis or not from human studies,
6713.77 it's all kind of still
an emerging literature,
6715.81 but it does seem to be
pointing in that direction
6717.65 that fasting can encourage
things like autophagy,
6721.507 the engulfment of dead cells
and things of that sort.
6724.56 Well, as people tell
themselves these things,
6727.8 they are enhancing the
rewarding properties
6730.98 of the behavior of fasting.
6732.88 And so this is a salient example
6735.0 of where knowledge of
knowledge can actually help us
6738.86 change these deep primitive
circuits related to dopamine.
6743.06 And this illustrates how the forebrain,
6745.49 which carries knowledge
and carries interpretation
6748.29 and rational thought can be
used to shape the very circuits
6752.72 that are involved in generating reward
6755.3 for what would otherwise
just be kind of primitive
6757.44 behaviors, hardwired behaviors.
6759.11 And that's the beauty of
these dopamine circuits.
6761.38 That's the beauty of dopamine.
6762.57 It's not just attached to the
more primitive of food, sex,
6767.28 heat, et cetera.
6769.52 It's also attached to the things
6771.53 that we decide are good for
us and are important for us.
6774.71 So telling yourself
that exercise or fasting
6777.38 or studying or listening better
6780.21 or any kind of behavior is good for you
6781.82 will actually reinforce the extent
6784.68 to which it is good for
you at a chemical level.
6788.05 And a somewhat eerie example
of what I just mentioned
6791.69 was a study that was published last year
6793.79 in the journal Neuron, Cell Press journal,
6795.48 excellent journal.
6796.78 That showed that hearing something
6800.22 that reinforces one's prior beliefs
6802.96 actually can evoke dopamine release.
6805.43 So the dopamine pathway is so vulnerable
6808.49 to subjective interpretation
6810.69 that it actually makes it such
that when we see something
6813.62 or hear something that validates a belief
6815.74 that we already have,
6816.88 that itself can increase dopamine release.
6820.6 Along the lines of how
dopamine and dopamine schedules
6824.18 and our perception of
things can shape the way
6826.66 that we experience things
as pleasureful or not.
6829.701 There are beautiful studies
mainly looking at sugar appetite
6833.37 and our sense of pleasure
from sweet things,
6835.9 but also for savory foods, et cetera.
6838.69 And essentially the results that come out
6840.32 of this are the following.
6841.58 If you ingest something that you like,
6843.85 it tastes good to you,
6845.12 but then you ingest
something that's even sweeter
6847.93 or even more savory.
6849.67 And then you go back to the
food that you ate previously.
6853.57 Well, you don't like it as much,
6855.61 and that might seem like a duh, obviously.
6858.35 But that shift in
perception can be blocked
6862.6 by blocking the shift in dopamine.
6865.18 And so this really speaks
to these peaks and valleys
6868.19 in dopamine that I mentioned before
6869.53 and how your experience of
anything is going to depend
6873.08 on your prior experience of other things
6875.92 that evoke dopamine.
6876.88 Big dopamine release
makes it more challenging
6879.87 to experience more big dopamine release.
6883.02 So dopamine is one of those things
6884.313 that you don't want too high
or too low for too long.
6887.86 It's all about staying
in that dynamic range
6890.14 and that's going to be
different for everybody.
6892.51 So for the very savory foods
that are now everywhere,
6897.95 those highly savory foods
6899.583 or I think they call them
highly palatable foods
6902.19 are making more bland foods, whole foods,
6906.04 meaning foods that aren't processed.
6907.44 It's making those tastes less
good at least for a while.
6910.18 And all it takes is a short
period of time, even just days,
6913.53 two days or so of not consuming
any highly palatable foods
6917.95 and suddenly broccoli with
just a little bit of seasoning
6922.45 tastes delicious to you.
6923.85 All right?
6924.683 So again, this just speaks
to the fact that dopamine
6927.22 is this universal currency.
6929.17 It establishes value based on,
6931.6 not just what you're
experiencing in the moment,
6933.23 but what you experienced in
the days and minutes before.
6936.63 Now, that you understand
how your previous level
6939.62 of dopamine relates to your
current level of dopamine,
6942.71 and how your current level
of dopamine will influence
6946.1 your future level of dopamine,
6948.51 it should become obvious
why things like pornography,
6952.59 not just the accessibility of pornography,
6954.7 but the intensity of
pornography can negatively shape
6959.67 real world romantic and
sexual interactions.
6962.72 This is a serious concern.
6964.05 The discussion is happening now.
6966.21 The underlying neurobiological mechanisms
6968.3 you now understand.
6969.84 And this isn't to pass judgment on whether
6971.89 or not people like or
don't like pornography,
6974.78 that's an ethical discussion,
6975.94 and it's a moral discussion
that has to be decided
6978.05 for each individual by
virtue of age, et cetera.
6982.53 But again, any activity that evokes
6986.17 a lot of dopamine release
will make it harder
6989.86 to achieve the same level and
certainly the greater level
6993.75 of dopamine through a
subsequent interaction.
6996.89 So yes, indeed many people
are addicted to pornography
7000.44 and yes, indeed many people
who regularly indulge
7004.53 in pornography experienced challenges
7006.84 in real-world romantic interactions.
7009.14 You now understand the mechanisms behind
7010.91 what I'm telling you.
7012.3 Now, there are circumstances
in which increasing levels
7015.08 of dopamine is desirable and advantageous
7017.87 and clinically helpful.
7019.41 Good example of this would
be the drug Welbutrin
7021.77 also called bupropion
which increases dopamine
7024.61 and norepinephrine.
7026.16 Wellbutrin bupropion was developed
7027.84 as an alternative treatment for depression
7030.22 because some people who
take the so-called SSRI,
7032.88 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
7035.61 which as the name suggests
increased serotonin
7037.86 suffer from serotonin
related side effects.
7041.38 Things like decreased
appetite, decreased libido,
7044.78 or sometimes increased
appetite or other side effects
7048.85 that they don't want.
7050.4 And Wellbutrin seems to avoid
the sexual side effects.
7054.24 It can blunt at appetite
and these sorts of things
7058.5 because of the increase in
norepinephrine and dopamine
7061.88 increases levels of
motivation and craving,
7064.53 but also can create a
state of elevated alertness
7069.16 that can sometimes get in
the way of healthy eating
7072.16 and things of that sort.
7072.993 So one has to work with their
clinician as psychiatrist.
7076.68 It is a prescription drug in order
7078.28 to find the dosage of Welbutrin
that's correct for them.
7081.86 In addition, things
like Welbutrin bupropion
7084.44 can increase anxiety because
of the way that dopamine
7086.977 and norepinephrine are stimulating
7089.08 and tend to place people
into heightened levels
7090.96 of alertness.
7091.793 Nonetheless, many people
have gained terrific relief
7094.68 from depression from Wellbutrin bupropion,
7097.378 and many of those same
people had serious trouble
7099.81 with some of the SSRI.
7101.09 So it does seem to be a very useful drug
7103.21 in certain contexts,
7104.043 both for depression and for
the treatment of smoking
7106.85 for people desiring to quit smoking.
7109.18 And of course there are
a lot of people out there
7111.25 who are seeking to increase
their baseline levels
7113.55 of dopamine without
taking any prescription
7116.81 pharmaceutical compounds.
7118.7 And nowadays there exist a
lot of supplements to do that.
7122.44 The two most common ones that are directly
7124.79 within the dopamine
pathway are Macuna Pruriens
7128.45 which is actually a velvety
bean whose contents are l-DOPA.
7134.37 Believe it or not, the
content of this being
7136.32 is the precursor to dopamine.
7138.63 So Macuna Pruriens is
sold over the counter
7141.52 at least in the United States.
7143.21 And it literally is the
precursor to dopamine.
7147.11 Meaning if you take it,
7148.21 you will experience very
large increases in dopamine.
7151.19 Those increases are transient
and very, very intense.
7154.11 And in fact, if you look at
the constellation of effects
7157.81 of Macuna Pruriens,
7159.63 what you find is that
they're pretty striking
7161.51 and they look a lot like
if not identical to l-DOPA.
7165.68 The most obvious of
those is in the context
7168.4 of Parkinson's disease.
7169.69 There are at least five
studies that have shown
7171.78 that Macuna Pruriens
can reduce the symptoms
7175.19 of Parkinson's disease,
7176.25 much in the same way
that l-DOPA can reduce
7179.22 the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
7181.32 And that shouldn't come as any surprise
7182.96 given what I just told you
that is essentially l-DOPA.
7186.85 It also can reduce a particular
hormone called prolactin.
7190.28 Dopamine and prolactin
tend to be in somewhat
7192.86 push pull fashion.
7193.91 When dopamine is up,
7194.77 prolactin is down and vice versa.
7197.29 Prolactin is involved in
milk letdown in women.
7199.63 It's involved in setting
the refractory period
7202.33 for sex after ejaculation in males.
7206.04 The reason mating can
occur and then not occur
7208.59 after a ejaculation is because
of an increase in prolactin.
7211.12 Macuna Pruriens is often
used a blunt prolactin,
7214.95 and they're actually a
couple of studies showing
7217.06 that it can indeed do that.
7219.017 Macuna Pruriens has a
number of other effects
7221.8 that lie in the sex and
reproduction pathway
7224.93 that are worth noting.
7227.04 Sperm concentration, sperm quality
7229.69 is actually greatly
increased by Macuna Pruriens.
7232.56 These are kind of curious
effects until you understand
7234.672 a little bit more about
the biology of dopamine
7236.45 which I'll mention in a moment,
7237.94 but there are several studies,
7240.34 four in fact that describe
how Macuna Pruriens
7245.39 can increase sperm count, sperm quality,
7248.19 and sperm motility.
7249.68 So for those of you seeking
to conceive children,
7251.97 Macuna Pruriens might
be an interesting choice
7254.98 if you're interested in exploring
7256.51 non-prescription compounds.
7258.14 However, I should mention that any time
7261.93 you consume a substance
that increases dopamine
7266.08 by mimicking dopamine or
acting as a direct precursor
7269.52 to dopamine,
7270.65 there's almost inevitably
a crash or a reduction
7275.08 in the baseline in dopamine
that we referred to previously.
7278.69 So many people who take Macuna Pruriens
7280.81 feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert,
7284.89 all the sorts of things
that one would expect
7286.66 from a dopaminergic drug
which Macuna Pruriens is.
7290.44 And then they feel a low
or a reduction in drive
7294.537 and excitement and enthusiasm
after the drug wears off.
7298.19 Just like they would with other dopamine
7300.74 increasing compound.
7302.0 For that reason, many people have turned
7305.37 to the use of L-tyrosine.
7307.39 L-tyrosine is an amino
acid precursor to l-DOPA.
7310.8 So it lies further up the
dopamine synthesis pathway.
7314.2 And nowadays it's very
common because all L-tyrosine
7317.57 is sold over the counter
in the United States
7320.09 that people will take L-tyrosine as a way
7322.89 to get more energized alert and focused.
7326.31 Indeed, there are data that
L-tyrosine will accomplish that.
7330.5 L-tyrosine is typically
taken in capsule form
7333.2 or powder form anywhere from 500 to 750
7336.537 to a 1000 milligrams.
7338.54 It is a potent stimulus
for increasing dopamine.
7341.88 And the timescale for increasing dopamine
7343.73 is about 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion.
7346.53 Dopamine levels start to peak.
7348.38 The classic study that really nailed down
7351.31 the fact that tyrosine has this effect
7354.04 was published way back in 1983,
7356.77 Journal of Clinical
Endocrinology and Metabolism
7359.56 that directly compared
L-tyrosine supplementation
7362.95 with tryptophan ingestion on
plasma dopamine and serotonin.
7368.44 Tryptophan being a precursor to serotonin.
7371.36 And indeed what they found is
that ingestion of L-tyrosine
7375.03 can increase the amount of
dopamine circulating in the blood
7378.83 and in the brain too, of course.
7382.117 The L-tyrosine ingestion induced dopamine
7384.19 increases within 45 minutes
and they were short-lasting
7387.67 after about 30 minutes
the effect had dissipated,
7390.99 meaning the levels of dopamine
had dropped down to baseline.
7393.97 And even though they didn't look at levels
7396.1 of baseline dopamine past that time point,
7399.19 the expectation based
on everything we know
7401.64 about dopamine biology is
that it would then drop
7404.19 below baseline due to the depletion
7407.28 of the readily reservable
pool of dopamine vesicles
7409.93 that we talked about way
back at the beginning
7411.71 of this episode.
7413.36 The nice thing about this study
is it does show specificity
7415.8 of effect because ingestion of tryptophan
7418.32 did not increase dopamine
instead it increased serotonin.
7422.35 So there's really
specificity of these pathways
7424.3 that rule out any placebo type effects.
7428.21 I'm not suggesting that anybody, everybody
7431.16 increase their dopamine
levels by way of tyrosine
7433.617 or Macuna Pruriens.
7435.617 For those of you that
are seeking to increase
7437.5 your dopamine levels
without prescription drugs,
7439.82 those are the most direct route to that.
7441.95 Of course, if you have a pre-existing
7444.14 dopaminergic condition,
7445.48 so schizophrenia or psychosis of any kind,
7448.68 bipolar, anxiety,
7451.61 things like Macuna Pruriens and L-tyrosine
7454.12 will not be good for you.
7455.91 And if you don't, you should
just understand and expect
7459.99 that it's going to lead to
an increase in dopamine.
7463.38 You'll certainly feel an elevated state
7465.19 for some of you that might be agitating,
7467.86 for some of you that might
be really pleasureful,
7469.63 and then you will feel a crash afterwards.
7471.92 How deep is that crash will
really depend on your biology
7475.16 and where your dopamine baseline began.
7478.35 So I personally am not
a fan of using things
7481.07 like Macuna Pruriens at all for myself
7483.66 for the reasons I mentioned earlier,
7485.72 just too intense and too much of a crash.
7488.33 I do use L-tyrosine from time to time
7490.73 for enhancing focus and motivation,
7492.5 but I want to emphasize from time to time.
7495.23 So I might use it once a week,
occasionally twice a week,
7498.52 but I've never been one to
take L-tyrosine regularly
7501.37 in order to focus or train or
do any kind of mental work.
7504.93 I just don't want to rely
on any exogenous substance
7508.97 in order to get my dopamine
circuits activated.
7512.36 And I don't want to experience
the drop in dopamine
7515.16 that inevitably occurs some
period of time afterwards.
7518.47 I should also mention
things that can reduce
7521.378 your levels of baseline dopamine.
7523.98 One that is rarely discussed is melatonin.
7527.64 I have talked before on this
podcast about melatonin,
7530.51 why I am not a fan of using melatonin
7533.25 in order to enhance sleep.
7535.14 It can help one get to sleep,
7536.46 but not stay asleep.
7537.69 Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert
7539.33 from University of California, Berkeley.
7541.43 I think I don't want to
put words in his mouth,
7543.89 but in our discussion about
melatonin on this podcast
7548.65 when Matt was a guest in his
book and on other podcasts,
7551.43 Matt has generally stated
that the use of melatonin
7554.69 except for treatment of jet lag
7556.62 is generally not a good idea.
7558.29 And I agree.
7559.77 I think that melatonin is
not often thought about
7563.21 as impacting the dopamine pathway,
7564.84 but there's at least one
study published in 2001
7568.72 first author is Nishiyama
just as it sounds.
7572.55 It's spelled just as it sounds.
7574.51 Acute effects of melatonin administration
7576.47 on cardiovascular autonomic
regulation in healthy men.
7579.05 So the study wasn't
specifically about dopamine,
7581.84 but they looked at norepinephrine
and dopamine levels,
7584.2 and they found a statistically
significant decrease
7588.75 in dopamine 60 minutes after
melatonin administration.
7592.73 I've talked before about
how viewing bright lights
7596.09 between the hours of
10:00 p.m and 4:00 a.m
7598.21 has been shown in studies
by Dr. Samer Hattar,
7600.54 David Bersin, excellent
circadian scientists
7604.31 to reduce levels of
dopamine for several days
7607.03 after that light exposure.
7608.32 So dim the lights at night,
7610.46 if you can avoid exogenous melatonin,
7613.72 meaning if you don't
have to take melatonin
7616.29 and you can find a better alternative
7618.12 that would be a good idea
7618.98 if you want to maintain
healthy levels of dopamine.
7621.73 Now, there is one compound
that you are all familiar with,
7624.51 and you've probably actually
taken without realizing it,
7627.58 that increases dopamine.
7628.81 And that's something called
PEA for phenethylamine,
7633.02 technically beta phenethylamine.
7636.11 And PEA is found in various foods.
7639.21 Chocolate just happens to
be one in enriched in PEA
7643.05 and can increase synaptic
levels of dopamine.
7646.75 I personally take PEA from time to time
7649.65 as a focus and work aid
in order to do intense
7654.44 bouts of work.
7655.43 Again, I don't do that too often.
7656.89 This might be once a week
or once every two weeks.
7659.33 I might use it for training,
7660.42 but typically I don't,
7661.72 it's usually for mental work.
7663.08 And I will take 500 milligrams of PEA
7666.21 and I'll take 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC.
7669.26 That's something that I personally do.
7670.84 That's what's right for me,
7671.88 it's within my margins
of safety for my health.
7674.37 Again, you have to check
with your doctor and decide
7676.52 what's right for you.
7677.96 It leads to a sharp but very
transient increase in dopamine
7682.54 that lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.
7685.53 And at least in my system
I've found to be much more
7689.41 regulated and kind of even
than something like L-tyrosine
7693.31 and certainly much more regulated and even
7695.64 and lower dopamine release than something
7698.01 like Macuna Pruriens.
7700.24 One of the lesser talked about
compounds that's out there,
7702.87 but that's gaining popularity
for increasing dopamine
7706.56 and as a so-called nootropic is something
7708.76 called huperzine A.
7710.26 Huperzine A is a compound
sold over the counter
7713.82 at least in the United States
7715.21 that can increase
acetylcholine transmission,
7718.13 a different neuromodulator entirely.
7720.41 But what's interesting is
that huperzine A somehow
7723.7 by way of interactions
between the cholinergic system
7726.68 and the dopaminergic system
leads to increases in dopamine
7731.06 in the medial prefrontal
cortex and hippocampus.
7733.69 Hippocampus, of course,
being an area of the brain
7735.65 associated with learning and memory.
7737.2 And prefrontal cortex being associated
7739.01 with the mesolimbic pathway,
decision-making focus,
7741.48 et cetera.
7742.313 And so I think the reason
why we're seeing an increase
7744.63 in popularity of companies
including huperzine A
7747.847 and nootropic compounds is
both for the cholinergic
7751.22 stimulating properties,
7752.17 but also for stimulating dopamine release.
7755.56 I personally have never tried huperzine A.
7757.55 You can go to www.examine.com
or put huperzine A
7760.65 into PubMed if you'd like to search around
7762.71 and see some of the science behind it.
7764.4 Again, I'm not recommending
anyone take these things.
7766.34 In fact, I recommend against
anyone just diving in,
7768.51 and starting to consume things
without gaining knowledge
7771.21 about how they function,
7772.49 whether or not they're right for you.
7773.97 But nonetheless, I think
in the years to come,
7776.11 we are going to see a
lot more of L-tyrosine,
7779.35 PEA phenethylamine and
huperzine as a way of tapping
7783.33 into the dopaminergic
and cholinergic circuits
7786.01 certainly along with things like Alpha-GPC
7788.39 as non-prescription, short-lived
7790.9 somewhat milder alternatives to things
7794.25 that really spike dopamine,
7796.38 things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil
7799.51 and similar.
7800.65 And I can't help but share
with you one more result.
7802.94 It's not related to pharmacology.
7804.95 It's related to behaviors
and social interactions.
7808.58 And that's the very interesting
7810.27 and I would say important finding
7812.36 that was made a few years ago
by my colleague, Rob Malenka,
7815.403 who's in our department
of psychiatry at Stanford,
7817.56 showing that oxytocin
and social connection
7820.85 is actually directly stimulating
the dopamine pathway.
7824.8 I think for many years,
7826.41 all of us including me
would hear and thought
7830.32 that oxytocin was in
the serotonergic pathway
7833.81 that it was about pair bonding,
7835.34 and it was about some
of these neuromodulators
7837.43 that were more associated
with things related
7840.12 to feeling good with what we
have in the present moment.
7843.53 That's typically what we
think of when we think
7845.02 of the opioid system or
the serotonergic system.
7848.11 The dopamine system is really
about seeking and reward,
7850.96 but in a paper published in
2017 in the journal Science,
7853.84 excellent journal.
7856.27 The papers titled gaining of
social reward by oxytocin,
7860.07 excuse me, in the ventral tegmental area.
7862.61 You now know what the
ventral tegmental area,
7864.17 it's that area of the mesolimbic pathway.
7866.32 What this paper
essentially showed is that,
7868.58 oxytocin social connection
and pair bonding itself
7873.16 triggers dopamine release.
7875.03 And as everyone read this
result, we all realized,
7878.44 ah, this makes total sense
that for the evolution
7881.92 of our species,
7882.753 indeed for any species
where social connections
7885.18 are important,
7886.68 it's also important to go
seek social connections.
7889.27 And so, while it's fun to
think about pharmacology
7891.61 and underlying neurocircuitry
and cold water baths
7894.94 and all these different things
related to dopamine schedules
7898.53 and reward mechanisms and
attaching reward to effort
7901.35 and all the various things
that we've talked about today
7903.39 in terms of science and
tools and protocols,
7906.73 I'd be remiss if I didn't include
description of this result
7909.75 and just emphasize that
social connections,
7913.78 close social connections in particular
7915.9 that evoke oxytocin release.
7917.38 So those are romantic type,
7919.21 those are parent-child type,
7921.25 those are friendship related,
7922.77 and those can even be just
friends at a distance related,
7926.41 right?
7927.362 It doesn't actually require skin contact
7928.77 to get oxytocin release,
7931.37 but oxytocin release is
central to stimulating
7934.11 the dopamine pathways.
7935.95 So the take home message
there is quite simple,
7939.61 engage in pursue quality,
healthy social interactions.
7944.11 I know I've covered a
lot of material today.
7946.33 I've really tried hard to focus on things
7948.15 that lie directly within
the dopamine pathway
7951.3 and circuitries,
7952.72 as well as things that directly stimulate
7954.7 those pathways and circuitries.
7957.0 What I haven't talked
about are all the things
7959.6 that indirectly serve
the dopamine pathways.
7962.92 And out there on the internet
7964.37 and indeed in the scientific literature,
7966.4 you will find for instance,
7967.67 that things like Maca root
can increase dopamine.
7970.25 Things like the gut microbiome
can influence dopamine.
7973.55 And indeed they can,
7974.95 but they do that through
indirect mechanisms.
7977.07 By creating a environment,
7979.04 a milieu in which dopamine
and dopamine circuits
7982.2 can flourish.
7983.47 Maca is a good example of that.
7984.84 It will reduce cortisol and
through some indirect pathways
7988.2 related to cortisol can increase dopamine.
7990.89 But it's not a direct
increase in dopamine.
7993.1 And so as a consequence,
it's rather subtle
7995.21 compared to the various
compounds and behaviors
7997.43 that I talked about today.
7998.78 Indeed cold water exposure
leads to huge increases
8003.27 in dopamine as we talked about before,
8005.6 and very sustained ones at that.
8008.52 I realize in giving you a lot
of information about science
8011.75 and mechanism all the way
from psychological biological
8014.7 to circuitry and synaptic transmission,
8016.54 volumetric transmission and so forth,
8018.827 that it might seem overwhelming.
8020.77 The most important thing is to understand,
8022.59 or that these dopamine pathways
8023.84 really are under your control.
8025.93 And the locus of control
resides in the fact
8029.07 that your previous levels of dopamine
8031.33 are influencing your levels
of dopamine right now.
8034.1 And your current levels of dopamine
8035.6 and where you take them next,
8037.01 will influence your dopamine
levels in the next days
8039.32 and weeks to come.
8040.35 So I hope both with the mechanisms
that you now have in hand
8044.03 plus some of the tools to tap
into the dopaminergic system,
8046.76 both behavioral,
pharmacologic prescription,
8049.17 and non-prescription, et cetera,
8050.8 that you'll feel that
you have more control
8052.22 over your dopamine system.
8053.49 And certainly that you
have a better understanding
8055.53 of your dopamine system
so that you can modulate
8058.43 and adjust your levels
of dopamine in the ways
8060.34 that serve you best.

8118.35 Today and on previous podcast episodes
8120.5 we talked a bit about supplements.
8122.4 Supplements certainly aren't necessary,
8124.35 but many people find them beneficial
8125.98 for things like adjusting
their levels of dopamine
8127.97 or for other purposes.
8129.95 If you're going to use supplements,
8131.13 it's very important that
the supplements you use
8133.32 be of very high quality,
8134.69 and that the quantity of ingredients
8136.76 that are on the label match
8138.32 what's actually in those bottles.
8139.61 For that reason, we've
partnered with Thorne.
8141.3 T-H-O-R-N-E because Thorne
has the highest levels
8144.41 of stringency with respect to quality
8146.61 and how much of each supplement
they put in the products
8150.45 that they sell.
