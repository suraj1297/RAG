0.38 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.42 where we discuss science
3.427 and science-based tools for everyday life.
5.875 [gentle music]
9.22 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.17 and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
12.72 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.66 This podcast is separate
15.7 from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.
18.0 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
20.0 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
22.91 and science-related tools
to the general public.
25.61 In keeping with that theme,
26.71 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
29.58 Our first sponsor is Roka.
31.73 Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
33.73 that in my opinion are the
absolute best out there.
37.4 The sunglasses and eyeglasses
that are made by Roka
39.64 have a number of properties
that are really unique.
41.56 First of all, they're
extremely lightweight,
43.76 you never even notice
that they're on your face.
45.85 Second, the optical clarity is fantastic.
49.03 One of the things that's
really hard to accomplish,
50.95 but that Roka succeeded in accomplishing
53.22 is making sunglasses that you can wear
55.14 in lots of different environments.
56.95 As you move from bright to
shadowed regions for instance,
60.46 or as the amount of sunlight changes
62.8 many eyeglasses will make it such
64.41 that it's hard to see your environment
65.72 and you need to take the eyeglasses off,
67.29 or you can't see or detect borders.
69.06 With Roka sunglasses,
all of that is seamless,
72.03 they clearly understand
the adaptation mechanisms
75.96 and habituation mechanisms,
77.12 all these fancy details
about the human visual system
79.52 have allowed them to design a sunglass
81.67 that allows you to be in any environment
83.25 and to see that
environment extremely well.
86.53 The eyeglasses are terrific,
87.91 I wear readers at night
89.21 and again, they just make the
whole experience of reading
92.44 or working on a screen
at night very, very easy,
95.64 very easy on the eyes.
96.85 The aesthetic of the eyeglasses
98.12 and sunglasses is also suburb.
100.15 You know, I chuckle sometimes
101.25 when I see sports frames
or sports glasses,
103.58 a lot of them just look
ridiculous frankly,
105.58 but the Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
107.95 have a terrific aesthetic,
109.13 they have a huge variety to select from.
111.22 If you'd like to try Roka glasses,
112.76 you can go to Roka,
113.94 that's roka.com and
enter the code Huberman
117.32 and you'll get 20% off your first order,
119.54 that's roka.com and
enter the code Huberman
123.01 to get 20% off your first order.
125.23 Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
128.723 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
131.37 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
134.18 to help you better understand your body
135.77 and help you reach your health goals.
137.93 I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done
140.56 for the simple reason
that many of the factors
143.29 that impact your immediate
and long-term health
145.49 can only be detected from
a quality blood test.
148.95 One of the major problems
with blood tests however
151.36 is that oftentimes you'll
get information back
154.2 about levels of metabolic
factors, hormones, et cetera,
157.25 and there won't be any directives
158.65 about what to do with that information.
160.75 With InsideTracker, it
makes all of that very easy.
163.77 First of all, they can come to your home
165.48 to do the blood test and DNA test
167.21 or you can go to a local clinic,
169.48 they make that very easy.
170.78 Second of all, when you
get the information back
173.28 about the levels of hormones,
174.58 and metabolic factors, and
other things in your blood
177.03 it gives you simple directives.
178.35 They have a dashboard
that allows you to assess
181.07 for instance, whether or not
you ought to make changes
183.2 in your nutrition, or
changes in your exercise,
185.59 or changes in your sleep regimen,
187.34 any number of different lifestyle factors
189.02 that can help bring the
markers and the various factors
192.44 in your blood and DNA to
the appropriate levels.
195.54 So, really they're putting you
197.0 in the driver's seat for your health.
198.88 In fact, one of the
listeners of this podcast
201.52 contacted me recently and said
I took an InsideTracker test,
205.1 I felt like I was in great health,
206.66 but I noticed from the test
208.37 that I had high CRP, C-reactive protein.
211.15 C-reactive protein is a
marker that if it's too high
214.13 is a cautionary note
216.32 about various cardiac
and even eye diseases,
219.53 so it's something that they
are now taking actions on
222.39 as a consequence of getting
their blood work done
224.56 and taking the InsideTracker test.
225.94 So, I think that's just
one of many examples
228.36 that we hear about.
229.32 I have examples from my own life
230.62 for instance of different
factors in my blood being off
233.227 and making adjustments to nutrition
235.55 and other aspects of my life
236.68 that have allowed me to bring
those into the proper range.
239.22 So, if you care about your health
240.609 InsideTracker may very
well be right for you.
242.97 If you'd like to try InsideTracker
244.92 you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.
247.94 And if you do that, you'll get 25% off
250.07 any of InsideTracker's plans,
251.86 just use the code Huberman at checkout.
254.32 Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.
257.36 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,
259.58 mineral probiotic drink.
261.63 I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012
264.8 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
267.55 Athletic Greens is terrific
268.92 because it covers your nutritional bases.
271.64 If I drink Athletic Greens once
273.12 and I sometimes drink it twice a day,
275.33 then I'm sure that all
the vitamins I need,
277.95 I'm getting those.
278.783 All the minerals I
need, I'm getting those,
280.15 and the probiotics.
281.67 There's now a ton of data
283.34 showing that a healthy gut microbiome
285.81 is vital to brain function,
287.56 vital to immune function,
288.88 and vital to all aspects of our health.
291.29 So with Athletic Greens,
you get the vitamins,
293.21 the minerals, and the probiotics
to cover all your bases.
296.14 In fact, anytime people ask
me what should they take
299.18 or what could they do
to support their health,
301.19 provided that they
already have their sleep
302.88 and other aspects of their life in order,
304.8 Athletic Greens is the
thing that I recommend
306.8 because it covers all the
foundations, all the bases
310.25 of what one really wants from a supplement
312.41 without having to take a
ton of different things.
314.52 It also tastes great,
315.8 almost everybody that tries it
317.22 and then reported back to me has told me
319.04 that they really liked the taste.
320.39 I mix mine with water,
321.61 a little bit of lemon and lime juice,
322.91 and I really like the
taste, it's delicious to me.
325.31 I drink it once or twice a day.
327.33 It's keto compatible,
328.67 it's compatible with
most fasting regimens,
330.95 it's compatible with if you're a vegan
334.52 or if you're not vegan, it's compatible
335.98 with essentially every
nutritional plan out there,
337.93 so it's just a terrific
all around supplement
340.43 and benefit to one's health and diet.
343.28 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
344.71 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
347.69 And if you do that, you'll
claim a special offer,
349.67 they'll give you five free travel packs
351.31 that make it easy to
mix up Athletic Greens
353.1 while you're on the road,
354.17 and they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3, K2.
358.16 Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
361.22 to claim that special offer.
362.92 This month, we've been
talking about the senses,
365.23 how we detect things in our environment.
368.32 The last episode was all about vision,
370.7 how we take light and
convert that information
373.81 into things that we can perceive
375.6 like colors, and faces, and motion,
378.11 things of that sort
378.943 as well as how we use
light to change our biology
381.8 in ways that are subconscious
that we don't realize,
384.24 things like mood, and metabolism,
and levels of alertness.
388.72 Today, we're going to talk
about chemical sensing,
391.58 we're going to talk
about the sense of smell,
394.36 our ability to detect
odors in our environment.
397.72 We're also going to talk about taste,
399.68 our ability to detect chemicals
402.31 and make sense of chemicals
that are put in our mouth
405.9 and into our digestive tract.
407.81 And we are going to talk about chemicals
409.77 that are made by other human beings
412.27 that powerfully modulator
the way that we feel,
415.03 our hormones, and our health.
417.51 Now, that last category are
sometimes called pheromones.
421.09 However, whether or not
pheromones exist in humans
424.17 is rather controversial,
425.6 there actually hasn't been a clear example
428.24 of a true human pheromonal effect,
431.0 but what is absolutely
clear, what is undeniable
434.2 is that there are chemicals
that human beings make
438.1 and release in things
like tears onto our skin,
442.58 and sweat, and even breath
that powerfully modulate
447.12 or control the biology
of other individuals.
450.16 In fact right now, even if
you're completely alone,
453.72 your chemical environment
internally is being controlled
457.27 by external chemicals,
459.16 your nervous system, and your
hormones, and your metabolism
462.37 are being modified by
things in your environment,
466.2 so we're going to talk about those.
468.08 It's an absolutely fascinating
aspect to our biology,
471.35 it's one of our most primordial,
474.09 meaning primitive aspects of our biology,
476.45 but it's still very
active in all of us today.
480.56 This episode, believe it or not,
481.74 will have a lot of tools,
a lot of protocols.
485.66 Even though I'm guessing most of you
487.32 can probably smell your
environment just fine,
490.22 that you know what you like
to eat and what tastes good,
492.42 and what doesn't taste good to you,
494.87 today's episode is going
to talk about tools
496.77 that will allow you to actually leverage
499.55 these chemical sensing mechanisms,
501.3 including how you smell
503.61 not how you smell in
the qualitative sense,
506.007 but how you smell in the verb sense,
508.21 the action of sniffing and smelling
510.93 to enhance your sense of smell
513.31 and to enhance your
sense of taste as well,
516.55 believe it or not, to
enhance your cognition,
519.01 your ability to learn and remember things.
521.56 Everything we're going
to talk about as always
523.27 is grounded in quality
peer-reviewed studies
525.63 from some excellent laboratories,
527.51 I'll provide some resources along the way,
529.44 so that means tools and protocols
531.1 and also basic information.
531.933 You're going to learn
a ton of neuroscience
534.68 and lot of biology in general.
536.81 And I think what you'll
come to realize by the end
539.16 is that while we are clearly different
541.3 from the other animals,
542.77 there are aspects to our
biology that are very similar
546.74 to that of other animals
in very interesting ways.
550.43 Before we dive into chemical sensing,
552.66 I want to just briefly
touch on a few things
554.62 from the vision episode.
556.39 One is a summary of a protocol.
559.02 So, I covered 13 protocols last episode,
561.93 if you haven't seen that
episode, check it out.
564.05 Those protocols will
allow you to be more alert
566.57 and to see better over
time if you follow them.
569.01 All of them are zero cost,
570.12 you can find any and all
of them at hubermanlab.com,
573.35 there's a link to those videos
and tools and protocols,
576.61 everything is timestamped.
579.33 The two protocols that I just
want to remind everybody of
583.69 are the protocol of near-far
viewing that all of us
588.67 regardless of age, should
probably spend about five minutes
593.11 three times a week, doing some
near-far viewing exercises.
596.77 So, that would be bringing a pen or pencil
598.78 up close to the point where
you're about to cross your eyes,
601.42 but you don't cross your eyes
603.13 and then out at some distance.
604.84 And then look beyond that pen
606.58 or other object that you're using
609.28 off as far as you can into the distance.
611.12 It would be great if you could
do this on a balcony or deck
613.28 and then look way off in the distance
614.9 and then bring it back in.
616.15 This is going to exercise
that accommodation reflex,
619.08 the change in the shape of the lens
621.01 can help offset a number of things
623.33 including myopia, near-sightedness.
625.76 The other one is this incredible study
628.62 that showed that two hours a day outside,
631.67 even if you're doing other
things while you're outside
634.18 can help offset myopia, nearsightedness.
637.3 So, try and get outside,
638.7 it's really the sunlight
and the blue light, right?
640.92 Everyone's been demonizing
blue light out there,
642.66 but blue light is great
643.96 provided it's not super, super bright
646.73 and really close to your eyes.
648.18 Blue is terrific if it
comes from sunlight.
651.07 Two hours a day outside
652.39 is going to help offset
myopia, nearsightedness.
655.39 Now, that's a lot of time,
656.39 I think most of us are
not getting that time,
658.56 but since you can do other
things like gardening,
660.84 or reading, or walking, or running.
663.17 If you can get that two hours outside
664.77 your visual system and
your brain will benefit.
668.08 I also would like to
make one brief correction
671.19 to something that I said incorrectly
673.38 in the previous episode.
675.1 At the end of the episode,
I talked about lutein,
678.52 and how lutein may help offset
681.6 some moderate to severe
age-related macular degeneration.
685.49 As well, I talked about how some people
686.91 are supplementing with lutein
688.55 even though they don't have
age-related macular degeneration
691.75 with the idea in mind
692.8 that it might help offset some vision loss
695.21 as they get older.
696.78 I said lutein, and lutein
was the correct thing to say,
700.31 but once or twice, when
I started speaking fast
703.97 I said leucine and not lutein.
707.48 I want to emphasize that leucine,
709.79 an amino acid, very interesting,
711.56 important for muscle building
covered in previous episodes,
714.55 but lutein, L-U-T-E-I-N,
719.25 is the molecule and compound
that I was referring to
721.91 in terms of supplementing
for sake of vision.
724.54 So I apologize, please
forgive me I misspoke,
727.56 a couple of you caught that right away,
729.96 in listening to the
episode after it went up
731.86 I realized that I had misspoken.
733.67 So, lutein for vision,
735.53 leucine for muscles, and muscle growth,
738.55 and strength, et cetera.
740.16 Before we dive into the
content of today's episode,
743.08 I want to just briefly
touch on color vision.
745.84 Many of you asked questions
about color vision
748.42 and color perception.
749.85 And indeed color perception
is a fascinating aspect
753.28 of the human visual system,
755.12 it's one of the things
that makes us unique.
757.18 There are certainly
other animals out there
759.4 that can detect all the
colors of the rainbow,
761.56 some can even detect into the
infrared, into the far-red
765.86 that we can't see,
767.44 but nonetheless, human color vision,
769.19 provided that somebody isn't colorblind,
771.19 is really remarkable.
773.1 And if you're interested in color vision
775.2 or you want to answer questions
776.9 about art or about for instance
779.63 why that dress that showed
up online a few years ago
782.59 looks blue to you and
yellow to somebody else.
785.2 All the answers to that
are in this terrific book
788.01 which is "What Is Color?:
789.69 50 Questions and Answers
on the Science of Color".
792.48 I did not write this book, I wish I had,
794.87 the book is by Arielle and Joann Eckstut,
797.63 that E-C-K-S-T-U-T.
800.42 So, it's "What Is Color?:
801.8 50 Questions and Answers
on the Science of Color".
805.65 It's an absolutely fabulous book,
807.13 I've no business relationship to them.
809.24 I did help them get in contact
811.33 with some color vision scientists
812.9 when they reached out to me.
814.33 And you can know that all
the information in the book
816.3 was vetted by excellent
color vision scientists.
819.21 It's a really wonderful
and beautiful book,
821.12 the illustrations are beautiful.
822.63 If you're somebody who's
interested in design or art,
826.32 or you're just curious
about the science of color,
828.4 it's a terrific book,
I highly recommend it.
830.43 If you just look it up online,
831.88 there are a variety of places
833.27 that will allow you to access the book.
835.24 So, let's talk about sensing chemicals
837.43 and how chemicals control us.
840.44 In our environment,
841.44 there are a lot of
different physical stimuli.
844.75 There is light,
846.23 photons, which are light energy
849.05 and those land on your retinas
851.55 and your retinas tell
your brain about them,
854.06 and your brain creates
this thing we call vision.
856.94 There are sound waves,
858.03 literally particles moving through the air
860.68 and reverberations that create
863.13 what we call sound and hearing.
865.57 And of course there
are mechanical stimuli,
869.31 pressure, light touch, scratch,
873.37 tickle, et cetera, that lands on our skin
875.77 or the blowing of a breeze
877.07 that deflects the hairs on our skin,
879.44 and we can sense mechanical
touch, mechanical sensation.
884.63 And there are chemicals,
886.21 there are things floating
around in the environment
889.88 which we call volatile chemicals.
892.65 So, volatile sounds oftentimes
like emotionally volatile,
895.9 but it just means that they're
floating around out there.
898.41 So, when you actually smell something
901.03 like let's say you smell
902.76 a wonderfully smelling rose or cake.
905.77 Yes, you are inhaling the
particles into your nose,
910.0 they're literally little particles
911.57 of those chemicals are
going up into your nose
914.25 and being detected by your brain.
918.16 Also, if you smell something putrid,
920.35 disgusting, or awful,
use your imagination,
923.89 those particles are
going up into your nose
926.78 and being detected by neurons
that are part of your brain.
931.7 Other ways of getting
chemicals into our system
934.46 is by putting them in our mouth,
937.46 by literally taking
foods and chewing them,
941.55 or sucking on them and breaking them down
943.81 into their component parts,
945.44 and that's one way that we sense chemicals
947.35 with this thing, our tongue.
950.05 And there are chemicals that can enter
953.14 through other mucosal linings
955.65 and other kind of just think damp,
958.07 sticky linings of your body.
960.39 And the main ones would be the eyes,
962.81 so you've got your nose,
your eyes and your mouth.
964.9 But mainly when we have
chemicals coming into our system
967.64 it's through our nose
or through our mouth.
970.32 Although, sometimes through our skin
972.88 certain things can go
transdermal, not many,
975.27 and through our eyes.
977.09 So these chemicals,
979.44 we sometimes bring into
our body, into our biology,
983.37 through deliberate action.
984.93 We select a food, we chew that food,
987.81 and we do it intentionally.
988.96 Sometimes they're coming into our body
991.14 through non-deliberate action.
992.86 We enter an environment,
994.49 and there's smoke and we smell the smoke,
996.56 and as a consequence we take action.
999.3 Sometimes we are forced to eat something
1001.5 because somebody tells us we should eat it
1003.31 or we do it to be polite.
1004.82 So, there are all these ways
1005.653 that chemicals can make it into our body.
1008.52 Sometimes however, other people
1010.84 are actively making
chemicals with their body,
1013.77 typically this would be with their breath,
1016.55 with their tears,
1018.33 or possibly, I want to
underscore possibly,
1021.83 by making what are called pheromones,
1023.53 molecules that they release
into the environment
1025.59 typically through the breath
1027.73 that enter our system through our nose,
1030.37 or our eyes, or our mouth
1032.07 that fundamentally change our biology.
1036.02 I will explain how smell and taste
1038.4 and these pheromone effects work,
1040.84 but I'll just give an example,
1042.31 which is a very salient
and interesting one
1045.46 that was published about 10 years ago
1047.47 in the Journal Science.
1049.0 Science Magazine is one of the three
1050.83 what we call apex journals.
1053.09 There are a lot of journals out there,
1054.41 but for those of you that want to know,
1055.81 Science Magazine, Nature
Magazine, and Cell
1060.39 are considered the three
top kind of apex journals,
1063.59 they are the most stringent
1065.0 in terms of getting papers accepted,
1067.76 they're even reviewed there.
1068.73 They have about a 95% rejection
rate at the front gate,
1073.41 meaning they don't even review 95%
1075.37 of what gets sent to them.
1076.68 Of the things that they
do decide to review
1079.17 then get sent out,
1080.3 a very small percentage
of those get published,
1082.51 it's very stringent.
1083.8 This paper came out in Science
1086.49 showing that humans, men in
particular in this study,
1090.35 have a strong biological
response and hormonal response
1094.46 to the tears of women.
1098.31 What they did is they had women,
1100.79 and in this case it was only
women for whatever reason,
1104.5 cry and they collected their tears.
1108.47 Then those tears were
smelled by male subjects,
1112.12 or male subjects got what
was essentially the control,
1116.59 which was the saline.
1118.27 Men that smelled these tears
that were evoked by sadness
1124.25 had a reduction in their
testosterone levels
1126.53 that was significant.
1128.21 They also had a reduction in brain areas
1130.77 that were associated with sexual arousal.
1133.59 Now, before you run off
with your interpretations
1136.36 about what this means
and criticize the study
1138.44 for any variety of reasons,
let's just take a step back.
1142.21 I will criticize the study
for a variety of reasons too.
1145.21 One is that they only used
female tiers and male subjects,
1149.55 so it would have been nice for
them to also use female tears
1153.45 and female subjects smelling those,
1156.1 male tears and male
subjects smelling those,
1158.8 male tears and female subjects
smelling those, and so on.
1162.29 They didn't do that,
1163.45 they did have a large number of subjects,
1164.94 so that's good, that
adds power to the study.
1168.11 And they did have to collect these tears
1171.28 by having the women watch
what was essentially
1173.73 a sad scene from a movie.
1175.42 They actually recruited subjects
that had a high propensity
1177.96 for crying at sad movies,
which was not all women.
1181.6 It turns out that the
people that they recruited
1183.12 for the study were people who said, "Yes,
1185.27 I tend to cry when I see
sad things in movies."
1188.43 What they're really trying to do
1189.263 is get just get tears that
were authentically cried
1193.43 in response to sadness,
1195.25 as opposed to putting
some irritant in the eye
1198.42 and collecting tears that
were evoked by something else
1202.21 like just having the eyes irritated.
1204.78 Nonetheless, what this study illustrates
1208.36 is that there are chemicals in tears
1211.75 that are evoking or changing the biology
1214.5 of other individuals.
1216.56 Now, most of us don't think about sniffing
1218.74 or smelling other people's tears,
1220.94 but you can imagine how in close couples,
1224.11 or in family members,
1225.2 or even close friendships, et cetera,
1227.73 that we are often in close proximity
1229.78 to other people's tears.
1231.59 Now, I didn't select
this study as an example
1234.14 because I want to focus on the effects
1236.11 of tears on hormones, per se,
1238.24 although I do find the
results really interesting.
1240.86 I chose it because I
wanted to just emphasize
1244.36 or underscore the fact
1245.71 that chemicals that are
made by other individuals
1248.67 are powerfully modulating
our internal state,
1252.76 and that's something that
most of us don't appreciate.
1256.33 I think most of us can appreciate the fact
1258.54 that if we smell something
putrid, we tend to retract,
1261.1 or if we smell something
delicious, we tend to lean into it.
1264.77 But there are all these
ways in which chemicals
1266.79 are affecting our biology,
1268.35 and interpersonal
communication using chemicals
1272.65 is not something that we
hear that often about,
1275.56 but it's super interesting.
1276.91 So, let's talk about smell
1278.25 and what smell is and how it works.
1280.34 I'm going to make this very basic,
1281.94 but I am going to touch on
some of the core elements
1284.09 of the neurobiology.
1285.55 So, here's how smell works.
1287.69 Smell starts with sniffing.
1290.61 Now, that may come as no surprise,
1292.24 but no volatile chemicals
can enter our nose
1296.21 unless we inhale them.
1297.66 If our nose is occluded, or
if we're actively exhaling
1301.93 it's much more difficult for
smells to enter our nose,
1305.27 which is why people cover their nose
1306.7 when something smells bad.
1309.42 Now, the way that these volatile odors
1312.44 come into the nose is interesting.
1314.18 The nose has a mucosal lining,
1316.44 mucus that is designed to trap things,
1319.19 to actually bring things
in and get stuck there.
1323.13 At the base of your brain,
1324.54 so you could actually imagine this
1326.63 or if you wanted, you could
touch the roof of your mouth.
1328.927 So, right above the roof of the mouth,
1331.18 about two centimeters
is your olfactory bulb.
1334.54 The olfactory bulb is
a collection of neurons
1336.66 and those neurons actually
extend out of the skull,
1340.41 out of your skull into your nose
1343.1 into the mucosal lining.
1344.76 So, what this means in
kind of a literal sense
1347.37 is that you have neurons that extend
1350.09 their little dendrites
and axon-like things,
1353.36 they're little processes as we call them,
1355.33 out into the mucus,
1357.33 and they respond to
different odorant compounds.
1361.17 Now, the olfactory neurons
1363.09 also send a branch deeper into the brain
1366.22 and they split off into
three different paths.
1370.93 So, one path is for what we
call innate odor responses,
1376.29 so you have some hard wired aspects
1379.26 to the way that you smell the world
1381.13 that were there from the day you were born
1383.16 and that will be there
until the day you die.
1385.91 These are the pathways and
the neurons that respond
1389.73 to things like smoke,
1392.21 which as you can imagine there's
a highly adaptive function
1395.47 to being able to detect burning things
1397.73 because burning things
generally means lack of safety
1400.86 or impending threat of some kind.
1404.12 It calls for action,
1405.67 and indeed these neurons project
1407.57 to the central area of the
brain called the amygdala,
1410.21 which is often discussed in terms of fear,
1412.1 but it's really fear and threat detection.
1414.98 So some compounds, some
chemicals in your environment
1417.66 when you smell them, unless
you're trained to overcome them
1420.93 because you're a firefighter
1422.75 you will naturally have a
heightened level of alertness,
1426.96 you will sense threat,
1429.03 and if you're in sleep,
even it will wake you up.
1432.09 All right, so that's a good thing,
1432.99 it's kind of an emergency system.
1435.18 You also have neurons in your nose
1437.72 that respond to odorants
1439.16 or combinations of odorants
that evoke a sense of desire
1444.13 and what we call appetitive
behaviors, approach behaviors,
1447.53 that make you want to
move toward something.
1449.7 So, when you smell a delicious cookie,
1452.69 or some dish that's really
savory that you really like,
1457.39 or a wonderful orange,
1460.22 and you say, "Mmm,"
1461.8 or it feels delicious,
or it smells delicious
1465.33 that's because of these innate pathway,
1467.22 these pathways that require
no learning whatsoever.
1470.66 Now, some of the pathways from the nose,
1473.25 these olfactory neurons into the brain
1475.21 are involved in learned
associations with odors.
1479.28 Many people have this experience
1482.97 that they can remember the smell
1486.73 of their grandmother's home,
1488.56 or their grandmother's hands even,
1491.14 or the smell of particular items baking,
1494.56 or on the stove in a
particular environment.
1498.87 Typically, these memories tend
to be of a kind of nurturing
1501.85 sort of feeling safe and protected.
1504.49 But one of the reasons why olfaction smell
1508.37 is so closely tied to memory
1510.31 is because olfaction is the
most ancient sense that we have,
1513.88 or I should say chemical sensing
is among the most primitive
1517.27 and ancient senses that we have,
1519.4 probably almost certainly evolved
1521.11 before vision and before hearing.
1524.14 But when we come into the world
1527.01 because we're still learning
about the statistics of life
1530.03 about who's friendly
and who's not friendly,
1532.41 and where's a fun place to be
1533.83 and where's a boring place to be,
1535.89 that all takes a long time to learn.
1537.6 But the olfactory system seems to imprint,
1540.72 seems to lay down memories very early
1543.9 and create these very
powerful associations.
1547.38 And if you think about it
long enough and hard enough
1551.12 many of you can probably realize
1554.17 that there are certain
smells that evoke a memory
1557.54 of a particular place,
or person, or context.
1560.8 And that's because you also
have pathways out of the nose
1563.87 that are not for innate
behaviors like cringing,
1566.93 or repulsion, or gagging,
1570.85 or for that appetitive mmm sensation,
1573.41 but that just remind you of a place,
1575.62 or a thing, or a context,
1577.43 could be flowers in spring,
1579.27 could be grandmother's home and cookies.
1582.14 This is a very common occurrence,
1584.62 and it's a very common occurrence
1585.96 because this generally
exists in all of us.
1588.34 So, we have pathway for innate responses
1591.73 and a pathway for learned responses.
1593.62 And then we have this other pathway,
1596.09 and in humans it's a
little bit controversial
1598.12 as to whether or not
it sits truly separate
1600.41 from the standard olfactory system
1602.89 or whether or not it's its
own system embedded in there,
1606.46 but that they call the
accessory olfactory pathway.
1610.47 Accessory olfactory pathway
is what in other animals
1613.72 is responsible for true pheromone effects.
1617.01 We will talk about true pheromone effects,
1619.14 but for example in rodents
1622.47 and in some primates, including mandrills.
1625.99 If you've ever seen a mandrill,
1626.89 they have these like
big beak noses things,
1629.04 you may have seen them at the zoo,
1629.97 look them up if you
haven't seen them already,
1631.54 M-A-N-D-R-I-L-S
1633.93 mandrills, there are
strong pheromone effects.
1637.32 Some of those include things like
1640.16 if you take a pregnant
female rodent or mandrill,
1644.91 you take away the father
that created those
1649.48 fetuses or fetus,
1651.96 and you introduce the scent of the urine
1656.1 or the fur of a novel male,
1659.88 she will spontaneously abort
or miscarry those fetuses,
1663.457 it's a very powerful effect.
1666.63 In humans, it's still controversial
1668.4 whether or not anything
like that can happen,
1670.47 but it's a very powerful
pheromonal effect in other animals.
1673.6 Another example of a pheromone effect
1676.05 is called the Vandenbergh effect
1677.56 named after the person who
discovered this effect,
1680.15 where you take a female
1682.97 of a given species that
has not entered puberty,
1686.2 you expose her to the scent or the urine
1690.04 from a sexually competent,
meaning post-pubertal male,
1694.85 and she spontaneously
goes into puberty earlier.
1698.78 So, something about the scent
1699.96 triggers something through this
accessory olfactory system,
1703.2 this is a true pheromonal effect
1705.12 and creates ovulation,
right and menstruation.
1708.88 Or in rodents it's an estrous
cycle, not a menstrual cycle.
1712.38 So, this is not to say
that the exact same things
1716.43 happen in humans.
1717.263 In humans, as I mentioned earlier,
1719.1 there are chemical sensing
between individuals
1721.52 that may be independent of the nose.
1724.55 And we will talk about those,
1726.24 but those are basically the three paths
1728.32 by which smells, odors impact us.
1731.84 So, I want to talk about
the act of smelling,
1734.99 and if you are not somebody who
is very interested in smell,
1738.83 but you are somebody who is interested
1740.37 in making your brain work better,
1742.23 learning faster, remembering more things,
1744.83 this next little segment is for you
1747.02 because it turns out that how you smell,
1749.78 meaning the act of smelling,
not how good or bad you smell,
1752.81 but the act of smelling,
1755.92 sniffing, and inhalation
powerfully impacts
1758.79 how your brain functions
1760.24 and what you can learn
and what you can't learn.
1762.97 Breathing generally
consists of two actions,
1765.74 inhaling and exhaling,
1767.69 and we have the option of course
1769.02 to do that through our nose or our mouth.
1772.26 I've talked on previous
episodes about the fact
1774.28 that there are great advantages
to being a nasal breather,
1778.31 and there are a great disadvantages
1780.04 to being a mouth breather.
1782.25 There are excellent
books and data on this,
1785.23 there's the recent book
"Breath" by James Nestor,
1787.76 which is an excellent book
1789.41 that describes some of
the positive effects
1791.64 of nasal breathing as well
as other breathing practices.
1794.52 There's also the book
"Jaws" by my colleagues,
1797.19 Paul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn,
1798.62 with a foreword by Jared Diamond
1801.05 and an introduction by Robert
Sapolsky from Stanford.
1805.03 So, that's a book chockablock
1806.81 with heavy hitter authors that describes
1809.58 how being a nasal breather is
beneficial for jaw structure,
1814.21 for immune system function, et cetera
1817.71 Breathing in through your nose,
1820.31 sniffing actually has positive effects
1823.43 on the way that you can acquire
and remember information.
1828.1 Noam Sobel's group
originally at UC Berkeley
1831.37 and then at the Weizmann Institute
1833.78 has published a number of papers
1836.69 that I'd like to discuss today.
1838.39 One of them, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition
1842.31 Phase-Locked with Inhalation,
1843.73 this was published in
Nature Human Behavior,
1845.68 an excellent journal.
1848.01 Showed that the act of inhaling
1851.017 [Andrew inhales deeply]
1852.05 has a couple of interesting
and powerful consequences.
1855.4 First of all, as we inhale
1858.11 the brain increases in arousal,
1861.41 our level of alertness
and attention increases
1863.96 when we inhale as compared
to when we exhale.
1867.14 Now, of course with every
inhale, there's an exhale,
1870.05 you could probably
double up on your inhales
1871.93 if you're doing size or something,
1873.34 physiological size I've
talked about these before,
1875.23 so double inhales [inhales twice]
1876.4 followed by an exhale [exhales],
1877.96 something like that.
1878.86 Or if you're speaking, you're
going to change your cadence
1881.29 and ratio of inhales and exhales,
1882.67 but typically we inhale, then we exhale.
1886.36 As we inhale, what this paper shows
1889.53 is that the level of alertness
goes up in the brain,
1894.04 and this makes sense because
as the most primitive
1897.3 and primordial sense by which we interact
1900.5 with our environment and bring
chemicals into our system
1904.43 and detect our environment,
1906.53 inhaling is a cue for
the rest of the brain
1910.8 to essentially to pay
attention to what's happening,
1914.31 not just to the odors
1915.54 as the name of this paper suggests,
1917.92 Human Non-Olfactory Cognition
Phase-Locked with Inhalation.
1922.91 What that means is that
the act of inhaling itself
1927.1 wakes up the brain,
1928.22 it's not about what you're perceiving
1930.3 or what you're smelling.
1932.37 And indeed sniffing as an action,
1935.01 inhaling as an action
has a powerful effect
1938.06 on your ability to be alert,
1940.71 your ability to attend, to focus,
1943.2 and your ability to remember information.
1946.05 When we exhale, the brain
goes through a subtle,
1950.25 but nonetheless significant dip
1952.46 in level of arousal and ability to learn.
1955.87 So, what does this mean?
1957.3 How should you use this knowledge?
1959.45 Well, you could imagine,
1961.86 and I think this will be
beneficial for most people
1964.75 to focus on nasal breathing
1966.82 while doing any kind of focused
work that doesn't require
1970.18 that you speak, or eat,
or ingest something.
1973.53 There's a separate paper published
1974.94 in the journal of neuroscience that showed
1977.24 that indeed if subjects, human subjects,
1979.41 are restricted to breathing
through their nose,
1982.53 they learn better than
if they have the option
1985.92 of breathing through their mouth,
1987.62 or a combination of their nose and mouth.
1989.63 These are significant effects
1990.88 in humans using modern
techniques from excellent groups.
1994.43 So, sniffing itself is
a powerful modulator
1998.21 of our cognition and our ability to learn.
2002.14 You can imagine all sorts of ways
2003.32 that you might apply that as a tool.
2005.23 And I suggest that you play with it a bit
2007.4 that if you're having a hard
time staying awake and alert,
2010.47 you're having a hard time
remembering information,
2012.46 you feel like you have a
kind of attention deficit,
2014.55 nonclinical of course,
2016.33 nasal breathing ought to help,
2018.03 extending or making your inhales
more intense ought to help.
2023.11 Now, this isn't really about
chemical sensing per se,
2025.94 but here's where it gets
interesting and exciting.
2029.02 If you are somebody
2029.91 who doesn't have a very
good sense of smell,
2033.05 or you're somebody who
simply wants to get better
2035.37 at smelling and tasting things,
2038.24 you can actually practice sniffing.
2040.88 I know that sounds ridiculous,
2042.13 but it turns out that
simply sniffing nothing.
2045.56 So, doing something like this.
2046.835 [Andrew sniffs deeply]
2048.59 I guess the microphone sort
of has a smell [sniffs],
2050.51 I guess my pen doesn't have a smell.
2052.42 [Andrew sniffs deeply]
2054.06 It turns out that doing
a series of inhales,
2056.7 and of course each one
is followed by an exhale,
2058.83 10 or 15 times and then smelling an object
2062.73 like an orange or another item of food,
2066.089 or even the skin of somebody else
2067.99 will lead to an increase in your ability
2071.28 to perceive those odors.
2073.94 Now, there are probably
two reasons for that.
2076.45 One reason is that the brain systems
2078.64 of detecting things are waking up
2080.19 as a mere consequence of inhaling.
2082.24 Okay, so this is sort of
the olfactory equivalent
2085.47 of opening your eyes wider in
order to see, more or less.
2089.79 Okay, last episode I talked about
2091.07 how opening your eyes wider
2092.13 actually increases your
level of alertness,
2094.1 it's not just that your level of alertness
2095.71 causes your eyes to be open wider.
2098.04 Opening your eyes wider
2098.9 can actually increase
your level of alertness.
2100.8 Well, it turns out that
breathing more deeply
2102.37 through the nose, wakes up your brain
2104.7 and it creates a heightened sensitivity
2108.47 of the neurons that relate to smell.
2111.87 And there's a close crossover,
2114.01 I'm sure you know this,
between smell and taste.
2116.27 If any of you have ever had a cold
2118.16 or you have for whatever reason
2119.7 you've lost your sense of smell,
2121.07 you become what they call anosmic,
2122.61 your sense of taste suffers also.
2124.55 We'll talk a little bit more
2125.5 about why that is in a few minutes,
2127.56 but as a first protocol,
2128.96 I'd really like all of you to consider
2131.66 becoming nasal breathers
2133.07 while you're trying to learn,
while you're trying to listen,
2136.11 while you're trying to wake
up your brain in any way
2139.73 and learn and retain information,
2142.63 this is a powerful tool.
2144.9 Now, there are other ways
2145.79 to wake up your brain more as well.
2147.99 For instance, the use of smelling salts.
2150.48 I'm not recommending that
you do this necessarily,
2152.46 but there are excellent peer reviewed data
2155.25 showing that indeed, if
you use smelling salts,
2158.9 which are mostly of the
sort that include ammonia,
2162.77 ammonia is a very toxic scent,
2165.87 but it's toxic in a way that
triggers this innate pathway,
2170.18 the pathway from the nose to the amygdala,
2172.17 and wakes up the brain
and body in a major way.
2174.77 This is why they use smelling salts
2176.01 when people pass out,
2177.08 this is why fighters used to use
2179.71 or maybe sometimes
still use smelling salts
2182.64 in order to heighten
their level of alertness,
2184.25 this is why powerlifters
will inhale smelling salts.
2188.18 They work because they trigger the fear
2191.63 and kind of overall arousal
systems of the brain,
2194.32 this is why I think most
people probably shouldn't
2195.97 use ammonia or smelling
salts to try and wake up,
2198.28 but they really do work.
2200.15 If you've ever smelled smelling salts
2201.63 and I have, I tried this,
2203.45 they give you a serious jolt,
2205.71 it's like six espresso
2207.55 infused into your bloodstream all at once,
2209.42 you are wide awake immediately
2211.61 and you feel a heightened
sense of kind of desire to move
2214.86 because you release
adrenaline into your body.
2217.29 Now, inhaling through your nose
2218.78 and doing nasal breathing
is not going to do that,
2220.8 it's going to be a more subtle
version of waking up your system
2224.95 of alerting your brain overall.
2227.68 And for those of you that are
interested in having a richer,
2231.76 a more deep connection
2234.26 to the things that you smell and taste,
2236.3 including other individuals
perhaps not just food,
2241.1 practicing or enhancing
your sense of sniffing,
2243.43 your ability to sniff
2244.51 might sound like a kind
of ridiculous protocol,
2246.53 but it's actually a kind
of fun and cool experiment
2249.21 that you can do.
2250.043 You just do the simple
experiment of taking for instance
2252.58 an orange, you smell it,
2254.15 try and gauge your level of perception
2256.95 of how orange-ish it smells,
2259.01 or lemony, lemonish, lemony, I don't know
2261.83 is it lemonish or lemony?
2263.83 Lemony it smells, then set it away,
2268.21 do 10 or 15 inhales
2270.211 [Andrew inhales and exhales]
2271.44 followed by exhales of course,
2272.61 or just through the nose.
2273.629 [Andrew breaths rapidly]
2274.636 I'm not going to do all 10 or 15.
2276.01 And then smell it again,
2277.25 and you'll notice that your
perception of that smell,
2279.367 the kind of richness of that smell
2281.81 will be significantly increased.
2283.81 And that's again, for two reasons,
2285.42 one, the brain is in a position
to respond to it better,
2289.28 your brain has been aroused
by the mere act of sniffing,
2292.43 but also the neurons that respond
2294.66 to that lemon odor, that lemony or odor
2298.31 are going to respond better.
2299.88 So, you can actually have
a heightened experience
2302.59 of something, and that of
course will also be true
2304.89 for the taste system.
2306.04 You also can really
train your sense of smell
2308.69 to get much, much better.
2310.52 When Noam Sobel's group was at Berkeley
2312.17 I happened to be a graduate
student around that time,
2314.75 and every once in a while I'd look outside
2317.35 and there would be people
crawling around on the grass
2320.74 with goggles on, gloves on,
2322.59 and these hoods on with earmuffs.
2325.47 And they looked ridiculous,
2327.47 but what they were doing
is they were actually
2329.14 learning to follow scent trails.
2331.92 So, in the world of dogs
2333.45 you have sight hounds that use their eyes
2335.52 in order to navigate and find things,
2337.73 and you have scent towns
that use their nose.
2339.48 And the scent hounds are remarkable,
2340.89 they can be trained to detect a scent.
2342.92 These are the sniffing,
2344.39 you know, the bomb sniffing
2345.223 and the drug sniffing dogs in airports.
2348.27 There are now dogs actually that can sniff
2350.63 out COVID infections with a
very high degree of accuracy,
2354.19 they can be trained to do that.
2355.43 There's something about the COVID
2357.94 and similar infections
that the body produces
2360.58 probably in the immune response,
2362.1 some odors and the dogs
are I think as high as 90%
2365.39 in some cases, maybe even 95% accuracy,
2367.96 just remarkable.
2369.14 There are theories that
dogs can sniff out cancer,
2371.87 this stuff all exceeds
statistical significance.
2374.72 It's still a little bit
mysterious in some ways,
2376.81 but you may not ever achieve
2379.95 the olfactory capabilities
of a scent hound,
2383.26 but what Noam Sobel's lab
did is they had people
2388.12 completely eliminate
their visual experience
2390.33 by having them wear
dark glasses or goggles,
2393.21 so they couldn't see,
and they couldn't hear,
2394.61 they couldn't sense anything
with their sense of touch,
2396.66 they had thick gloves on.
2398.05 But they had these masks on
2399.83 where just their nasal passages were open
2402.17 and people could in a
fairly short amount of time
2405.95 learn to follow a chocolate
scent trail on the ground,
2409.89 which is not something that
most people want to do,
2412.55 but what they showed using
brain imaging, et cetera
2415.22 in subsequent studies
is that the human brain,
2419.36 you can learn to really
enhance your sense of smell
2423.09 and become very astute in distinguishing
2425.93 whether or not one particular odor
2427.86 or combinations of odors
2429.18 is such that it's less than,
2432.52 or more than a different
odor for instance.
2435.19 Now, why would you want to do this?
2436.27 Well, if you like to eat as much as I do,
2439.43 one of the things
2440.263 that can really enhance
your sense of pleasure
2443.53 from the experience of ingesting food
2445.66 is to enhance your sense of smell.
2447.57 And if you don't have
a great sense of smell,
2450.27 or if you have a sense of smell
2451.67 that's really so good that it's
always picking up bad odors,
2455.19 we'll talk about that in a minute.
2457.27 Well, then you might want to
tune up your sense of smell
2461.73 by doing this practice
of 10 or 15 breaths,
2465.0 excuse me, sniffs, not breaths,
2466.66 sniffs and then interacting
with some food item
2470.45 or thing that you're
interested in smelling more of.
2472.48 So, these could be the ingredients
that you're cooking with,
2474.29 I really encourage you to
try and really smell them.
2476.67 You sometimes hear this
2477.61 as kind of a mindfulness practice
2478.93 like ooh, really smell the
food, really taste the food.
2481.967 And we always hear about that
2483.19 as kind of a mindfulness
and presence thing,
2485.84 but you actually can
increase the sensitivity
2488.1 of your olfactory and your
taste system by doing this.
2490.91 And it has long-term effects,
2493.16 that's what's so interesting.
2494.32 This isn't the kind of thing
2495.153 that you have to do every time you eat.
2496.66 You don't have to be the
weirdo in the restaurant
2498.18 that's like picking up the radish
2499.84 and like jamming it up your
nostrils, please don't do that.
2502.71 You don't have to
necessarily smell everything,
2504.78 although it's nice
sometimes to smell the food
2507.81 that you're about to
eat and as you eat it,
2509.66 but it has long-term effects
2511.07 in terms of your ability to distinguish
2513.67 and discriminate different types of odors.
2516.63 And these don't even have
to be very pungent foods
2518.89 it turns out,
2519.723 the studies show that doesn't have
2521.05 to be some really stinky cheese,
2522.65 you know, there are cheese shops
2524.05 that I've walked into where
like I just basically gag,
2526.23 I can't handle it, I
just can't be in there,
2528.315 it just overwhelms me.
2529.91 Other people, they love that smell.
2531.9 So, you have to tune it to
your interest and experience,
2534.38 but I think even for
you fasters out there,
2537.21 everybody eats at some point,
2539.4 everybody ingests chemicals
through their mouth.
2541.817 And one of the ways that
you can powerfully increase
2545.18 your relationship to that experience
2547.24 and make it much more positive
2549.56 is through just the occasional practice
2551.77 of 10 or 15 sniffs of nothing,
2555.21 which almost sounds ridiculous
like how could that be?
2557.93 But now, you understand why,
2559.21 it's because of the way that
the sniffing action increases
2561.68 the alertness of the brain
2563.07 as well as increasing the
sensitivity of the system.
2566.47 No other system that
I'm aware of in our body
2570.0 is as amenable to these kinds
of behavioral training shifts
2574.3 and allow them to happen so quickly.
2576.07 I would love to be able to tell you
2577.7 that just doing 10 or 15
near-far exercises with a pen
2581.14 or going outside for 10
or 15 seconds each morning
2584.43 is going to completely change
2585.94 the way that you see the world.
2586.87 But it actually isn't the case,
2588.27 you actually, it requires more training,
2590.06 a little bit more effort
in the visual system.
2591.99 In the olfactory system,
2593.247 and your smell system,
and in your taste system
2595.68 just the tiniest bit of
training and attention,
2598.48 and sniffing, inhaling
can radically change
2602.28 your relationship to food
2603.7 such that you actually
start to feel very different
2607.09 as a consequence of ingesting those foods
2608.95 as well as becoming more
discerning about which foods
2612.53 you like and which ones you don't like.
2614.067 And we're going to talk about that
2615.33 because there's a really wonderful thing
2617.32 that happens when you start
developing a sensitive palate
2620.04 and a sensitive sense of smell
2623.16 in a way that allows
you to guide your eating
2626.54 and smelling decisions,
2627.98 and maybe even interpersonal decisions
2629.62 about who you spend time with,
or mate with, or whatever,
2632.9 in a way that is really
in line with your biology.
2636.11 In fact, how well we can
smell and taste things
2639.34 is actually a very strong
indication of our brain health.
2643.52 Now, that's not to say
2644.44 that if you have a poor sense of smell
2646.01 or a poor sense of taste, that
you're somehow brain damaged
2648.74 or you're going to have dementia,
2651.58 although sometimes early signs of dementia
2654.68 or loss of neurons in
other regions of the brain
2657.2 related to say Parkinson's
can show up first
2660.22 as a loss of sense of smell.
2662.68 Again, it's not causal,
2665.27 and it's certainly not
the case that every time
2667.67 you have a sudden loss of smell
2668.86 that there's necessarily brain damage,
2670.33 I want to be very about that,
2672.04 but they are often correlated.
2675.6 There's also a lot of interest right now
2677.14 in loss of sense of smell
2678.53 because one of the early
detection signs of COVID-19
2681.61 was a loss of sense of smell.
2683.49 So, I just briefly want to talk
about loss of sense of smell
2686.68 and regaining sense of smell and taste
2689.34 because these have powerful
implications for overall health.
2693.23 And in fact can indicate
something about brain damage
2696.82 and can even inform how
quickly we might be recovering
2699.76 from something like a concussion.
2702.13 So, our olfactory neurons,
2704.01 these neurons in our
nose that detect odors
2707.49 are really unique among
other brain neurons
2710.84 because they get
replenished throughout life,
2714.75 they don't just regenerate,
but they get replenished.
2718.59 So regeneration is when something
is damaged and it regrows,
2723.11 these neurons are constantly turning
2725.15 over throughout our lifespan,
2726.33 they're constantly being replenished,
2727.89 they're dying off and they're
being replaced by new ones.
2731.38 This is an amazing aspect of our brain
2734.04 that's basically unique to these neurons,
2735.953 there's one other region of the brain
2737.7 where there's a little bit of this maybe,
2739.75 but these olfactory neurons
2742.41 about every three or four weeks they die.
2746.32 And when they die, they're replaced
2748.09 by new ones that come from a
different region of the brain,
2751.99 a region called the subventricular zone.
2753.84 The name isn't as important,
2755.62 but as the phenomenon,
2757.54 but these neurons are
born in the ventricle,
2759.92 the area of your brain that's
a hole that contains...
2762.1 It's not an empty hole,
2763.11 it's a hole basically that
contains cerebral spinal fluid.
2766.03 Well, there's a little
subventricular zone,
2768.07 there's a little zone
below, sub ventricles.
2771.46 And that zone, if you
are exercising regularly,
2775.45 if your dopamine levels are high enough,
2779.89 those little cells there
are like stem cells.
2783.37 They are stem cells and they spit out
2785.4 what are called little neuroblasts,
2787.3 those little neuroblasts migrate
2789.57 into the front of your
brain and then shimmy,
2792.96 they kind of move through
2793.793 what's called the
rostral migratory stream.
2795.86 They kind of shimmy along
2797.39 and land back in your olfactory bulb,
2799.72 settle down and extend little wires
2801.74 into your olfactory mucosa.
2803.87 This is an ongoing process
of what we call neurogenesis
2807.15 or the birth of new neurons.
2809.23 Now, this is really interesting
2812.12 because other neurons in
your cortex, in your retina,
2816.39 in your cerebellum, they do not do this,
2818.51 they are not continually
replenished throughout life.
2821.37 But these neurons, these
olfactory neurons are,
2823.66 they are special.
2826.04 And there are a number of things
2827.76 that seem to increase the amount
2829.85 of olfactory neuron neurogenesis.
2832.23 There is evidence that
exercise, blood flow,
2835.8 can increase olfactory
neuron neurogenesis.
2838.31 Although, those data are fewer
2841.15 in comparison to things
like social interactions,
2844.29 or actually interacting with
odorants of different kinds.
2848.78 So, if you're somebody who
doesn't smell things well,
2851.75 you have a poor sense of smell,
2853.12 your olfactory system
doesn't seem very sensitive,
2855.71 more sniffing, more smelling
is going to be good.
2858.5 And then the molecule
dopamine, this neuromodulator,
2862.36 that is associated with
motivation and drive.
2865.54 And in some cases, if it's
very, very high with mania,
2868.88 or if it's very, very low with
depression or Parkinson's,
2872.11 but for most people where dopamine
2873.85 is in essentially normal ranges
2876.87 dopamine is also a powerful
trigger of the establishment
2881.19 of these new neurons and their migration
2883.03 into the olfactory bulb
and your ability to smell.
2886.89 Now, you don't want to confuse
correlation with causation,
2889.79 so if you're not good at smelling
2891.39 does that mean you have low dopamine?
2892.83 No, not necessarily.
2893.96 If you have low dopamine,
2895.04 does that mean that you
have a poor sense of smell?
2896.86 No, not necessarily.
2898.4 Some people who take
antidepressants of the sort
2901.61 that impact the dopamine
system strongly like Wellbutrin
2905.83 will report a sudden, meaning
within a couple of days,
2909.24 increase in their ability
to smell particular odors,
2913.53 and it's a very striking effect.
2915.72 Some people when they
are in a new relationship
2918.17 because dopamine and the hormones,
2920.11 testosterone and estrogen
are associated with novelty
2924.04 and the sorts of behaviors
that often are associated
2926.85 with new relationships
those three molecules;
2929.67 dopamine, testosterone, and
estrogen kind of work together.
2933.4 And oftentimes people will say
2936.29 or report when they're newly in love
2938.1 or in a new relationship that
they're just obsessed with,
2940.87 or they just so enjoy the
scent of another person
2943.32 so much so that they like to borrow
2945.98 the other person's clothing
2947.2 or they'll sniff the
other person's clothing
2949.04 or they can even just in
the absence of the person
2951.92 they can imagine their smell
and feel a biological response,
2955.65 something that we'll talk more about.
2957.26 So, these neurons turnover
throughout the lifespan
2959.84 and as we age, we actually
can lose our sense of smell.
2963.41 And it's likely, I want
to underscore likely,
2965.58 that that loss of sense of smell as we age
2967.26 is correlated with a loss of other neurons
2969.76 in the retina, in the
ears, a loss of vision,
2972.25 loss of hearing, loss of smell,
loss of the sense apparati
2976.45 which our neurons is
correlated with aging.
2980.45 So, what we've been talking about today
2982.32 is the ability to sense these odors,
2984.45 but what I'd like to do
is empower you with tools
2986.94 that will allow you to keep
these systems tuned up.
2989.01 Last time, we talked about tuning up
2990.7 and keeping your visual
system tuned up and healthy
2993.87 regardless of age.
2994.92 Here, we're talking about really enhancing
2997.75 your olfactory abilities,
your taste abilities as well
3001.99 by interacting a lot with odors,
preferably positive odors,
3007.13 and sniffing more, inhaling more,
3010.27 which almost sounds crazy,
3011.42 but now you understand why.
3013.16 Even though it might sound crazy
3014.2 it's grounded in real mechanistic biology
3016.81 of how the brain wakes up and
responds to these chemicals.
3020.26 Now, speaking of brain injury,
3021.66 olfactory dysfunction is a common theme
3024.61 in traumatic brain injury
for the following reason,
3027.09 these olfactory neurons as I mention
3029.4 extend wires into the mucosa of the nose,
3033.31 but they also extend a
wire up into the skull.
3035.99 And they extend up into the skull
3037.62 through what's called
the cribriform plate,
3039.28 it's like a Swiss cheese type plate
3041.68 where they're going through.
3042.78 And if you get a head hit,
3044.94 that bone, the cribriform plate,
3046.91 sheers those little wires off
3048.597 and those neurons die.
3050.98 Now, eventually they'll be replaced,
3053.1 but there's a phenomenon
by which concussion
3056.34 and the severity of concussion
3057.77 and the recovery from a head injury
3059.71 can actually be gauged in part,
3061.72 in part, not in whole,
3062.74 but in part by how well
or fully one recovers
3066.78 their sense of smell.
3068.48 So, if you're somebody that unfortunately
3069.89 has suffered a concussion,
3071.2 your sense of smell is one readout
3073.82 by which you might evaluate
whether or not you're regaining
3076.41 some of your sensory performance.
3078.03 Of course, there will be others
3078.93 like balance, and cognition,
and sleep, et cetera.
3081.33 But I'd like to refer you
to a really nice paper
3084.98 which is entitled Olfactory Dysfunction
3087.14 in Traumatic Brain Injury:
the Role of Neurogenesis
3090.0 the first author is Marin, M-A-R-I-N.
3093.135 The paper was published
3094.54 in Current Allergy and
Asthma Report, this is 2020.
3098.07 I spent some time with this
paper, it's quite good,
3100.15 it's a review article,
3101.27 I like reviews if they're
peer-reviewed reviews
3104.77 and in quality journals.
3106.48 And what they discuss
3108.14 is and I'll just read here briefly
3109.56 'cause they said it better than I could,
3111.097 "Olfactory functioning
disturbances are common
3113.08 following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
3115.02 and can have a significant
impact on the quality of life.
3117.62 Although there is no standard
treatment for patients
3119.27 with the loss of smell."
3122.59 Now I'm paraphrasing,
"Post-injury olfactory training
3127.42 has shown promise for beneficial effects.
3131.38 Some of this involves,"
3132.88 they go on to tell us
the role of dopamine,
3135.59 dopaminergic signaling,
as I mentioned before,
3137.96 but what does this mean?
3138.93 This means that if
you've had a head injury
3141.94 or repeated head injuries that
enhancing your sense of smell
3145.73 is one way by which you
can create new neurons.
3148.82 And now, you know how to
enhance your sense of smell
3150.75 by interacting with things
that have an odor very closely,
3154.06 and by essentially inhaling more,
3156.81 focusing on the inhale
to wake up the brain
3159.39 and to really focus on some
of the nuance of those smells.
3162.4 So, you might do for instance a smell test
3165.33 by which you smell something like a lemon,
3167.18 put it down, do 10 inhales or so,
3169.33 smell again, et cetera.
3170.89 You might also just
take a more active role
3172.87 in trying to taste and smell your food,
3176.47 and taste and smell various things.
3178.54 I mean, please don't ingest anything
3179.77 that's poisonous that you're
not supposed to be ingesting,
3181.91 but you know what I mean,
3183.09 really tuning up this system,
3184.8 I think is an excellent review,
3186.5 we're going to do an entire episode
3188.13 all about the use of the
visual system in particular,
3190.6 but also the olfactory
system for treatment
3192.46 of traumatic brain injury,
as well as other methods.
3195.02 But I wanted to just mention it here
3197.03 because a number of
people asked me about TBI.
3199.45 And here again, we're in
this place where the senses
3202.65 and our ability to sense these chemicals
3203.703 through these two holes
in the front of our face,
3205.91 our nostrils is a powerful readout
3209.17 and way to control brain function
3211.6 and nervous system function generally.
3213.48 Just a quick note about
the use of smelling salts,
3216.13 I have a feeling that some of
you may be interested in that
3218.7 and its application.
3219.63 If you are interested in that,
3221.36 I recommend you go to the
scientific literature first
3224.42 rather than straight to some vendor
3227.18 or to the what do they call it these days?
3229.85 Costello bro science, he says,
3232.21 bro science, the bro science.
3234.39 You can go to this
paper, which is excellent
3236.47 and is real science, which
is Acute Effects of Ammonia
3238.96 Inhalants on Strength and Power
Performance in Trained Men.
3241.94 It's a randomized controlled
trial, it was published
3243.537 in the Journal of Strength
and Conditioning Research
3245.93 in 2018, and it should
be very easy to find.
3249.13 I will provide a link to
the so-called PubMed ID,
3251.83 which is a string of numbers,
3253.94 and we'll put that in the caption
3254.95 if you want to go
straight to that article,
3256.41 does show a significant what they call,
3259.23 this is what the words they
use literally in quotes,
3261.267 "psyching up effect through the use
3264.54 of these ammonia inhalants
3266.61 and a significant
increase in maximal force
3270.48 in force development in a
variety of different movements."
3274.41 So, for those of you that are interested
3275.88 in ammonia inhalants,
so-called smelling salts,
3279.31 that might be a good reference.
3281.23 The other thing I wanted to talk about
3282.38 with reference to odors is this myth
3285.01 which is that we don't actually
smell things in our dreams,
3288.78 that we don't have a sense of smell.
3291.46 That's pure fiction, I don't
know who came up with that,
3294.38 it's very clear that we are capable
3296.96 of smelling things in our sleep.
3299.49 However, when we are in REM sleep,
3302.01 rapid eye movement sleep,
3303.22 which is the sleep that predominates
3304.84 toward the second half of the night
3308.02 our ability to wake up in
response to odors is diminished.
3312.57 It's not absent, but it's diminished.
3314.5 If smoke comes into the
room, we will likely wake up
3318.04 if the concentration
of smoke is high enough
3319.81 regardless of the stage of sleep we're in,
3322.04 but in REM sleep we tend to be less likely
3325.32 to smell, to sniff.
3328.04 And that actually was measured
in a number of studies
3330.64 that sniffing in sleep is possible.
3333.59 So, if you put an odor like a lemon
3335.36 underneath someone's nostrils
3336.65 in the early portion of
the night, they will smell,
3340.35 and they will later...
3341.48 They will sniff, excuse me,
3343.03 whether or not they smell or
not, I guess depends on them
3345.0 and when they showered last,
3345.91 but they will definitely sniff
3347.61 and they will report later,
especially if you wake them up
3350.94 soon after that, they had a dream
3354.03 or a percept of the scent
of a lemon for instance.
3357.94 Later in the night, it's
harder for that relationship
3360.47 to be established,
3361.303 it's likely that because
of some of the paralysis
3363.21 associated with rapid eye movement sleep,
3365.47 which is a healthy paralysis,
so-called sleep atonia,
3368.52 you don't want to act out
your dreams in REM sleep
3371.02 that there is a less
active tendency to sniff.
3374.88 And actually this has real
clinical implications,
3377.85 the ability to sniff
3380.22 in response to the introduction of an odor
3383.28 is actually one way in
which clinicians assess
3386.99 whether or not somebody's
brain is so-called brain dead.
3391.05 That's not a nice term, but brain dead,
3392.62 or whether or not they have the capacity
3395.05 to recover from things like coma
3397.61 and other states of deep unconsciousness,
3400.27 or I guess you'd call it subconsciousness.
3402.66 So, what will happen is
if someone has an injury
3405.43 and they're essentially out cold,
3408.08 the production of a sniffing reflex,
3411.94 or a sniffing response to say a lemon
3414.76 or some other odor
presented below the nostrils
3417.08 is considered a sign that the
brain is capable of waking up.
3420.89 Now, that's not always the
case, but it's one indication.
3423.78 So just like you could
use mechano sensation,
3427.09 so, a toe pinch for instance,
3429.48 you know, or scraping the
bottom of somebody's barefoot
3432.24 to see if they're conscious,
3434.02 or shining light in their eyes,
3435.85 these are all things that you've seen
3436.81 in movies and television,
3437.82 or maybe if you've seen
in real life as well.
3440.47 Well, odors and chemical
sensing is another way
3443.14 by which you can assess
3444.09 whether or not the brain
is capable of arousal.
3447.01 And actually olfactory stimulation
3449.3 is one of the more prominent ones
3451.09 that's being used in various clinics.
3453.45 As a last point about
specific odors and compounds
3457.12 that can increase arousal and alertness,
3459.48 and this was simply through sniffing them
3461.35 not through ingesting them.
3462.88 There are data, believe it
or not, there are good data
3466.21 on peppermint and the smell of peppermint,
3469.34 minty type sense,
3472.08 whether you like them or
not will increase attention,
3475.75 and they can create the same
sort of arousal response
3479.3 although not as intensely
3480.9 or as dramatically as ammonia
salts can for instance.
3484.31 By the way, please don't
go sniff real ammonia,
3486.54 you could actually damage
your olfactory epithelium
3488.69 if you do that too close to the ammonia.
3490.67 If you're going to use smelling salts
3491.74 be sure you work with someone
3493.48 or you know what you're getting
and how you're using this.
3495.97 You can damage your olfactory pathway
3498.46 in ways that are pretty severe,
3499.56 you can also damage your vision.
3500.98 If you've ever teared up
because you inhaled something
3503.22 that was really noxious,
that is not a good thing,
3507.15 it doesn't mean you
necessarily cause damage,
3508.86 but it means that you have
irritated the mucosal lining
3512.82 and possibly even the
surfaces of your eyes,
3515.53 so please be very, very careful.
3518.17 Scents like peppermint,
3520.37 like these ammonia smelling salts,
3522.37 the reason they wake you up
3523.55 is because they trigger
specific olfactory neurons
3526.69 that communicate with the
specific centers of the brain,
3529.06 namely the amygdala and
associated neurocircuitry
3531.46 and pathways that trigger alertness
3533.44 of the same sort that a
cold shower or an ice bath,
3537.01 or a sudden surprise,
3538.75 or a stressful text message would evoke.
3541.35 Remember, the systems of your
body that produce arousal,
3545.309 and alertness, and attention,
3547.3 and that cue you for
optimal learning, aka focus.
3550.55 Those are very general mechanisms,
3552.09 they involve very basic
molecules like adrenaline
3554.74 and epinephrin same thing actually,
3556.13 adrenaline and epinephrin.
3558.35 The number of stimuli, whether
it's peppermint or ammonia,
3562.21 or a loud blast,
3565.02 the number of stimuli that can evoke
3566.99 that adrenaline response
and that wake up response
3570.06 are near infinite.
3571.62 And that's the beauty
of your nervous system,
3573.63 it was designed to take any
variety of different stimuli
3577.08 placed them into categories,
3578.74 and then evoke different categories
3580.97 of very general responses.
3583.12 Now, you know a lot about olfaction
3584.65 and how the sense of smell works,
3586.05 here's another experiment that you can do.
3588.82 I'll ask you right now.
3590.73 Do you like, hate, or are you indifferent
3594.89 to the smell of microwave popcorn?
3598.48 Some people, including one
member of my podcast staff
3601.8 says it's absolutely disgusting to them,
3604.75 they feel like it's completely nauseating.
3607.83 I don't mind it at all,
3608.663 in fact, I kind of like it.
3609.91 I think the smell of a microwave popcorn
3611.62 is kind of pleasant.
3612.453 I don't particularly like it,
3613.55 but it's certainly not unpleasant.
3617.52 Some people have a gene
that makes them sensitive
3621.77 to the smell of things
like microwave popcorn
3624.39 such that it smells like vomit.
3627.85 I probably don't have that gene
3629.94 because I find the smell
3630.773 of microwaved popcorn pretty pleasant.
3633.67 Some people hate the smell of cilantro,
3637.58 some people ingest asparagus,
3640.53 and when they urinate they
can smell the asparagus
3643.28 in a very pungent way,
3644.68 other people can't smell it at all.
3647.06 These are variants in genes that encode
3650.19 for what are called olfactory receptors.
3653.89 Each olfactory sensory neuron
expresses one odorant gene,
3658.63 one gene that codes for a receptor
3661.27 that responds to a particular odor.
3663.42 If you don't have that gene
3664.84 you will not respond to that odor.
3667.26 So, the reason why some
people find the smell
3670.33 of microwave popcorn to be
very noxious, putrid in fact,
3673.87 is because they have a
gene that allows them
3675.98 to smell the kind of
putrid odor within that.
3680.11 Other people who lack that gene
just simply can't smell it,
3683.53 so we are not all the same
3685.42 with respect to our sensory experience.
3687.36 What one person finds delicious,
3689.43 another person might find disgusting.
3691.14 I'll give a good example
3692.97 which is that I absolutely despise
3695.55 Gorgonzola and blue cheese,
absolutely despise it,
3698.59 it smells and tastes
3701.75 like dirty moldy socks to me.
3704.84 Some people love it, they crave it,
3706.59 actually, some people get
a visceral response to it,
3708.947 and we will talk about how certain tastes
3711.74 can actually evoke very
deep biological responses,
3715.63 even hormonal responses
3717.17 when we talk about taste in a few minutes.
3719.62 But there are these odors,
3721.49 for instance in popcorn
3722.82 it's the molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline,
3727.84 not proline but pyrroline,
3729.78 that gives off to some people like me
3731.75 a toasted smell as the
sugars in the kernels heat,
3734.87 but the compound is also found
3737.32 in things like white
bread and jasmine rice,
3739.36 which don't have as pungent an odor,
3742.01 but some people smell that
and it smells like cat urine.
3746.82 Now, there are scents like
musky scents and musty scents
3752.02 that are secreted by animals like skunks
3754.45 and other animals of the
so-called Mustelidae family.
3757.82 So, these would be ferrets and
other animals that can spray
3761.6 in response to fear, or if they
just want to mark a territory
3765.44 because they want to say that's mine.
3767.12 Dogs incidentally have scent
glands that they rub on things,
3769.7 cats have them too.
3771.12 This musty odor, some people
find actually quite pleasant,
3774.98 some people find it to be very noxious
3777.39 and that will depend of course
on the concentration, right?
3780.76 I'll never forget the first time
3782.44 Costello got sprayed by
a skunk and it was awful.
3786.13 I actually don't mind the
smell of skunk at a distance,
3789.51 it's actually a little bit pleasant,
3790.7 I admit it's a little bit pleasant to me.
3792.84 I don't think that makes me too weird
3794.02 because if you ever read the book
3795.227 "All Quiet on the Western
Front" about World War I,
3798.25 there's a description in
there about the smell of skunk
3800.93 at a distance being mildly pleasant,
3802.87 so the author of that book probably shared
3805.23 a similar olfactory profile
to me, or I to them rather,
3810.02 but some people find even the tiniest bit
3812.41 of the smell of skunk or
musk to be noxious or awful.
3816.41 Now, of course in high
concentrations, it's really awful.
3818.55 And unfortunately, poor Costello,
3819.72 he was like literally
red-eyed and just snorting,
3823.41 and it was awful.
3824.48 There's a joke about
dogs that says that dogs
3827.19 either get skunked one
time and never again
3830.21 or 50 or a hundred times.
3831.5 Costello has been skunked no fewer,
3833.85 I'm not making this up,
3834.73 has been skunked no fewer than 103 times.
3838.16 And that's because if he sees something
3840.5 or hears something in the
bushes, he just goes straight in,
3842.39 he does not learn.
3843.96 But if you like this, that
musty scent or musky scent,
3848.69 well that says something about
the genes that you express
3851.15 in your olfactory neurons,
3852.5 it is completely inherited.
3854.93 And if you don't like that scent,
3856.36 if it's really noxious
3857.45 or you have this response
to microwave popcorn,
3859.19 well, that means you have
a different compliment,
3861.22 a different constellation if you will
3863.77 of genes that make up for
these olfactory sensory neurons
3867.75 and the receptors that they express.
3869.66 Let's talk about taste.
3871.29 Not whether or not you have
taste or you don't have taste,
3873.9 there's no way for me to assess that,
3876.06 but rather how we taste things,
3879.51 meaning how we sense chemicals
in food and in drink.
3884.44 There are essentially five,
3886.18 but scientists now believe
there may be six things
3889.584 that we taste alone or in combination,
3893.89 they are sweet tastes,
3896.46 salty tastes, bitter tastes,
3900.42 sour tastes, and umami taste.
3904.8 Most of you probably
heard of umami by now,
3906.91 it's U-M-A-M-I.
3909.69 Umami is actually the name
for a particular receptor
3914.06 that you express on your tongue
3915.414 that detects savory tastes,
3920.02 so it's the kind of
thing in braised meats.
3922.81 Sometimes people can even
get the activation of umami
3926.92 by tomatoes or tomato sauces.
3931.1 What are each of these tastes
3932.77 and taste receptors responsible for?
3935.03 And then we'll talk about the sixth,
3936.43 maybe you can guess what it is,
3937.53 I don't know if you can guess it now.
3938.76 I couldn't guess it,
but of the five tastes
3942.12 each one has a specific
utility or function.
3946.41 Each one has a particular
group of neurons in your mouth,
3951.0 in your tongue, believe it or not,
3953.31 that responds to particular chemicals
3955.88 and particular chemical structures.
3958.38 It is a total myth, complete fiction,
3961.45 that different parts of your tongue
3963.12 harbor different taste receptors.
3966.062 You know, that high
school textbook diagram
3967.88 that you know sweet is
in one part of the tongue
3969.81 and sour is in another,
3971.4 and bitters in another, complete fiction,
3973.57 just total fiction related
to very old studies
3976.15 that were performed in a
very poorly controlled way,
3978.77 no serious biologists
3980.96 and certainly no one that works on tastes
3982.37 would contend that that's the way
3985.28 that the taste receptors are organized,
3987.0 they are completely
intermixed along your tongue.
3989.46 If you have heightened
or decreased sensitivity
3992.61 to one of those five things I mentioned;
3994.66 sweet, salty, bitter, umami, or sour
3996.66 at one location in your tongue,
3997.86 it likely reflects the
density of overall receptors
4003.17 or something going on in your brain,
4005.9 but not the differential
distribution of those receptors.
4010.52 So, the sweet receptors
are neurons that express
4014.03 a receptor that respond to sugars,
4017.56 in the same way that you
have cones, photoreceptors,
4019.93 in your eye that respond to short,
4021.99 medium, or long wavelength light,
4023.78 meaning blueish, greenish,
or reddish light.
4027.56 You have a neuron, or neurons plural,
4030.962 in your tongue that respond to sugars.
4035.92 And then those neurons,
they don't say sweet,
4038.74 they don't actually send
any sugar into the brain,
4041.21 they send what we call a volley,
4043.22 a barrage of action potentials
of electrical signals
4045.73 off into the brain.
4046.9 It's an amazing system.
4048.55 So, all these receptors in your tongue
4050.4 make up what are called the neurons
4053.36 that give rise to a nerve,
4054.78 a collection of wires, nerve bundles
4057.51 of what's called the gustatory nerve,
4059.84 it goes from the tongue
4061.66 to the so-called nucleus
of the solitary tract.
4064.427 And some of you requested names,
4066.3 I usually don't like to
include too many names
4068.21 for sake of clarity,
4069.13 but the gustatory nerve from the tongue
4071.28 goes to the nucleus of the solitary tract
4073.45 and then to the thalamus
and to insular cortex.
4076.65 You don't have to remember
any of those names
4078.54 if you don't want to,
4079.43 but if you want mechanism,
you want neural circuits,
4081.28 that's the circuit, gustatory
nerve from the tongue,
4084.75 nucleus of the solitary
tract in the brainstem,
4086.6 then the thalamus, and
then insular cortex.
4089.13 And it is in insular cortex,
4090.62 this regenerate cortex that we sort out
4092.73 and make sense of and
perceive the various tastes.
4096.05 Now, it's amazing because
just taking a little bit
4099.64 of sugar or something sour
4101.43 like a little bit of lemon juice
4102.55 and touching it to the tongue
4104.23 within 100 milliseconds, right?
4107.38 Just 100 milliseconds,
far less than one second,
4110.81 you can immediately distinguish
4112.71 ah, that's sour,
4113.73 that sweet, that's bitter, that's umami,
4117.18 and that's an assessment
that's made by the cortex.
4121.66 Now, what to these different
five receptors encode for?
4126.17 Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour,
4127.95 but what are they really looking for?
4129.87 What are they sensing?
4131.51 Well, sweet stuff signals the
presence of energy, of sugars.
4135.86 And while we're all trying
4137.08 or we're told that we
should eat less sugar
4140.24 for a variety of reasons,
4143.07 the ability to sense whether or not a food
4145.1 has rapid energy source
4147.91 or could give rise to glucose is essential
4149.92 so we have sweet receptors.
4151.49 The salty receptors, these
neurons are trying to sense
4155.54 whether or not there are electrolytes
4158.12 in a given food or drink.
4160.81 Electrolytes are vitally important
4162.35 for the function of our nervous system,
4163.66 and for our entire body,
4164.79 sodium is what allows neurons to fire.
4168.18 What allows them to be
electrically active.
4170.6 We also need potassium and magnesium,
4172.31 those are the ions that allow
the neurons to be active.
4175.47 So the salty receptors,
4176.78 the reason that they are there
4178.64 is to make sure that
we are getting enough,
4180.55 but not too much salt,
4182.22 we don't want to ingest
things that are far too salty.
4186.82 Bitter receptors are there
4189.22 to make sure we don't ingest
things that are poisonous.
4192.34 How do I know this?
4193.21 How can I say that?
4194.08 Even though I was definitely not consulted
4196.04 at the design phase, how can I say that?
4197.63 Well, the bitter receptors
4199.88 create a what we call labeled line,
4201.81 a unique trajectory to the neurons
4204.9 of the brainstem that control the [gags],
4207.2 the gag reflex.
4209.35 If we taste something very bitter
4211.5 it automatically triggers the gag reflex.
4214.56 Now, some people like bitter taste,
4215.83 I actually liked the
taste of bitter coffee,
4217.81 children generally like sweet tastes
4219.46 more than bitter tastes,
4220.79 but even babies if they
taste something bitter,
4222.68 they'll just immediately spit it up,
4224.083 it's like the gag reflex.
4226.06 Putrid smells will also
evoke the same neurons,
4229.9 so some people are very sensitive,
4231.69 they have a very sensitive
4233.62 or low threshold vomit reflex,
4236.39 you're going to and there was
somebody in my lab early on.
4239.782 And we never did this intentionally,
and we're just laughing
4241.24 'cause it was so dramatic.
4243.24 How we would have a discussion,
4244.33 someone would say something
about something kind of gross,
4248.16 appropriate for the workplace,
but nonetheless gross,
4250.11 we are biologists,
4251.42 would say something and they
would say, "Stop, stop stop,
4253.61 I'm going to throw up."
4254.71 You know and some people
have a very low threshold
4257.66 quick gag reflex.
4259.78 Other people don't, other people
have a very stable stomach,
4262.96 they don't, you know,
4263.793 they rarely, if ever vomit.
4266.42 The umami receptor isn't sensing savory
4270.06 because the body loves savory,
4272.49 it's because savory is a signal
4274.67 for the presence of amino acids.
4276.83 And we'll talk more about this,
4278.24 but the presence of amino acids
4281.03 in our gut and in our digestive system,
4283.79 and the presence of
fatty acids is essential,
4287.28 there is in fact, no essential
carbohydrate or sugar.
4291.01 Now, I'm not a huge
proponent of ketogenic diets
4293.61 nor am I against them, I
think it's highly individual,
4296.78 you have to decide what's right for you,
4298.83 but everybody needs
amino acids to survive,
4302.1 the brain needs them
and we need fatty acids,
4304.68 especially to build a healthy
brain during development,
4306.93 you need amino acids and fatty acids.
4309.92 And the sour receptor, why
would we have a sour receptor?
4313.33 So, that we could have those
really like sour candies?
4316.13 I think they've gotten more
and more sour over the years.
4317.96 I admit I don't eat candy much,
4320.03 but I do have a particular weakness
4322.6 for like a really good
really sour like gummy peach
4327.96 or they if the gummy cherries are dipped
4329.83 in whatever that sour powder,
4331.21 so I was a kid who I admit it,
4333.03 I liked the LIK-M-AID thing,
4334.36 I'd like drink the powder.
4335.65 Please don't do this, don't
give this garbage to your kids,
4339.838 but I liked it, it was tasty,
4341.72 but sour receptors are not there
4345.06 so that you can ingest
gummy sour gummy peaches
4348.01 or something like that, that's
not why the system evolved,
4351.05 it's there and we know it's there
4354.01 to detect the presence of
spoiled or fermented food.
4358.05 Fermented fruit has a sour element to it,
4360.84 and fermented things while
certainly some fermented foods
4364.18 like sauerkraut, and kimchi,
and things of that sort
4366.21 can be very healthy for us
4367.37 and are very healthy in
reducing inflammation,
4369.35 there's great data on that,
4371.99 pro quality microbiome, et cetera.
4377.72 Fermented fruit can be poisonous, right?
4379.73 Alcohols are poisonous in
many forms to our system
4383.93 and the sour receptor bearing neurons
4388.24 communicate to an area of the brainstem
4390.58 that evokes the pucker response,
4393.35 closing of the eyes and
essentially shutting of the mouth,
4396.6 and cringing away.
4398.08 I think cringe is like a thing now,
4399.3 my niece, whenever I seem to
say something or do something
4402.13 it's either an eye-roll, a
cringe, or both in combination.
4406.5 So the sour, the sweet,
4409.86 the salty, the bitter,
and the umami system,
4412.4 were not there so that we could
have this wonderful pallet
4415.36 of foods that we enjoy so much,
4418.35 they'll allow us to do that,
but they're there to make sure
4420.66 that we bring in certain things
4421.87 to our system and that we
don't ingest other things.
4424.91 Now, what's the sixth sense
4427.71 within the taste system?
4428.94 Not sixth sense generally,
but within the taste system.
4430.81 What's this putative
possible sixth receptor?
4434.48 I already kind of hinted at it
4436.23 when I talked about fatty acids,
4438.2 there are now data to support the idea
4441.87 although there's still more
work that needs to be done
4443.94 that we also have receptors
on our tongue that sense fat.
4448.09 And that because fat is
so vital for the function
4452.28 of our nervous system and
the other organs of our body
4455.21 that we are sensing the
fat content in food,
4457.96 maybe this is why I can only eat half,
4461.27 but no less than half of
a jar of almond butter
4463.61 or peanut butter in one sitting.
4465.26 I just can't, unless it's not salted,
4466.77 in which case, it makes no sense to me.
4468.8 But it's remarkable how that texture,
4473.4 and also the flavor,
but that texture of fat.
4476.51 I love butter, I am guilty,
4478.28 and Costello is definitely
guilty of eating pats of butter
4481.15 from time to time, I
have no guilt about this.
4483.01 People eat pats of cheese,
4484.16 why shouldn't we eat a pat of butter?
4486.25 If you think that's gross
4487.34 then maybe I have a greater abundance
4490.14 of the fat receptors in my tongue,
4492.34 maybe I have a fat tongue than you do.
4495.37 But nonetheless, the ability
to sense fat here in our mouth
4499.63 seems to be critical,
4501.36 you can imagine why that is.
4504.21 I want to talk about the tongue
4506.16 and the mouth as an extension
of your digestive tract.
4509.94 I know that might not be
pleasant to think about,
4512.07 but when you look at it
4513.14 through the lens that
I'm about to provide,
4515.07 it will completely
change the way you think
4516.65 about the gut brain
4517.8 and about all the stuff that you've heard
4519.01 in these recent years about
oh, we have this second brain,
4522.53 it's all these neurons in our gut,
4523.7 I've been chuckling through
these last few years
4527.01 as people have gotten so
excited about the gut brain,
4529.42 not because of their excitement,
4530.82 I think that excitement is wonderful,
4532.28 but we always knew that the nervous system
4534.13 extended out of the
brain and into the body,
4538.44 and people seem kind of overwhelmed
4540.61 and surprised by the idea that
we have neurons in our gut
4543.7 that can sense things like
sugars and fatty acids.
4546.56 And I think those are
beautiful discoveries,
4548.27 don't get me wrong.
4549.103 Diego Bohorquez's lab
out of Duke University
4551.57 has done beautiful studies showing that
4553.81 within the mucosal lining of our gut
4556.39 we have neurons that sense fatty acids,
4558.53 sugars, and amino acids,
4560.9 and that when we ingest something
4562.93 that contains one or two
or three of those things,
4565.51 there's a signal sent via the vagus nerve
4567.97 up into what's called the nodose ganglion,
4570.9 N-O-D-O-S-E,
4573.11 and then into the brain
where it secretes dopamine
4575.57 which makes us want more of that thing,
4577.36 it makes us more motivated to pursue
4579.9 and eat more of that thing,
4581.66 that's either fatty, or umami, savory,
4585.29 or has a sweet taste,
4587.95 any one or two or three
of those qualities,
4591.7 independent of the taste.
4593.55 Now, I think those are beautiful data,
4595.28 but we know that this thing, the mouth.
4598.057 And for those of you listening
4599.11 I've just got my couple
of fingers in my mouth,
4600.67 that's why I sound like I've
got something in my mouth.
4604.8 This thing in the front of our face,
4606.67 we use it for speaking,
4607.61 but it is the front of
our digestive tract.
4609.58 We are essentially a series of tubes
4611.81 and that tube starts with your mouth
4614.5 and heads down into your stomach.
4616.42 And so, that you would sense
4619.13 so much of the chemical constituents
4621.03 of the stuff that you
might bring into your body
4623.75 or that you might want
to expel and not swallow
4626.15 or not interact with by being
able to smell is it putrid?
4629.91 Does it smell good?
4631.4 Does it taste good?
4632.36 Is this safe?
4633.193 Is it salty?
4634.026 Is it so sour that it's fermented
and it's going to poison me?
4637.24 Is it so bitter that it could poison me?
4639.73 Is it so savory that, mmm,
4642.12 yes. I want more and more of this.
4643.91 Well, then you'd want to trigger dopamine,
4645.25 that's all starting in the mouth.
4647.33 So, you have to understand
that you were equipped
4651.12 with this amazing chemical
sensing apparatus,
4654.68 we call your mouth and your tongue.
4656.74 And those little bumps on your tongue
4658.42 that they call the papillae,
4659.96 those are not your taste buds.
4661.57 Surrounding those little papillae
4664.38 like little rivers are these
little dents and indentations.
4668.22 And what dents and
indentations do in a tissue
4670.92 is they allow more surface area,
4672.52 they allow you to pack more receptors.
4674.72 So, down in those grooves are
where all these little neurons
4677.65 and their little processes are
4680.65 with these little receptors
4681.71 for sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour,
4683.67 and maybe fat as well.
4685.007 And so, it's this incredible device
4686.75 that you've been equipped with,
4688.05 that you can use to interact
4689.55 with various components
of the outside world
4692.0 and decide whether or not you
want to bring them in or not.
4695.35 Just as you can lose
those olfactory neurons,
4697.67 if you happen to get hit on the head
4699.66 or you have some other thing,
4702.08 maybe it was an infection that caused loss
4704.04 of those olfactory sensory neurons,
4706.01 you can also lose taste
receptors in your mouth.
4709.68 If you've ever eaten
something that's too hot,
4713.87 not spicy hot, but too hot,
4716.34 you burn your tongue, you burn receptors.
4720.04 It takes about a week to
recover those receptors.
4723.55 For some people it's a
little bit more quickly,
4725.87 but if you burn your tongue badly
4727.84 by ingesting a soup that's too hot
4729.38 or a beverage that's too hot,
4730.46 you will greatly reduce
your sense of taste
4733.12 for essentially all tastes.
4736.72 And that's because those
neurons sit very shallow
4741.32 beneath the tongue's surface,
4742.95 and so that if you put
something too hot on,
4744.28 you literally just burn
those neurons away.
4746.06 Luckily those neurons also
can replenish themselves.
4749.41 Those neurons are of the
peripheral nervous system,
4752.79 and like all peripheral system neurons
4754.78 they can replenish or regenerate.
4757.55 So, if you burn your mouth
in about a week or so
4760.14 hopefully sooner you'll
be able to taste again.
4763.06 In fact, everybody's ability to taste
4767.0 is highly subject to training.
4769.1 You can really enhance
your ability to taste
4771.45 and taste the different component
parts of different foods
4775.2 simply by paying attention to
what you're trying to taste,
4778.92 this is an amazing aspect
of the taste system.
4782.37 I think more than any other system,
4784.16 the taste system and perhaps
the smell system as well
4787.2 can be trained so that you can
learn to pick out the tones,
4792.33 if you will of different ice cream,
4795.97 or different beverages.
4798.56 I'm somebody who, you know,
4799.67 I don't drink much alcohol,
4800.8 I'll occasionally have
a drink or something,
4802.46 but a while ago I got to
taste a bunch of different
4807.44 white tequilas, these are
different kinds of tequilas
4809.86 that are, they're not
brown, they're white.
4811.72 And I sort of assumed that
all tequila was disgusting,
4815.97 that was my assumption before doing this.
4816.84 And then I tasted a
couple of white tequilas
4818.76 and I realized oh, those
aren't aren't too bad.
4820.53 I tasted a few more,
4822.12 and then pretty soon I
could really start to detect
4824.52 the nuance and the difference.
4825.84 Now, I haven't had a
tequilas in a long time,
4828.06 now I sort of tend to not
drink at all these days,
4830.53 but in a very short period
of time like a couple of days
4833.3 I got very good at detecting
which things I liked
4835.84 and I could start to pick out tones.
4837.69 So, I'm not a wine drinker,
4839.19 but for those of you that are,
4840.7 you know, you hear about
oh, it has floral tones,
4842.82 or berry tones, or chocolate tones.
4844.85 You know, some of that is
just kind of menu-based
4848.71 and kind of marketing-based silliness
4851.29 designed to get you excited
4852.97 about what you're about to ingest.
4854.24 But some of it is real,
4855.72 and for people that are skilled
4857.41 in assessing wines or assessing foods.
4861.13 I'm much more of an eater than a drinker,
4863.15 you can really start to
develop a sensitive palate,
4866.04 a nuanced palette through what
we call top-down mechanisms.
4869.62 This olfactory cortex
that takes these five,
4873.03 maybe the sixth fat receptor too,
4874.9 information and tries to make sense
4877.51 of what's out there in the world.
4879.0 And what its utility is,
is it good? Is it bad?
4882.41 Do I want more of it or less than it?
4884.2 That neural circuitry is
unlike other neural circuitry
4887.78 in that it seems very amenable
4889.72 to behavioral plasticity
for whatever reason,
4893.29 and we could talk about
what those reasons might be.
4895.61 You know, it's interesting sometimes
4896.87 to think about how your taste
literally, chemical taste,
4901.23 is probably very different
than that of other people,
4903.88 how a food tastes to you
is probably very different
4906.71 than how it tastes to somebody else.
4907.93 The same probably cannot
be said of something
4910.24 like vision or hearing,
unless you're somebody
4912.7 who has perfect pitch or your
color vision is disrupted,
4916.75 or you're a mantis shrimp,
4917.97 chances are when we
look at the same object
4920.16 two people are seeing more
or less the same object
4923.06 or perceiving it in a very similar way.
4925.4 There are experiments that
essentially establish that.
4928.08 Now we, have taste receptors
4930.18 and a lot of those tastes receptors,
4931.06 their chemical structures are known,
4933.16 they come with fancy names
like the T1R1 or the T1R2,
4937.94 which were identified as the
sweet and umami receptors.
4941.98 So, what's interesting
is that this umami flavor
4945.14 is the savory flavor rather
4946.883 that's sensed by umami
receptors is very close
4950.4 to the receptor that detects sweet things.
4954.5 Similarly, bitter is sensed
4957.39 by a whole other set of receptors.
4959.63 Now, there's a fun naturally
occurring experiment
4962.8 that will forever change the
way that you look at animals,
4967.03 and the way certainly
that I think about dogs
4969.21 and Costello in particular.
4971.47 Carnivorous large animals like tigers
4975.39 and some grizzly bears for instance,
4978.08 we know that they have no
ability to detect sweet,
4982.07 they don't actually have the receptors
4984.34 for sweet on their tongue,
4986.79 but their concentration of umami receptors
4989.43 of their ability to detect savory
4992.1 is at least 5,000 times
that which it is in humans.
4996.88 In other words, if I eat
a little piece of steak,
5000.52 or Costello eats a little piece of steak,
5003.77 that steak probably tastes much,
5006.4 much more savory than it does to me.
5011.03 So dogs, and tigers, and bears, et cetera,
5015.05 they're going to taste savory
things and smell savory things
5018.51 with a much higher degree of sensitivity,
5021.03 but they can't taste sweet things.
5022.64 Other large animals, which
are mostly herbivores
5025.33 like the panda bear for instance.
5028.25 It's hard to believe that
thing is even a bear,
5030.11 I got nothing against pandas,
5031.52 I just think that they
get a little bit too much
5033.67 of the limelight frankly.
5035.99 So, no vendetta against
Panda, save the pandas,
5038.23 I hope they replenish all the pandas,
5039.48 but pandas in all their whatever
5044.02 have no umami receptors,
they can't taste savory,
5047.62 but they have greatly heightened
density of sweet receptors.
5051.74 So, there they are eating
these whatever bamboos all day
5054.76 or not bamboozle, but bamboos all day
5058.39 and they can taste things
that are very sweet
5062.0 with a much higher degree of intensity.
5064.66 And in general, animals
that are more gentle
5069.99 that are herbivores, excuse me.
5072.3 Or animals that have the
propensity for aggression,
5075.01 that's where you really see the divergence
5076.73 of the umami receptor
5078.06 because it's associated
with meat and amino acids.
5080.7 And where you see the enhancement
of the sweet receptors
5084.41 for animals that eat a
lot of plants and fruits,
5087.11 and they probably taste
very different to them
5089.34 than they do to you and me.
5091.04 And, so it's interesting to note
5093.07 that animals that eat meat,
that eat other organisms
5097.2 can actually extract more
savory experience from that.
5100.25 What does this mean for you?
5101.5 All right, do you associate
yourself as a tiger,
5104.32 or a grizzly bear, or a panda,
or a combination of both?
5106.87 Most people are omnivores.
5108.44 However, you may find it
interesting that people
5112.06 that for instance eat a
pure carnivore type diet
5115.99 or a keto diet where they
are ingesting a lot of meat,
5119.33 so therefore are sensing
a lot of umami flavors.
5122.63 And I realized not everyone
who's keto eats meat,
5125.42 but those who do that will
develop a more sensitive palate
5129.28 and likely there are some
data, although early data,
5132.49 craving for umami-like foods.
5135.32 Whereas people that eat
a more plant-based diet
5138.96 are likely developing a
heightened sensitivity
5143.5 and desire for, and maybe even
dopamine response to sugars
5147.49 and plant-based foods.
5149.1 Now, this is my partial
attempt to reconcile
5152.21 the kind of online battle
that seems to exist
5155.49 between plant-based versus animal-based,
5159.27 purely plant-based or
purely animal-based diets.
5162.11 I think most people are omnivores,
5163.89 but it's kind of interesting to think
5165.183 that the systems are plastic
5168.27 such that people might want more meat
5170.45 if they eat more meat,
5171.38 people might want more plants
5172.82 if they eat enough plants
for a long period of time.
5175.55 And this might explain some
of the chasm that exists
5178.33 between these two groups.
5179.8 Now, this is not to say
anything about the ethical
5183.05 or the environmental
impacts of different things,
5184.75 I don't even want to get into that
5185.87 because the meat people say
that the plant-based diets
5188.1 have as much a negative impact
5189.71 as the plant people say
that the meat based diets,
5191.64 that's a totally different discussion.
5193.13 What I'm talking about here is
food craving and food seeking
5196.75 and one's ability to detect
these umami, savory flavors
5200.49 is going to be enhanced
by ingesting more meat
5202.77 and less activation of
the sweet receptors.
5205.51 So in other words, the more meat you eat
5207.41 the more you're going to become
like a tiger, so to speak.
5210.88 And the more that you avoid
these umami flavors and meats
5215.01 and the more that you
would eat plant-based foods
5217.37 and in particular sweet foods,
5218.86 the more you will likely
suppress that umami system
5222.55 and that you will have
a heightened desire for,
5226.53 appetite for and sensing of sweet foods
5229.94 or foods that contain sugars.
5231.98 What I'm about to tell you
is going to seem crazy,
5235.14 but is extremely interesting
5237.57 with respect to taste and taste receptors.
5241.11 Remember, even though we can enjoy food
5244.1 and we can evolve our sense
5245.42 of what's tasty or not tasty,
depending on life decisions,
5249.13 environmental changes, et cetera,
5251.04 the taste system just
like the olfactory system
5252.747 and the visual system
5254.19 was laid down for the purpose
5256.66 of moving towards things
that are good for us
5259.42 and moving away from
things that are bad for us,
5261.41 that's the kind of core
function of the nervous system.
5265.56 Well, taste receptors are not
just expressed on the tongue,
5270.87 they are expressed in other
cells and other tissues as well.
5274.2 Some of you may be able to imagine foods
5277.1 that are so delicious to you
5278.47 that they make your entire body feel good.
5281.61 Or foods that are so
horrifically awful to think about
5286.44 let alone taste, that they
create a whole body shuddering
5290.34 or kind of repellent-type response
5292.73 where you just either cringe
or turn your face away
5295.81 even in the absence of that food.
5297.68 That's sort of how I feel about
pungent, Gorgonzola cheese.
5301.75 If you like Gorgonzola
cheese, I don't judge you,
5305.49 I just, that's an individual difference.
5307.61 I happen to love certain foods,
5309.62 I do like savory foods very much.
5312.89 I, when I think about them,
5314.53 they just they make me feel good.
5317.02 And I'm oftentimes not even associating
5319.97 with the taste of those foods,
5321.29 it feels almost like a visceral thing.
5323.56 Well, it turns out that
some of the taste receptors
5325.75 extend beyond the tongue,
5327.45 that they actually can extend
5329.14 into portions of the gut
and digestive system.
5332.11 And if that's not strange enough,
5335.49 turns out that some of the taste receptors
5337.32 are actually expressed on
the ovaries and the testes.
5342.77 So, what that means is that the gonads,
5344.75 the very cells, and tissues,
and organs in our body
5348.15 that make up the reproductive axis
5351.01 are expressing taste receptors.
5353.08 Okay, so how do we interpret this?
5354.25 Does this mean that when you eat something
5355.91 that's very savory or
very sweet for instance,
5359.21 that it's triggering activation
5361.35 of the ovaries or of the testes?
5364.45 Well, it's possible.
5367.02 Now, how those molecules,
5369.26 those chemical molecules
would actually get there
5371.36 isn't clear, the digestive
track does not run directly
5374.78 to the testes or to the ovaries.
5376.86 But nonetheless, what this
means is that chemical sensing
5380.06 of the very things that
we detect on our tongue
5381.937 and that we call taste in quotes in food
5386.7 is also evoking
5389.52 cellular responses within
the reproductive gonads.
5394.48 Now, whether or not this
underlies the positive association
5397.57 that we have with certain
foods isn't clear,
5400.33 but I'd be remiss if I
didn't point out the obvious,
5404.63 which is that the relationship
between the sensual nature
5410.01 of particular foods
5411.96 and sensuality generally
and the reproductive axis
5416.2 is something that's been
covered in many movies,
5419.15 there are entire movies that are focused
5421.29 on the relationship between for instance,
5423.72 chocolate and love and
reproductive behaviors,
5426.97 or certain feasts of meat
5430.96 and their wonderful tastes
5433.36 and the kind of sensuality around feasts
5436.67 of different types of foods,
5438.52 but in general, it's the
sweet and the savory,
5441.79 rarely is it the sour or the
bitter, the salty or the fat.
5446.23 And not surprisingly perhaps,
5449.29 it is the T2Rs and the T1Rs,
5451.603 the receptors that are
associated with the sweet
5454.58 and with the umami, the savory flavors
5457.61 that are expressed not just on the tongue
5459.74 and in portions of the digestive tract,
5462.09 but on the gonads themselves.
5464.31 So, what does this mean?
5465.38 Does this mean that eating certain foods
5466.99 can stimulate the gonads?
5468.76 Maybe, there's no data that immediately
5470.66 support that right now, but
this is an emerging area.
5474.69 If you'd like to read more about this
5477.12 there's a great review,
5478.76 entitled Taste perception:
From the tongue to the testis,
5481.99 although they do also
talk about the ovaries.
5484.77 Why they didn't include that in the title
5486.21 is I think a reflection
of the bias of the author.
5489.73 The author indeed not
incidentally is Feng Li,
5494.045 last name L-I.
5496.361 It's a very interesting paper published
5498.55 in Molecular Human Reproduction.
5502.2 You can find it easily
online, it's downloadable,
5504.19 I'll also provide a link to it.
5506.0 I just think it's fascinating
5507.65 that these taste receptors are
expressed in other tissues.
5510.07 And I should mention
that they're expressed
5511.35 in tissues of other areas
of the body as well,
5514.53 including the respiratory system,
5516.82 but the richest aggregation
5520.42 or concentration of these receptors
5521.87 for umami and sweet of
course is on the tongue,
5524.13 but also on the gonads.
5525.78 And I think it does speak
5527.18 to the possible bridge between
5529.69 what we think of as a sensory
5532.19 or a sensual experience of food
5534.51 and the deeper kind of
visceral sense within the gut,
5538.09 and maybe even within the gonads as well
5540.09 of something that we find
extremely pleasurable,
5542.64 or even appetitive that
we want to move toward it.
5546.32 We are actually going to
return to that general theme
5548.85 in the discussion about touch sensation.
5552.24 Some people for instance,
5554.58 when they touch certain
surfaces like furs,
5558.09 or sheep skins, or velvet,
5561.41 or soft, smooth surfaces
5563.63 it feels good elsewhere in their body,
5566.27 not just at the point of
contact with that surface.
5570.77 And similarly, if there's the...
5574.18 How about this one?
5575.013 The screech of chalk on a
chalkboard, it's a sound,
5578.12 but it has a very strong
visceral component,
5580.77 or sandpaper, like
fingernails on a chalkboard,
5584.48 not the sound, but the feeling, right?
5586.66 Exactly, so our whole
nervous system is tuned
5589.52 to either be drawn toward appetitive,
5592.38 or repelled by aversive behaviors, right?
5595.86 So there's this push-pull that exists,
5597.81 and what I'm referring to
in terms of these receptors
5599.97 on the tongue that are also
expressed on the gonads
5602.14 is yet another example of
what at least in this case
5604.39 seems to be an appetitive thing,
5606.78 a desire to move toward certain foods
5609.54 and maybe even the experiences
5610.86 that are associated with those foods.
5612.43 I want to talk about a particular aspect
5614.33 of food and a chemical reaction in cooking
5617.72 called the Maillard reaction.
5619.34 Some of you have probably
heard of the Maillard reaction,
5621.58 it's spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D.
5625.58 The D is silent, so don't
call it the Maillard reaction,
5628.77 and it's not the Maillard reaction,
5631.07 it is the Maillard reaction.
5632.73 And the Maillard reaction is a reaction
5635.02 that for the aficionados is
a non-enzymatic browning.
5638.57 The other form of non-enzymatic
browning is caramelization,
5641.76 although when you hear caramel, carmel,
5644.79 I think it's caramel.
5646.0 You think sweet, and indeed
caramelization is a sugar-sugar
5651.16 chemical interaction that leads
to a kind of nicely toasted
5655.66 not burnt, but nicely toasted sweet taste.
5658.68 Whereas the Maillard reaction
is that really savory reaction
5662.53 that occurs when you have a
sugar amino acid reaction.
5665.41 Remember, we have neurons in our gut,
5667.01 but also neurons in our tongue
5669.37 and neurons deep in the brain
that are comparing the amount
5672.61 of sugar to savory.
5675.84 Okay, and the Maillard
reaction is very interesting
5678.55 for you chemists out there,
5680.0 this is going to be way too elementary.
5681.47 And for you non-chemists
5682.4 it's probably going to be
a little bit of a reach,
5683.99 but just bear with me, all
these chemicals that we sense
5687.32 have a different structure,
5688.44 it's like hydrogens, and oxygens,
5689.99 and aldehyde groups, and all these things.
5691.38 And basically the Maillard reaction
5693.04 involves what's called a free aldehyde.
5695.07 If you didn't like chemistry,
don't worry about it,
5697.59 it's basically got a group
there that kind of sits open
5701.09 that allows it to interact
5702.53 with other things and actually
through the use of heat
5705.76 and the process that we call brazing,
5708.67 which I'll talk about in a moment
5710.22 you create a what's called a ketone group.
5713.12 Now, most people now have heard of ketones
5714.74 'cause they think about
the ketogenic diet,
5716.68 but a ketone group is
actually a chemical compound
5720.65 that can be used for energy,
5721.98 and that's why people say you
can use ketones for energy,
5724.46 but if you've ever actually
encountered ketones,
5728.14 if you for instance, get liquid ketones,
5730.701 a ketone ester, and you smell it,
5732.88 what does it smell like?
5734.13 It smells a little bit like an alcohol,
5736.55 but it has a kind of savory taste,
5739.95 even when you smell it.
5741.48 Okay, there are other smells
that have these tastes too,
5744.19 but for the Maillard reaction
5746.24 which could be created for instance
5747.93 like if you took a piece of meat,
5749.27 or if you're not a meat eater
5750.44 if you took tomatoes and
you cook them in a pan
5753.05 and you cooked it nice and
slow till it's simmered
5754.97 and almost started to brown
and burn a little bit.
5757.23 Usually if I do it burns,
I'm not a good cook
5760.14 as Costello points out a lot,
5762.05 but it gets that like almost
tangy, very umami-like flavor.
5767.81 And sometimes it will
even stick to the pan,
5770.02 if you scrape it off
5771.227 and actually you can
taste it in your mouth
5773.43 as you're cooking it.
5774.64 That's the Maillard reaction,
5775.9 that's that free aldehyde group,
5777.28 and that's the production
of a ketone group.
5781.03 When you smell ketones, it
smells very much like that.
5785.32 Okay, some people talk about the ketones
5787.26 will produce like fruity breath.
5788.8 And that's true if people
are really far into ketosis,
5791.12 their breath has a kind of fruity odor,
5792.61 that's a little bit of a different thing.
5794.33 So, the relationship
between smell and taste
5796.94 is a very, very close one.
5799.43 And this is why when people drink wine
5800.96 they often will inhale and then sip,
5803.49 some of that is just kind of like pomp
5805.12 and circumstance frankly,
they make a big deal of it,
5808.35 but they can sense
things with their mouth.
5812.23 The combination of odor receptors
5815.14 being activated in a particular way,
5817.24 and taste receptors in
the mouth being activated
5819.44 in a particular way,
triggers the activation
5821.72 of multiple brain areas that
are associated with taste,
5824.58 and circuitry within the body
5826.82 that's associated with the behaviors
5829.15 that relate to that taste
like leaning toward it,
5831.98 or leaning away from it
5833.11 depending on whether or not
it's appetitive or aversive.
5835.97 So the Maillard reaction is
a very interesting reaction
5838.87 involving this sugar amino acid thing,
5841.9 but really it's what it's
doing is heating up food
5845.15 such that the amino
acids are more available
5849.9 literally in their chemical form
5851.37 for detection by the neurons.
5853.4 This is a phenomenon that occurs
5854.69 in other domains of the taste system.
5857.87 For instance, a lot of what's happened
5860.43 with highly processed foods
5862.91 is that manufacturers have figured out
5865.7 how to trigger more dopamine response
5868.37 by ingestion of these sugary
foods and created textures,
5872.39 and created essentially design
of foods for two purposes.
5875.76 I'm not out to completely
demonize processed food,
5878.95 I did that in a previous episode,
5880.75 but processed foods are
really designed to take foods
5884.54 that ordinarily would spoil,
that would have a shelf life
5886.74 and extend their shelf life
5887.72 to turn foods which are not
a commodity into a commodity.
5890.74 Something could be stored and
used essentially as a tradable
5896.31 purchasable, sellable resource.
5899.16 In doing that they change,
5900.53 they've also decided to change the texture
5902.6 so that you want to chew more of them.
5904.77 Like I have this thing
5905.7 I don't know what it is for
those Triscuit crackers.
5908.9 I don't know why are those things so good?
5910.16 It's probably the
texture, got those layers,
5912.33 they're just kind of perfectly salty.
5913.83 I haven't had one in a long time,
5914.84 so I bet if I had one now
it wouldn't taste as good
5916.82 as I'm imagining it.
5918.04 But those combinations of
texture, smell, and taste
5922.61 are what combine to activate
these different brain areas
5924.83 that make you really
want to desire something.
5927.47 And the people who make foods,
5929.13 processed foods in particular,
5930.91 are phenomenally good at figuring out
5933.63 what drives the dopamine
system and makes you want more
5936.07 of these things either
because of the way they taste
5938.76 and/or because of the
way they trigger neurons
5940.67 in your gut that have
nothing to do with taste
5942.5 that simply make you
desire more of the food.
5944.65 In other words, many of the
foods that are processed foods
5948.42 make you desire more of them,
5950.39 it's impossible to eat
one chip kind of thing.
5953.3 Not because they taste good,
5954.61 but because in your gut
they're activating the neurons
5957.66 that activate dopamine
5958.66 which make you seek more of those foods
5960.91 independent of blood
sugar or anything else.
5963.87 So, you may actually be
eating more particular foods
5966.73 not because they taste good,
5968.62 but because they feel good
on your tongue and mouth,
5972.85 and because the neurons in your gut
5974.83 which are totally independent
of conscious taste
5977.18 are triggering the release of dopamine
5978.73 which is a molecule that
makes you seek more of,
5981.37 and do more of anything
5982.5 that led to the ingestion of that food.
5985.01 There's a fun experiment that you can do,
5987.32 which is to completely invert
your sense of sweet and sour,
5993.16 there's actually a way to do this readily.
5994.98 When I was a post-doc,
5996.86 I used to have a journal club at my house,
5999.01 people would come over in
the evening once a month,
6001.9 and we would read a paper,
6003.2 typically the weirdest paper we could find
6005.17 and we would eat food and hang out,
6008.147 that's what nerds did and do for fun,
6011.71 so that's what we did.
6012.92 And one time someone brought
what's called miracle berry.
6017.53 Okay, so this isn't some
psychedelic plant medicine thing,
6020.03 miracle berry, you can purchase online,
6022.43 it's relatively inexpensive.
6024.5 It actually causes a change
6026.47 in the configuration of taste receptors
6030.11 such that when you eat
something sour, it tastes sweet.
6033.64 And so what's really wild
is you ingest miracle berry,
6037.29 and then you bite into a lemon,
6039.41 maybe even the lemon and peel
6040.8 and it tastes as sweet as a peach.
6043.21 And this effect lasts several hours.
6046.91 Definitely, you know, check any warnings,
6048.5 I don't know what sort of warnings these,
6050.08 a miracle berry carries,
6051.16 but I'm sure there's always
something, you can imagine.
6054.66 There are a number of
papers on miracle berry
6056.64 or miracle fruit it's called,
6059.36 but it changes your perception of sour
6062.35 at a perceptual level,
6064.5 but it does that by changing the activity
6067.07 of the receptors in the mouth and tongue.
6069.59 Now, this is important as a
principle and it's underscored
6072.41 by experiments that have
been done by for instance
6074.58 Charles Zuker's lab at
Columbia University,
6076.91 where they've essentially
genetically engineered animals
6080.21 such that the bitter receptor is swapped
6083.34 with the sweet receptor,
6084.45 or the sweet receptor is swapped
with the bitter receptor.
6086.72 And what they show is
that the actual food,
6090.06 the experience on the tongue
6092.4 drives different pathways in the brain.
6095.04 Here's what they did,
they essentially took mice
6097.73 and swapped out the sweet receptor
6099.37 and put in a bitter receptor.
6100.67 And then what they found is that
6102.08 whereas normally mice
would actively seek out
6105.61 and even work for sugar water, sucrose,
6108.27 they really like that.
6109.54 If they replace the sweet
receptor with the bitter receptor,
6112.31 the mice would avoid sugar water.
6113.96 And the reverse was also true,
6115.17 that mice would drink a
bitter solution avidly,
6118.25 they liked a bitter solution
6119.58 if they swapped out the bitter
receptor for sweet receptor.
6123.06 What this means is that
our entire experience
6125.01 of what we taste is dependent
6126.38 on how we experience that
taste the level of the tongue.
6129.49 And so, you're hopefully not
going to do genetic engineering
6132.62 of your taste receptors,
6133.84 but if you'd like to do
this sort of experiment
6136.19 you actually can do it very
easily using miracle fruit,
6138.8 the instructions of how
much to ingest, et cetera,
6141.72 any safety concerns are
usually on the package
6143.926 and should be easy to find.
6146.15 And there's a lot of science
to support how this works,
6148.29 it's kind of a fun
experiment that anyone can do
6151.29 and will completely change your perception
6153.28 of any food that you're
accustomed to eating.
6155.49 In fact, you can figure out how much sweet
6158.8 or the sense of sweetness
6160.62 is contributing to your
experience of a food,
6163.02 even if you don't think
of it as a sweet food
6165.0 through this miracle fruit experiment.
6167.28 You could take miracle fruit,
6168.32 you could eat a slice of
pepperoni pizza or cheese pizza,
6171.24 which perhaps normally to you
would taste just like pizza,
6174.81 and you'll notice it
tastes very different.
6176.99 What you are detecting is
how much the sense of sweet
6181.27 was contributing to
that particular flavor.
6184.59 Now, I'd like to return to pheromones.
6187.91 As I mentioned earlier,
6189.13 true pheromonal effects are
well-established in animals.
6192.62 And one of the most
remarkable pheromone effects
6195.12 that's ever been described
6196.1 is one that actually I've
mentioned before on this podcast,
6198.33 but I'll mention again just briefly,
6200.07 which is the Coolidge effect.
6201.63 The Coolidge effect is the effect
6203.6 of a male of a given species,
6206.89 in most cases, it tended to be
a rodent or a rooster mating.
6213.01 And at some point reaching exhaustion
6215.96 or the inability to mate again
6218.02 because they just simply
couldn't for whatever reason.
6221.36 The Coolidge effect establishes
that if you swap out the hen
6226.66 with a new hen, or the female
rat or mouse with a new one
6230.21 then the rat or the rooster
6233.86 spontaneously regains
their ability to mate,
6236.4 somehow their vigor is returned,
6238.52 the refractory period after
mating that normally occurs
6242.14 is abolished and they can mate again.
6245.6 It turns out that the Coolidge effect
6246.95 runs in the opposite direction too.
6249.06 I did not know this, but I
recently learned of a study,
6251.6 it was actually done in
hamsters, not in in mice,
6254.33 but it turns out that females also will,
6257.58 female rodents will mate to exhaustion.
6259.99 And at some port...
6261.01 At some point, excuse me,
6262.22 they will refuse to mate any longer
6264.13 unless you swap in a new male.
6266.22 And then because mating in rodents
6268.61 involves the female being receptive,
6270.32 there are certain number of behaviors
6271.9 that mean that tell you that she's willing
6274.88 and wanting to mate,
so-called lordosis reflex.
6279.97 Then if there's a new male,
6282.17 she will spontaneously
regain the lordosis reflex
6286.34 and the desire to mate.
6287.37 And how do you know this?
6289.55 How do we know it's a pheromonal effect?
6291.38 Well, this recovery of the
desire and ability to mate
6295.01 both in males and in females
6298.28 can be evoked completely by the odor
6301.61 of a new male or female,
6303.6 it doesn't even have
to be the presentation
6305.04 of the actual animal.
6306.21 And that's how you know
6307.043 that it's not some visual interaction
6308.51 or some other interaction,
6309.8 it's a pheromonal interaction.
6312.04 Now, as I mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects
6314.16 in humans have been debated
for a long period of time.
6317.64 We are thought to have a vestigial,
6319.76 meaning a kind of shrunken down
6322.97 miniature accessory olfactory
bulb called Jacobson's organ,
6327.21 or the vomeronasal organ.
6329.6 Some people don't believe
that Jacobson's organ exists,
6331.8 some people do, there is
anatomical evidence for it
6335.22 in some cadavers.
6337.04 It sits not very high up in the brain
6341.09 or where your olfactory bulb is,
6342.84 but it's actually in the nasal passages,
6345.43 so there's like little dents
6346.72 as you go up through your nasal passages,
6348.48 and there is evidence of
something that's vomeronasal-like.
6352.79 Vomeronasal is the pheromonal organ,
6354.59 they call it Jacobson's organ
if it's present in humans,
6357.26 kind of tucked into some of the
divots in the nasal passage.
6361.77 Even if that organ,
Jacobson's organ isn't there
6366.71 or is not responsible
6367.95 for the chemical signaling
between individuals,
6370.86 there is chemical signaling
between human beings.
6373.42 As I mentioned earlier,
the effect of tears
6376.76 in suppressing the areas of the brain
6378.803 that are involved in sexual desire
6381.83 and testosterone of males,
that's a concrete result,
6385.65 that's a very good result
published by an excellent group
6388.56 with no pre-existing bias going in,
6390.3 that's just what they found.
6392.2 There is also evidence
6395.48 both for and against
6397.97 chemical signaling between females
6400.46 in terms of synchronization
of menstrual cycles.
6402.99 Now, the original paper on
this was published in the 1970s
6406.85 by McClintock, and it essentially said
6410.08 that when women live together
in group housing, dormitories,
6414.58 and similar that their menstrual
cycles were synchronized
6417.04 and that was due to what was hypothesized
6418.93 to be pheromonal effects.
6420.63 Over the years,
6421.463 that study has been
challenged many, many times.
6424.87 The more recent data point to the idea
6427.81 that there is chemical-chemical
signaling between women
6431.03 in ways that impact the
timing of the menstrual cycle,
6434.45 but that depending on whether or not
6437.04 some of the women are
in the ovulation phase,
6440.01 the ovulatory phase of that cycle
6441.59 or whether or not they are
in the follicular phase,
6443.47 the phase when the follicle is maturing
6446.12 before the egg actually obviates.
6451.29 So two separate phases of
the 28 day menstrual cycle
6455.59 will either lengthen or
shorten the menstrual cycle
6459.93 of the person that smells those women.
6462.03 Translated into English what that means
6463.65 is that it is very likely it seems
6466.27 that something, maybe pheromones,
6467.99 but maybe some other chemical
6469.34 that is independent of
pheromones is being conveyed
6472.19 between women that are housed together
6475.87 or spend a lot of time together
6477.52 to shift their menstrual cycle,
6479.01 but it doesn't necessarily
mean that they synchronize.
6482.16 So for instance, if one woman
is in the follicular phase
6485.96 of the menstrual cycle,
6487.9 it might shorten or delay ovulation.
6491.66 Excuse me, it might accelerate
ovulation in another woman,
6494.86 whereas if somebody is
in the ovulatory phase
6497.05 of their cycle, it might
lengthen the menstrual cycle
6501.12 out so that they, the woman
who smells that person's scent
6505.71 or who smells her sweat,
6507.41 we still don't know the
origin of the chemical
6509.08 would ovulate later.
6510.6 So, all of this is to say
6511.95 is that chemical-chemical
signaling is happening
6514.02 from females to males
through tears, we know that.
6516.6 Is that a pheromonal effect?
6518.04 Well, by the strict
definition of a pheromone,
6520.12 a molecule that's released
from one individual
6522.19 that impacts the biology
of another individual, yes.
6524.96 But in terms of identifying
what the pheromone is in tears,
6528.41 that's still unknown,
6529.72 it's not clear what the
chemical compound is.
6532.17 So, we're reluctant as scientists
6533.96 to call it a true pheromonal effect.
6535.58 The menstrual cycle
and the synchronization
6538.0 of the menstrual cycle
effect seems to hold up
6540.15 under some conditions.
6541.06 But in some cases,
6542.15 there's a kind of clash of
menstrual cycles that's created
6545.93 by chemicals that are emitted
6549.14 from one female to another.
6551.69 So, there are many
examples of this in humans,
6554.46 for instance, people can recognize
6558.15 the t-shirt of their mate.
6562.09 If you give...
6562.99 This experiment has been done many times,
6564.43 I know it's been challenged
a number of times,
6565.79 but the data are pretty good
by now that if you offer,
6569.6 you take a collection of women
6572.22 who are in stable
relationships with somebody,
6575.14 you offer them the smell of
a hundred different shirts
6577.73 and they can very readily pick out
6579.38 their significant others scent.
6581.35 Okay, that's pure olfaction,
that's not pheromonal,
6584.01 but nonetheless is a remarkable
degree of discrimination,
6587.33 olfactory discrimination.
6589.4 You can dilute their partner's scent
6593.16 down to the point where they themselves
6595.27 can't consciously detect the difference
6597.21 between the sweat or the t-shirt
6599.25 of a hundred different t-shirts or so,
6601.3 they might say, "I don't
really smell the difference,
6603.0 but I think it's this one.
6604.69 Yeah, this one belongs to the
person that I've been with."
6607.51 And they are much greater than chance
6609.16 at detecting the t-shirt
6610.86 or identifying the t-shirt correctly.
6612.95 So, there's no question really
6614.5 that there is chemical-chemical
signaling between humans,
6617.86 the question is whether or not
6619.04 it's truly pheromonal in basis.
6621.24 Now, you'll notice that a
lot of the examples I gave
6623.51 aside from the one of tears
is women detecting the scents
6628.58 of men or of other women.
6631.2 And it turns out that there
are a number of papers,
6634.83 the best one I think
6635.81 that I could find is published
in Physiology and Behavior
6639.12 in 2009, it's a review
6640.49 entitled Sex Differences and
Reproductive Hormone Influences
6643.82 on Human Odor Perception
6645.75 by Doty, D-O-T-Y, and Cameron.
6648.65 I encourage you to check out this review
6650.07 it's available free as a download,
6651.64 we'll provide a link to it,
6653.15 you can get the full PDF if you want.
6655.12 But it does seem that women
are better at detecting
6660.25 odors in these odor
discrimination tasks than are men.
6663.86 And yes, that it does vary
6665.37 according to where they are
in their menstrual cycle.
6668.76 And yes, they also looked at people
6670.89 who had received gonadectomy,
6672.033 they had their ovaries removed,
6673.75 a number of different important controls.
6676.21 None of this surprises me,
6677.95 none of this should surprise you,
6679.47 it's very clear that hormones
have a profound effect
6682.26 on enlarge number of systems
6683.88 in our biology and that smell, and taste,
6686.7 and the ability to sense the
chemical states of others,
6689.63 either consciously or subconsciously
6691.25 have a profound influence
6692.57 on whether or not we might
want to spend time with them,
6694.53 whether or not this is somebody
6695.5 that we're pair bonded with,
6696.9 whether or not this is somebody
6698.27 that we just met and don't
trust yet, things of this sort.
6702.46 And given what's at stake in
terms of reproductive biology,
6706.24 not just offspring, but
given the possibility
6709.73 of transmission of diseases, et cetera,
6712.81 you know, the risks of
childbirth, et cetera.
6717.29 It makes so much sense
that much of our biology
6720.53 is wired toward detecting
and sensing whether or not
6723.41 things and people are things
that we should approach
6726.41 or avoid, whether or not reproduction
6729.56 with that person is the
appropriate response
6731.51 or suppression of the
reproductive response
6733.75 is the appropriate response, right?
6735.45 As in that's the case with the tears.
6737.47 So, I think these are fascinating studies,
6740.02 it's an area that still
needs a lot of work,
6742.94 but there are some really
wonderful papers on this.
6745.407 And the one that I
mentioned a few minutes ago,
6747.23 Sex Differences and
Reproductive Hormone Influences
6749.3 on Human Odor Perception
6750.95 is one of the better
reviews that are out there.
6754.73 There are also a number of other reviews
6757.07 for instance that talk
about pheromone effects
6759.53 and their impact on mood,
and sexual responses,
6763.1 and things of that sort,
6763.933 and we will also provide
some links to those.
6765.49 A lot of this is still speculative,
6766.98 but I want to say I know
I said it three times,
6768.463 what I really want to underscore
6770.21 because it is vitally important,
6771.53 and people seem to get a little triggered
6772.99 by the notion of pheromones.
6776.17 Just because we haven't identified
6778.83 the actual chemical compound
6780.93 that's acting as a pheromone
or putative pheromone
6785.24 does not mean that
chemical-chemical signaling
6787.54 between individuals doesn't
exist, clearly it does.
6790.89 Actually, you and every other human
6793.79 from the time you're born
until the time you die
6795.87 are actively seeking out
6798.84 and sensing and evaluating
6802.15 the chemicals that come
from other individuals.
6804.463 There's a really nice study that was done
6807.61 by the Weizmann Institute, a group there,
6809.76 I think it was also Noam Sobel's group,
6811.29 but another group as well as I recall
6813.25 looking at human-human interactions
6815.51 when they meet for the first time.
6817.51 It's a remarkable study
because what they found
6820.98 was people would reach
out and shake hands.
6824.42 It's is a typical response,
6825.7 you know pre-pandemic, people would meet,
6828.12 they'd reach out and
they would shake hands.
6830.22 And what they observed
was almost every time
6834.32 within just a few seconds
of having shaken hands
6838.05 with this new individual,
6839.46 people will touch their
eyes almost without fail.
6843.08 Occasionally, they would
touch their eyebrow,
6844.64 occasionally someone
would touch their hair.
6846.41 We always associate that with
people having some sort of...
6849.8 Or us having some sort of
self-conscious response
6852.3 like oh, we want to make
sure shirt tucked in
6854.517 and all prim and proper, whatever it is,
6856.57 or looking right, is there
something you're like teeth?
6858.44 This kind of thing,
6859.44 but actually people are doing that
6861.26 even if the person they
just met left the room.
6864.64 So, someone's sitting there,
6865.64 someone comes in, they shake hands,
6867.62 and the person inevitably
subconsciously touches their eyes.
6871.09 They are taking chemicals
from the skin contact
6874.21 and they are placing it on a
mucosal membrane of some sort,
6877.3 typically not up to their
nose or in their mouth,
6879.4 typically on their eyes.
6880.87 Now, animals do this all the time,
6882.27 there's a phenomenon in
animals called bunting.
6884.63 If you have a overeager dog
6887.02 that when you meet them
or you see them again
6889.33 after you've been away for the day
6890.44 they'll rub their head against you, right?
6892.61 Cats will do this too,
it's called bunting,
6894.61 they're rubbing their scent glands on you,
6896.32 they're marking you.
6897.78 And believe it or not,
6898.79 you're marking other people
when you shake their hand,
6901.39 and they are then taking your mark
6903.88 and rubbing it on
themselves subconsciously.
6907.18 So, we all do these kinds of behaviors,
6908.97 and now that you're aware of it
6910.14 you can watch for it in your environment,
6911.85 you can pay attention to people.
6913.92 Some of this has probably changed
6915.18 in light of the events of 2020, et cetera,
6917.5 but nonetheless, we are evaluating
6920.52 the molecules on people's breath,
6922.65 we are evaluating the
molecules on people's skin
6925.15 by actively rubbing it on ourselves.
6928.56 And we are actively involved
6930.49 in sensing not just
their facial expressions,
6932.79 the size of their pupils,
and things like that,
6934.83 but the chemicals that they are emitting,
6936.78 their hormone status, how they smell.
6939.06 We're detecting the pheromones possibly,
6943.52 but certainly the odors in their breath.
6945.74 You might say, "Well, I
don't actually go around
6947.3 sniffing people's breath.
6948.53 I don't, you know, unless if it's bad,"
6950.24 in which case it's aversive,
6951.27 but breath is communicating
a lot of signals.
6953.61 And this handshake eye rub experiment
6956.35 shows that we are actively
going through behaviors
6959.62 reflexively to wipe ourselves
6962.14 or smear ourselves with
other people's chemicals.
6964.74 Now, that might seem odd
or even gross to you,
6967.58 but I think it's beautiful,
6969.47 I think that it illustrates
6971.09 the extent to which we as human beings
6973.09 are in some ways among the other animals
6975.84 in our subconscious, sometimes conscious,
6978.18 but certainly subconscious
6980.12 tendency to try and evaluate
our chemical environment
6983.02 through what we inhale through our nose,
6985.2 what we ingest through our mouth,
6987.45 and what we actively take
off other people's skin
6991.49 and rub on ourselves to evaluate it
6994.52 and what we should do about it,
6995.96 and perhaps that person as well.
6998.17 So today, we talked a
lot about olfaction taste
7001.0 and chemical sensing between individuals.
7003.36 I'd like to think that you now know a lot
7005.43 about how your smell system works
7007.37 and why inhaling is a really
good thing to do in general
7011.49 for waking up your brain,
and for cognitive function,
7014.06 and for enhancing your sense of smell.
7015.91 We talked about how to
enhance your sense of taste,
7018.31 and we talked about chemical signaling
7020.14 between individuals as
a way of communicating
7022.5 some important aspects about biology.
7024.82 People are shaping each
other's biology all the time
7027.41 by way of these chemicals
that are being traded
7029.47 from one body to the next
7031.06 through air, and skin to
skin contact, and tears.

7077.41 I do read all the comments on YouTube,

7083.58 We have a website hubermanlab.com
7085.84 where all the podcasts are housed
7088.34 with links to YouTube, Apple, and Spotify
7090.69 as well as downloadable links,
7092.4 everything's zero cost of course.
7094.37 And there, you can also find any links
7096.23 to additional resources
that we might post.
7099.39 As well, please check out our sponsors
7101.36 that we mentioned at the
beginning of each podcast episode,
7103.86 those sponsors are the way
7105.06 that we are able to bring zero
cost to consumer information
7108.26 about all these topics to you each week.
7110.48 And we also have a Patreon,
it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,
7115.52 and there you can support us
7117.15 at any level that you like.
7119.03 Today, we didn't really
talk about supplements,
7120.75 but previous episodes
and in future episodes
7123.14 we'll talk about supplements
and things that you can take
7125.08 to modify your biology and
nervous system if you like.
7128.2 We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
7130.81 because Thorne has the
highest levels of stringency
7133.09 with respect to the amounts
7134.54 of given compounds that
are in their supplements,
7136.71 and the quality and
purity of those compounds.
7139.41 If you go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman,
7145.1 you can see all the
supplements that I take
7147.52 and get 20% off any of those supplements
7149.89 as well as any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes,
7153.03 you just go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
7156.03 And if you enter their
website through that portal
7158.23 you get 20% off any of
their things at checkout.
7161.17 Last but not least,
7162.16 I want to thank you for
your time and attention,
7164.18 and your willingness to
embrace new concepts and terms,
7167.0 and to learn about science and biology,
7169.01 and protocols that
hopefully can benefit you
7171.097 and the people that you know,
7172.7 and of course thank you for
your interest in science.
