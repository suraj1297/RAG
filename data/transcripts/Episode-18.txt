0.36 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast
2.28 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
6.123 [MUSIC PLAYING]
9.09 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.08 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.08 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.94 Today, we are discussing meditation.
17.34 We are going to discuss
the science of meditation,
19.74 that is, what happens
in the brain and body
21.84 while we are meditating,
23.52 and we will talk about
the science of meditation
25.56 as it relates to how the
brain and body change
28.08 as a consequence of meditation,
29.85 that is, what you export or
take from a meditation practice
33.45 that can impact everything
from your sleep to your mood.
36.72 For instance, meditation has been shown
38.49 to alleviate symptoms of depression.
40.98 And we will also talk about how meditation
42.9 can be used to enhance focus
and other states of mind
46.02 that are useful for work
and other aspects of life.
49.02 Now, of course, most of you
49.86 have probably heard of meditation,
51.15 and when we think of meditation,
52.74 most often, we think of somebody
54.36 either sitting or lying down.
55.98 If they're sitting, we might imagine them
57.63 in the so-called lotus position,
58.92 you know, sitting with
legs crossed, very upright,
60.81 with hands on the knees or,
you know, crossed in our lap
63.57 or something of that sort.
64.95 Typically, we think of somebody
who is in a very calm state,
67.62 eyes closed, focused on their
so-called third eye center.
71.13 The third eye center is the
area just behind one's forehead.
74.19 There's no third eye there,
at least there shouldn't be,
78.0 but I'll tell you why it's
called the third eye center
80.82 and what the origins of that are
82.14 and why it's relevant, actually,
for a meditative practice.
85.2 With all that said, it
turns out that meditation
87.24 encompasses a huge variety
of different practices.
90.39 Some of those practices
indeed are done sitting
92.49 or lying down with one's eyes closed,
94.29 focusing on the third eye center.
95.94 Other of those practices
are focused on a body scan,
99.15 you know, really focusing
on one area of the body
101.4 and its contact with whatever surface
103.2 you happen to be sitting or lying on
105.03 or can be done walking.
107.04 In fact, there are walking
meditations done with eyes open.
110.25 So there are many different
forms of meditation,
112.11 but today, we are going to focus
113.28 mainly on how specific types of meditation
115.74 and specific areas of the brain
117.84 that are activated
during those meditations
120.12 change our way of being
in fundamental ways,
122.91 not just during the meditation practice,
124.89 but afterwards as well.
126.93 So if you're somebody who's interested
128.49 in changing your default
state of mood or of thinking
132.0 or enhancing your ability to focus
133.74 or improving your sleep
or improving performance
136.59 in some cognitive or physical endeavor,
138.78 meditation is powerful,
140.19 but you want to make sure
141.12 that you pick the right
meditation practice.
143.55 So we will talk about
picking a meditation practice
146.46 that isn't just feasible
because you'll do it
148.65 but is actually directed at
the goals specific to you
152.43 and what you need most.
153.81 So to give you some sense of
the contour of today's episode,
156.51 first, I'm going to talk about
157.343 some of the underlying biology,
159.06 the mechanisms and the brain areas
161.64 and also the areas of the
body that are activated
165.3 during certain forms of meditation,
166.92 and, equally important,
167.76 which areas of the brain and body
168.93 are shut down or reduced in their activity
171.09 during specific types of meditation.
173.34 Then I'll transition
174.45 into how to best do a meditation practice,
177.12 how to get the most out of
that meditation practice,
179.79 and then I will talk about how to change
181.83 or alter your meditation practices
183.84 according to your specific goals
185.43 and as you get better at meditation.
187.53 And this can get a little
bit counterintuitive,
189.21 but in a positive way.
190.56 What I mean by that is, for
instance, a lot of people think
192.99 that as you meditate and
get better at meditating,
195.3 you need to meditate
more and more and more,
197.61 sort of like if you get better
at running endurance races
200.07 that you need to keep
running longer and longer,
201.78 you know, first a 5K, then a 10K,
203.76 then a marathon, then ultras.
205.53 With meditation, it's
actually quite the opposite.
207.69 The better that you get
209.22 at dropping into a particular brain state
212.22 and the more your so-called
traits of brain state shift,
215.7 not just states as they're
sometimes referred to,
217.86 but traits, this is a
theme that I've picked up
219.75 from a terrific book
that I'll refer to later,
222.9 but the more that you can get
224.16 into specific neural circuits quickly,
227.43 actually, the less you need to meditate
230.28 in order to derive the
benefits of meditation.
233.1 So that's a wonderful aspect
of meditative practices
235.5 that's unlike a lot of other
forms of mental exercise
239.28 and cognitive enhancing exercises.
241.32 So we'll talk about all of that today,
242.88 and I promise that by the
end of today's episode,
245.19 you will have a rich array
of meditative practices
247.56 to select from,
248.393 you'll know why each of them work
249.93 and why they can be directed
toward particular goals
252.33 and how to do that,
253.59 and you'll also know
254.423 how to modify those meditation practices
256.98 under conditions where
you might get busier
258.84 or where you're suffering
from lack of sleep,
260.607 and I think a lot of people
will be excited to know
262.47 that today we're going to discuss
263.91 a specific form of meditation
265.41 that can indeed reduce your need for sleep
268.29 and still allow you to
enhance your cognitive
270.99 and physical abilities.
272.37 Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast
274.98 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
277.77 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
279.96 to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information
281.88 about science and science-related tools
283.92 to the general public.
285.15 In keeping with that theme,
286.29 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
289.02 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
291.359 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
293.7 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
296.31 to help you better understand your body
297.99 and help you meet your health goals.
299.52 Now, I've long been a believer
300.54 in getting regular blood work done
302.22 for the simple reason
that many of the factors
304.47 that impact your immediate
and long-term health
306.57 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
309.03 One issue with a lot of blood tests
310.53 and DNA tests out there, however,
311.94 is that you get information back
313.29 about hormones, blood lipids, et cetera,
315.54 but you don't know what to
do with that information.
317.28 InsideTracker makes understanding
all of that very easy
319.86 and, even better, points
to specific directives,
322.68 that is, things you can do
in terms of your lifestyle,
324.87 your nutrition,
supplementation, et cetera,
327.03 in order to bring those numbers
328.5 related to metabolic factors,
lipids, hormones, et cetera,
331.35 into the ranges that are optimal for you,
333.6 your immediate and long-term health.
335.64 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

346.38 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Thesis.
349.02 Thesis makes custom nootropics,
350.85 and to be honest, I am not a
fan of the word nootropics.
353.67 I've said this many times before
354.81 on this podcast and other podcasts,
356.61 and the reason I don't
like the word nootropics
358.5 is that it means smart drugs.
360.75 And as a neuroscientist,
362.49 I'm aware that there are neural circuits,
364.2 that is, connections in the brain and body
366.27 that underlie things like focus
367.95 or our ability to switch tasks
or creativity, et cetera.
372.0 There is no neural
circuit for being smart.
374.64 And so Thesis understands this,
376.59 and as a consequence, they've
developed custom nootropics
379.02 that are designed to
bring your brain and body
380.97 into specific states to become,
for instance, more focused
384.45 or to engage in creative work
386.25 or to have more energy for
workouts and things of that sort.
389.52 At Thesis, you can go there,
you take a brief quiz,
392.04 and they will design a kit
393.6 of four different custom
nootropics that you can try
395.88 and then modify along with their help
397.83 so that you can develop a
kit of custom nootropics
400.17 that are perfect for your needs.
402.24 Perhaps one for creativity,
another one for motivation,
404.67 another one for focus, and
another one for energy.
406.98 They'll build those for you.
408.42 To get your own personalized
nootropics starter kit,
410.37 you can go online to

419.43 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
421.89 ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
423.81 that are of the absolute highest quality.
425.97 The company was founded
426.803 by two all-American
swimmers from Stanford,
428.76 and everything about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses
431.1 were designed with performance in mind.
433.35 Now, I spent a lifetime
working on the visual system,
435.21 and I can tell you that your visual system
436.47 has to contend with an
enormous number of challenges
439.02 in order for you to be
able to see clearly.
440.82 ROKA understands this
441.81 and has designed their
sunglasses and eyeglasses
443.94 to be worn in any number
of different conditions
446.13 and for you to still be able
to see with crystal clarity
448.95 They were designed for things
like cycling and running
451.29 so they won't slip off your
face if they get sweaty,
453.15 they're extremely lightweight.
454.2 In fact, most of the time,
455.07 I can't even remember
that they're on my face,
456.48 they're so lightweight.
457.313 However, they also can be worn anywhere,
459.33 to work, to dinner, et cetera.
460.8 They have a terrific aesthetic,
461.91 unlike a lot of other
performance eyeglasses out there
463.743 that you can only find in designs
465.57 that really make people
look like a cyborg.
467.25 ROKA makes the cyborg versions,
some people like those,
469.47 but they also make versions
471.21 of their eyeglasses and
sunglasses with frames
473.37 that you can wear out to
dinner, to work, et cetera.
476.04 If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses,
478.2 go to roka.com, that's roka.com,
480.93 and enter the code Huberman
482.43 to save 20% off your first order.
484.41 Again, that's ROKA, roka.com

488.58 The Huberman Lab podcast
489.69 is now partnered with
Momentous supplements.
491.52 To find the supplements we discuss
492.87 on the Huberman Lab podcast,
494.07 you can go to livemomentous,
spelled O-U-S,
497.01 livemomentous.com/huberman.
498.957 And I should just mention that the library
500.67 of those supplements is
constantly expanding.
502.86 Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
505.95 Let's talk about meditation.
507.33 As I mentioned earlier,
508.59 we are going to talk about what
areas of the brain and body
511.26 are active during meditation
and after meditation
514.17 and why that can be so beneficial.
516.24 We will also talk about when
and how best to meditate.
519.153 Now, this is a topic I've
long been interested in.
521.94 I was first given a book on meditation
523.71 when I was in high school
525.18 because, to make a long story short,
527.16 I was a bit of a wild one
early in my high school years,
530.13 and as a consequence of
a program that I was in,
533.85 somebody handed me a book on meditation.
536.37 That book is still available now.
538.32 That book is called "Wherever
You Go, There you Are"
540.78 by Jon Kabat-Zinn.
542.43 He was one of the first, not the only,
544.32 but one of the first people
545.7 to really start popularizing meditation
547.407 and mindfulness practices
in the United States.
550.68 So this was in the late 1980s,
553.35 and it was really only until recently
556.02 that there were very few
studies of meditation,
558.6 although those really
picked up in the '90s.
560.94 Now you can find many,
many thousands of studies
564.54 on meditation and their mechanistic basis,
566.46 so brain imaging studies,
changes in hormones in the body.
569.4 But in the late 1980s
and in the early 1990s,
572.76 because functional imaging of the brain,
574.74 so-called MRI or fMRI, was
really just starting to emerge
578.82 as a popular tool in
laboratories and hospitals,
581.67 there really wasn't that much
mechanistic understanding
583.77 about how meditation worked,
585.24 but, of course, there
was a deep understanding
587.58 from cultures outside the United States
590.19 that meditation was extremely useful.
592.62 I should just mention,
593.49 as long as we're talking about
the history of meditation,
596.01 any discussion about meditation
598.11 is going to be a discussion
about states of mind,
600.78 and any discussion about states of mind
602.79 invokes the word consciousness,
604.26 a kind of a dangerous topic
to get into in any format
607.92 because a lot of people
talk about consciousness,
611.01 but people use consciousness, the word,
614.07 to mean different things.
615.18 It doesn't have one standard
operational definition
617.7 as scientists call it.
619.47 However, discussions about consciousness
622.17 are often part and
parcel with conversations
625.08 about things like psychedelics
627.0 and kind of alternative therapies.
628.89 And so in the 1960s and
especially in the 1970s,
632.01 meditation and psychedelics
were actually close cousins
635.91 in the conversation about
consciousness and states of mind.
639.21 That conversation started to split
641.94 into two different divisions,
643.53 and I'll explain why in a moment.
645.6 It gets to a little bit of
interesting academic sociology.
648.57 But what happened was
there were a couple of guys
650.58 at Harvard, including
Timothy Leary and others,
654.21 who got really interested in psychedelics,
656.58 in particular LSD,
lysergic acid diethylamide.
660.18 And at that time,
661.41 that was part of the whole
counterculture movement,
663.36 it was considered very anti-establishment,
665.4 and they were really
encouraging students at Harvard
668.58 to take LSD.
670.62 They were also very
interested in meditation.
672.81 But what ended up happening
673.89 is they essentially got kicked
out or fired from Harvard,
676.92 and there's a book that I'll refer you to
678.63 in the show note captions
679.71 if you're interested in
learning more about all this.
681.33 But they got kicked out and fired
682.71 for their emphasis on psychedelics.
684.78 Now, nowadays, there's a lot
of interest in psychedelics.
687.72 We've had episodes with
Dr. Matthew Johnson
690.06 from Johns Hopkins University
who's running clinical trials
692.67 on psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD
694.65 for the treatment of depression and PTSD.
697.05 We've also had Dr. Nolan
Williams on the podcast,
699.72 my colleague at Stanford
who's doing incredible studies
702.48 on some of those compounds as well.
704.1 So nowadays, the conversation
about psychedelics
706.02 is coming back,
707.07 and it's somewhat divorced
708.66 from the conversation about meditation,
710.73 but in the 1960s and 1970s,
713.49 the conversation about
psychedelics and meditation
715.89 was sort of one and the same.
718.62 That changed in the late
1980s and early 1990s
722.79 when people like Jon Kabat-Zinn
724.35 started writing books that
were purely about meditation
727.26 and suggesting that people
explore meditative practices
730.05 for the utility to bring calmness,
731.85 adjust stress, improve sleep, et cetera,
734.91 divorced from the conversation
about psychedelics.
737.49 Now, that's not to say that
the scientific community
739.65 immediately embraced the
conversation about meditation.
742.32 In fact, it took quite a long while
744.72 for schools like Harvard and Stanford
747.18 and other universities around the world
748.8 to start embracing and
funding studies of meditation,
753.06 asking what sorts of
brain areas are involved,
755.1 how it changes the body,
756.36 and, perhaps most importantly,
757.98 how a meditation practice
can shift the brain and body
760.59 when somebody is finished meditating
762.63 and is off in their life
doing their everyday things.
765.75 In the late 1980s and
especially within the 1990s,
769.74 the advent of brain imaging technology
771.48 like magnetic residence imaging, MRI,
774.24 or functional magnetic residence imaging
776.1 was a way to look at the
brain while it was active,
779.61 not just to get an image of its structure,
781.44 but also how it's functioning
782.73 in the areas that so-called light up.
784.53 When all of that technology
became accessible and popular,
787.62 well, that allowed a large
number of laboratories
789.78 to start asking how specific patterns
792.54 of thinking and breathing,
794.04 maybe people sitting
in the lotus position,
795.75 but more often than that,
796.68 it would be people inside of an MRI magnet
799.08 because it is a magnet,
799.95 they sort of put you into a little tube
801.18 and push you into the tube, not
against your will of course,
804.54 but put people into the
tube, have them meditate,
807.18 and then look at how the brain changed
809.07 and to do that over time.
810.6 When those studies were done,
812.1 what was discovered was really
quite miraculous, really.
815.7 And now we don't think
of it as surprising,
817.68 but what was discovered
818.94 was a huge laundry list of brain changes.
821.79 And then when people were
evaluated in their outside life,
825.27 so when they would fill out reports
827.13 of their subjective feelings of happiness
828.81 or they would report their sleep,
830.07 or even if objective measures were taken
832.41 like changes in hormones
833.76 or markers of inflammation, et cetera,
836.28 a large list of information
fell out of that
840.27 which revealed that indeed there are many,
843.06 a dozen or more clear benefits
845.76 of a regular meditation practice,
847.65 and some of those meditation
practices could be quite short.
850.95 So nowadays, we think of meditation
852.8 as pretty commonly accepted,
854.22 and in fact, that has a
lot to do with the fact
856.83 that many of the major tech companies
859.05 in the Bay Area during the
2000s such as Google and Apple
863.22 and any number of different
social media companies
865.68 and other companies and
business ventures, et cetera,
868.17 and investment firms all over the world
870.6 started hiring people to train meditation
873.09 or had online courses for meditation.
875.58 So nowadays, we think of
meditation as this thing
877.86 that almost everybody
understands can benefit us,
881.22 but we now sit at an interesting frontier
884.28 where most people think of
meditation as one thing,
887.55 sort of like the word exercise,
888.81 which, of course, could
mean weight training,
890.37 it could mean running,
891.203 it could mean high-intensity
interval training,
893.43 all of which, as you know,
will get you different results
896.94 depending on what you
do, how often you do it,
899.07 and the specifics of what you actually do.
901.77 So, too, meditation can give
you very specific results.
905.55 It can give you more focus,
it can give you better sleep,
908.45 it can give you a combination of results
910.14 just like exercise can
depending on the exercise.
913.05 So what we are going to talk about next
914.61 is the specific changes
that happen in the brain
917.4 with specific aspects of meditation.
919.68 That is, what happens
when you close your eyes,
922.2 what happens when you
focus your attention inward
924.93 versus focusing your attention outward
926.58 because, as I mentioned before,
927.99 there's third eye meditation
where you close your eyes
929.85 and focus on that spot
just behind your forehead
932.13 and you focus on your breathing.
933.6 There's also meditation practices
935.13 where you're focusing
on what you're eating
936.63 with a lot of so-called mindfulness,
938.28 being very present to
whatever's happening,
940.17 not letting your mind wander
941.61 or think about yesterday or tomorrow
943.83 or what's happening next,
944.88 but really focusing on the present.
947.25 There are also meditation
practices, of course,
949.44 where you are in a format of
interpersonal communication
952.77 where you're really
listening very intensely.
954.84 That, too, is a form of mindfulness.
956.64 So we're going to parse
each of these things,
958.32 and we are going to ask
959.46 what's happening in the brain and body
960.9 during each of these meditation practices
963.0 so that you can develop
specific meditation practices
965.91 that you can invoke in your
real life on a daily basis
969.3 or, thankfully, I would say,
for some who are pretty busy,
973.14 that you could even do once
a week or even once a month
975.93 that will still clearly
benefit you in specific ways.
979.38 I'd like to spend the
next 10 minutes or so
981.51 talking about the
neuroscience of meditation,
983.817 and I promise you I'm not
going to just list off
986.04 a bunch of different brain areas
987.27 that are active during meditation.
988.71 That wouldn't be useful to you.
989.76 In fact, I don't believe
991.11 in throwing out a lot of nomenclature
992.91 without also giving some
mechanistic explanation
995.88 as to what different brain areas do.
997.857 And you could say, "Well,
what good is it knowing
999.99 what different brain
areas do and their names
1001.82 if I can't actually
manipulate those brain areas?"
1003.98 But the good news
1004.813 is you actually can
manipulate those brain areas.
1007.37 As I'll tell you today,
1008.24 you can turn up the activity
in certain brain areas
1011.33 and turn down the activity
in specific brain areas
1014.06 with specific elements
of a meditation practice,
1016.88 so that's quite exciting
and quite different really
1019.31 from other aspects of neuroscience
1020.96 that we might discuss on this podcast.
1023.15 So there are a few different brain areas
1025.13 whose names I'd like to arm you with.
1027.23 And again, the names
themselves aren't essential,
1030.26 but if you can grasp even the top contour
1032.3 of what I'm about to say,
1033.26 you'll be in a much better position
1034.58 to parse and use the
information that follows.
1038.18 There's an area of your brain
1039.41 that sits right behind your forehead
1041.3 that's called the prefrontal cortex.
1043.28 Basically, it's the
front bumper of your head
1045.65 just behind the bone, okay?
1047.69 That area just behind your forehead
1049.01 that we call the prefrontal cortex
1050.72 actually encompasses a
lot of different things.
1052.91 And actually, you have two of them.
1054.8 You have one on the
right side of your brain
1056.48 and you have one on the
left side of your brain,
1058.28 and they're connected to one another
1059.51 but they actually do different things.
1061.43 The area that I'd like to
focus on today for a bit
1064.1 is the so-called left prefrontal cortex,
1066.98 or if we were going to
get really specific,
1068.84 we'd say the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex.
1071.69 Dorsal means up, lateral
means to the side,
1074.45 so if you want to touch
the left side of your head
1076.52 and move your hand just
toward the midline,
1078.86 toward the sort of top of
your head a little bit,
1081.05 so that's dorsal, and then lateral,
1083.06 as long as your hand is still
on the side of your head,
1084.62 you're in the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, okay?
1087.65 So you've got your hand
probably right over
1089.66 your left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
1092.54 That area of the brain, we
know from lesion studies
1095.3 where it's been damaged
in animals or humans
1097.67 and we know from stimulation studies
1099.92 where it's been selectively
stimulated in animals,
1103.13 or yes, indeed, also
it's been done in humans,
1106.82 has an incredible ability to
control your bodily senses
1111.47 and to make sense, that is,
to interpret what's going on
1115.34 in terms of your emotions
and your bodily sensations.
1118.49 So from now on, unless I say otherwise,
1120.83 if I say prefrontal cortex,
I'm specifically referring
1123.74 to the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex,
1125.99 but I'm going to shorten that up
1127.13 just for sake of simplicity
and ease of communication.
1129.98 If I'm going to talk about
another area of prefrontal cortex,
1132.08 I'll talk about another area,
1133.19 but if I say prefrontal cortex today,
1134.99 what I mean is left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
1137.96 Stimulation of left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
1140.78 or, I should say more appropriately,
1142.52 when your left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex is active,
1147.53 you are in a great position
1149.99 to interpret what's going
on with you emotionally,
1153.26 to interpret your bodily signals
of comfort or discomfort,
1157.58 and then to make really good decisions
1159.38 on the basis of that interpretation.
1162.32 And that's because the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
1166.01 is in direct communication with
1167.96 and is directly connected
to another brain area
1171.65 called the anterior
cingulate cortex, or ACC.
1175.04 Now, I'm just going to refer
to it as the ACC, okay?
1178.52 The ACC is an area of your brain
1181.34 that is interpreting a
lot of different things
1183.35 about bodily signals,
1184.73 for instance, how fast you're breathing,
1188.3 whether or not your heart is
beating quickly or slowly,
1191.9 and, more importantly,
1193.04 whether or not your heart
is beating quickly or slowly
1195.53 for the circumstance that you are in.
1197.66 So for instance, if
you're running up a hill
1199.52 and you're even in great shape
1202.04 and your heart is beating very fast,
1204.08 it's unlikely that you
are going to be concerned
1206.87 about your heart beating fast
1208.55 because that is appropriate
for the circumstance.
1210.8 However, if you're just walking along
1212.69 and all of a sudden, your heart
starts beating very quickly
1214.52 for no apparent reason,
1217.52 well, then you are going to interpret that
1219.5 as either pathologic or uncomfortable,
1223.1 inappropriate for the context
that you happen to be in.
1227.63 The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
1230.09 is the area of the brain
1231.08 that actually has some control over
1233.48 and especially can interpret
1235.49 what's going on in this ACC region.
1238.7 Now, most of you probably
haven't heard of the ACC.
1241.19 Most of you probably have
heard of a brain area
1243.5 called the amygdala.
1244.34 It's an almond-shaped structure
1245.75 on the two sides of the brain,
1246.8 people talk about it as
the fear center, et cetera.
1249.14 But your ACC, the
anterior cingulate cortex,
1252.23 gets input from areas like the amygdala,
1254.24 your threat detection centers,
1255.38 but it also gets input
from an enormous number
1258.65 of other areas of your brain and body,
1260.51 including your heart, your gut,
1263.9 so it gets information about how full,
1266.75 that is, distended, or
how empty your gut is.
1269.69 It gets information about
how quickly you're breathing
1271.97 from input from your lungs
and related structures.
1276.47 It's an absolutely critical station
1278.99 for making sense of what's
going on in your body,
1281.24 and it works very closely
along with one other structure.
1284.087 And I promise this is going
to be the third structure
1286.52 in this triad, and then
I'll stop listing off names.
1288.98 So we have dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
1290.51 Think of that as sort of the interpreter
1291.98 of what's going on inside of you.
1293.9 You have the ACC, or
anterior cingulate cortex,
1296.9 which is the area of your brain
1298.1 that's bringing in all this information
1300.11 about what's going on inside your body
1302.27 and even on the surface of your body.
1303.98 You know, if you have any pain or an itch
1305.69 or a mosquito bite on
the surface of your body,
1307.31 your ACC would definitely register that.
1309.912 And then there's this other
1310.79 absolutely incredible brain structure
1312.44 which is called the insula,
I-N-S-U-L-A, insula,
1315.8 and the insula has a bunch
of different parts to it.
1318.14 But the insula is another area
that is interpreting signals
1322.4 of what's going on in your brain and body,
1325.22 so the ACC and the insula
are working together
1327.35 to try and figure out, you
know, what's going on inside me?
1330.29 And in addition to that,
1331.7 the insula is interpreting information
1333.77 about what's going on outside of you.
1336.29 So your insula is saying, for instance,
1338.603 hey, this is a steep
hill that I'm running up,
1340.94 and as a consequence,
1342.29 whatever heart rate increase
that I'm experiencing
1344.81 or heavy breathing or burning in my lungs,
1346.73 this all makes sense.
1347.9 I don't have to be worried,
I don't have to be scared.
1349.64 I might want to slow down,
but this makes sense.
1352.13 Whereas, for instance, in the
example I previously gave,
1354.86 where if you're sitting in a room
1356.48 and everything is pretty calm,
1358.13 and all of a sudden, you start
feeling really uncomfortable,
1360.65 like your stomach doesn't feel right
1362.0 or you start breathing quickly
1363.13 or you start having a so-called
anxiety or panic attack,
1366.38 in large part, that's because the shift
1368.84 in your bodily sensations doesn't match
1371.39 or doesn't correspond to
something in the outside world.
1374.27 So there's this incredible triad
1375.95 which includes the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
1378.8 the cingulate or anterior
cingulate cortex, and the insula,
1381.95 and those three are working together
1383.96 in a kind of conversation,
1385.22 it's a neural conversation,
but a conversation nonetheless,
1388.13 trying to figure out, okay,
what's going on inside me?
1390.74 How do I feel? What am I thinking about?
1393.17 And this could be thoughts about the past
1394.64 or the future or the present.
1397.07 They are also in a conversation
1399.17 as to whether or not the sensations
1401.18 that you're experiencing,
1402.71 meaning how quick your breathing is
1404.39 or how slow your breathing is,
1405.92 how your heart feels, how your skin feels,
1409.04 any sensations of pain, or
pleasure for that matter,
1412.64 whether or not that makes sense
for the situation you're in
1415.04 and trying to determine
1416.03 whether or not you are
doing the right things
1418.67 as a consequence of those sensations.
1421.34 Okay, so again, if you
can't remember the names
1424.22 of these different neural
structures in the brain,
1425.99 don't worry about it.
1426.89 It's really not that critical.
1428.36 What is critical is that you understand
1430.64 that there's a conversation
that's constantly occurring
1433.97 as long as you are awake
1435.74 trying to figure out what's
going on inside of you
1439.1 and whether or not it makes sense
1440.42 relative to what's going
on outside and around you.
1443.57 Now, humans are smart.
1444.92 That is, we are, to some
extent, conscious of the fact
1448.82 that we have memories of the
past, awareness of the present,
1453.29 and anticipation of the future.
1455.39 So we do realize, for instance,
1457.34 that we can be seated at
the dinner table, excuse me,
1460.13 and have a thought about
something tomorrow,
1462.86 maybe an exam that's stressing us out
1464.96 or something like that,
1465.793 and that will change our bodily state
1467.99 in a way that is not optimal
1469.85 for what we're doing in the moment
1471.59 but that can still make sense to us
1473.09 because that exam is important,
1474.44 maybe we're feeling some pressure
1475.67 about a hard conversation we have to have,
1477.35 or maybe we are very
excited about the next day
1480.02 and we can't eat because we're so excited,
1482.48 and that can make perfect sense to us
1483.86 because we do have access
to this knowledge about self
1487.16 that we can think about the past,
1488.93 the present, or the future.
1490.61 So that makes the conversation
these three structures are in
1493.88 even more interesting and dynamic
1495.89 because what it means is that
we can be doing something,
1499.85 eating, talking, running,
1502.31 any number of different activities,
1504.44 and our bodily state may or
may not match what we are doing
1509.12 in a way that's adaptive for that,
1511.58 and yet that can be completely okay
1513.01 or at least understandable for us.
1516.47 Now, a major emphasis
of a meditation practice
1519.86 is to make us so-called more mindful.
1523.1 What is mindfulness?
1524.06 Well, again, there isn't one perfect
1525.68 universally accepted operational
definition of mindfulness.
1529.34 That's basically nerd speak
1530.48 for saying people can't agree
exactly what mindfulness
1533.93 should be, is, and means for everyone.
1538.1 But most people assume, and I think agree,
1540.62 that mindfulness includes
something about being present.
1544.88 And when I say present,
1545.93 that doesn't necessarily mean
present to one's surroundings
1548.66 because of course a lot
of meditation practices
1550.82 that are designed to make
us more mindful and present
1553.19 are designed to make us
more mindful and present
1554.84 to what's happening internally
1556.55 while ignoring everything
that's happening externally,
1559.97 but they are designed
to make us more present
1562.37 to our bodily sensations
1563.81 and, in particular, our
breathing and our thoughts
1566.69 in the moment.
1567.98 So let's now explore
1569.45 what a generic meditation
practice looks like,
1571.61 and let's evaluate how that
tends to change the activity
1575.09 of these neural circuits
in the brain and body.
1576.92 And then from there, we
can split the conversation
1579.5 into a couple of different bins,
1581.12 that is, meditation
practices that are ideal
1584.0 for enhancing focus,
1585.68 meditation practices that
are ideal for improving mood,
1588.89 meditation practices that are
ideal for improving sleep,
1592.52 and meditation practices
that, believe it or not,
1596.09 benefit all of those
things in one fell swoop.
1599.09 Okay, so what happens
during a meditation practice
1601.31 at the neural level?
1602.9 In order to answer that question,
1604.61 we are going to be scientists.
1605.96 That means you and I are
going to be scientists now.
1608.51 We are going to break down a practice
1610.49 into its different component parts
1613.04 and address what we know for sure
1616.16 about the brain activation
states that occur
1619.07 with those different component parts.
1620.75 In order to do that,
1621.583 let's use a somewhat
generic form of meditation,
1623.96 but it's generic and pretty far-reaching
1626.39 because I would say that for most people,
1629.54 about 75%, let's say,
1632.3 a meditation practice is
going to involve stopping,
1635.6 meaning getting out of
motion, sitting or lying down,
1641.51 and, in most cases, closing one's eyes,
1644.12 although it is absolutely not required
1647.03 to close one's eyes during meditation.
1648.68 There are many forms of meditation
that are done eyes open.
1652.28 But for most people,
1653.21 it's going to involve
stopping our movement,
1655.73 that is, not ambulating,
not walking or running,
1658.13 so seated or lying down with eyes closed.
1662.12 When we do that,
1662.96 meaning when we sit or lie
down and close our eyes,
1666.11 as trivial as that shift
might sound to you,
1668.84 it actually is a profound shift
in the way that your brain
1672.74 and other neural circuits
in your body function
1675.98 for the following reason.
1677.93 When we close our eyes,
1680.12 we shut down a major avenue of
what's called exteroception.
1685.4 What do I mean by exteroception?
1687.08 Well, very briefly, we are
sensing things on our body
1691.64 and in our body all the time.
1693.26 We are also sensing things from
outside of us all the time,
1695.93 so these could be sights or
sounds, touch on our body,
1698.93 sensations withinside our body, et cetera.
1701.48 Now, sensation is distinct
from what we call perception.
1705.05 Perception is, put simply,
1708.68 the sensations that we happen
to be paying attention to.
1712.1 So at any given moment, you
are sensing many, many things.
1715.01 There are sound waves hitting your ears,
1716.48 there are pressure receptors
on the bottoms of your feet
1718.88 sensing your shoes or your
sandals or the floor, et cetera,
1722.0 but you're not perceiving them
1723.44 until you place your attention on them.
1725.87 Now, the way perception works
1728.63 is that you have so-called
spotlights of attention.
1731.57 You can't perceive everything all at once,
1735.26 every sound, every sight, every touch.
1737.24 That would be overwhelming. In
fact, that would be terrible.
1739.67 Rather you have spotlights of perception
1742.55 that can either be very narrow,
1744.53 so for instance,
1745.363 you could focus all of
your perception right now
1747.62 on your big toe of your right foot
1749.72 and really pour all of your
awareness, your attention
1753.8 into what you're perceiving
there, what it feels like,
1756.38 if there's tingling or pressure,
heat or cold, et cetera,
1759.98 or you can broaden that
spotlight to include both feet
1763.07 or all your toes on both feet
1764.66 and then your legs and your
whole body or the entire room.
1767.9 Perception is like a spotlight,
1769.43 and I should mention
there are very good data
1771.77 that we can split our attention into two
1774.62 but probably not more than two spotlights,
1777.56 and we can make those
spotlights of perception
1780.47 either very broad and
diffuse or very narrow.
1783.5 You can practice this now if you like.
1785.03 You can pick a spot on the
wall away from you anywhere,
1788.63 or if you're driving, you
can look at some location,
1790.49 and you can focus intensely
on one small location,
1794.15 for instance, a tree in the horizon
1796.04 or a person on the street
1797.51 or any number of different
things outside of you,
1800.78 or you can broaden that spotlight
1802.34 to include the entire scene at once.
1804.35 You can also focus a spotlight
of perception on your body,
1807.74 say on the left upper
portion of your chest.
1812.15 And of course you can focus
1813.74 on the left upper portion of your chest
1815.51 and something outside of you,
1816.77 you can split your attention
1818.03 between those two perceptual spotlights.
1820.61 It's very hard, although not impossible,
1822.32 to have three perceptual spotlights,
1824.69 but most people can split to two points
1827.51 of attention or perception pretty easily.
1830.27 The other thing that most
people can do pretty easily
1832.7 is merge those two spotlights
1835.16 or, rather, to have just
one spotlight of attention.
1837.59 So you don't always have
1838.43 to have two spotlights of attention on,
1840.14 and here, I'm using the word attention
1841.4 and perception interchangeably.
1843.11 But you could, for instance,
have two points of attention,
1846.02 so you're talking to somebody
and you're paying attention
1847.64 to whether or not somebody's
walking in the door or not,
1850.01 so that's two,
1850.91 or you could be completely focused
1852.38 on the person you're talking to,
1853.46 or you could be completely
focused on the stomach ache
1855.77 or the great sensation of hunger
that you have in your belly
1858.62 while talking to somebody,
1859.67 in fact, you're not even listening
1860.93 to what they're saying at all.
1862.28 Okay? So you have two
spotlights of perception.
1864.47 You can split them or merge them into one.
1867.56 And, this is very important,
1869.51 those spotlights of perception
can intensify or dim,
1873.05 and there, I'm using analogy.
1874.73 What I mean by that is your
perception of what's happening
1877.7 within those spotlights can
be very, very high acuity.
1881.93 That is, you can register
very fine changes in detail
1885.11 like tingling on one side of
your big toe of your right foot
1888.41 versus the other,
1889.46 or it can be somewhat more diffuse.
1891.17 You're just thinking about your whole toe,
1892.67 which, in that case,
seems like a small area,
1894.5 but the point is that you can
consciously adjust the acuity,
1898.82 that is, the fineness of your perception.
1901.82 All of this is under your power
1903.62 because of the incredible
ability of a brain structure
1906.47 whose name you now understand and know,
1908.99 which is the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex,
1911.87 although there are other
areas of your brain
1913.46 involved as well.
1914.63 Your ability to direct your
attention to specific things
1918.17 in your environment or within your body
1920.51 or to split those points
of attention or merge them
1923.66 or dial up the intensity
1925.22 of how closely you're paying attention
1927.38 to every little shift or ripple
1929.6 and change in sensation there
1931.94 or to kind of dissociate, if you will,
1934.79 for lack of a better word,
1935.87 to disengage from that perception,
1938.18 all of that is under control
because of your ability
1940.91 to engage this area that we
call the prefrontal cortex,
1944.0 and, in particular, the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
1947.48 I'd like to take a quick break
1948.86 and acknowledge one of our
sponsors, Athletic Greens.
1951.89 Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
1954.38 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
1956.72 that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.
1959.63 I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,
1962.33 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
1964.55 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens
1966.14 and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens
1968.21 once or usually twice a day
1970.19 is that it gets me the probiotics
1972.11 that I need for gut health.
1973.79 Our gut is very important.
1974.9 It's populated by gut microbiota
1977.45 that communicate with the
brain, the immune system,
1979.22 and basically all the
biological systems of our body
1981.59 to strongly impact our
immediate and long-term health,
1985.25 and those probiotics in Athletic Greens
1987.11 are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health.
1990.92 In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number
1992.78 of adaptogens, vitamins,
and minerals that make sure
1994.91 that all of my foundational
nutritional needs are met,
1997.85 and it tastes great.
1999.74 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
2001.21 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
2004.6 and they'll give you
five free travel packs
2006.58 that make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens
2008.86 while you're on the road, in the car,
2010.18 on the plane, et cetera,
2011.47 and they'll give you a year's
supply of vitamin D3+K2.
2014.89 Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
2017.56 to get the five free travel packs
2018.94 and the year's supply of vitamin D3+K2.
2021.94 Okay, so now if we look at
the example of what happens
2024.61 when you sit or lie
down and close your eyes
2027.46 and decide to meditate,
2029.2 you should immediately realize
2030.76 that that's a tremendous shift
2033.28 in your perceptual ability, why?
2036.01 Because that spotlight of attention,
2038.2 while it can be oriented
2040.15 toward, for instance,
what you hear in the room
2042.76 or maybe the feeling of wind moving trees
2046.12 in the environment that
you happen to be in,
2048.01 when we close our eyes,
2049.6 we shut down one of the major
avenues for sensory input,
2053.44 which is vision.
2055.3 And when we do that,
2056.74 there's a tendency for
those perceptual spotlights
2059.8 to be focused more so on what happens
2063.19 at the level of the surface of our skin
2065.89 and inside of our bodies.
2068.5 And that informs us about
something very important,
2071.59 which is that there are actually two axes
2073.93 or two ends of a continuum of perception.
2076.9 Up until now, I've been
talking about perception
2078.49 and intention as kind of the same thing,
2080.11 and indeed they are, at least
for sake of this conversation,
2083.23 but within that word perception
2085.42 or within that word attention,
there's a continuum,
2088.75 and that continuum has on one end
2091.54 something called interoception.
2093.76 Interoception, spelled with an I,
2096.76 is everything that we sense
2098.11 at the level of our skin and inward,
2100.66 so the sensation inside our stomach,
2102.31 the sensation of our heart beating.
2103.99 Some people can sense their
heart beating pretty easily.
2106.06 Other people have more
challenge doing that.
2109.63 What we are feeling on
the surface of our skin,
2111.73 how hot or cold we feel,
that's interoception.
2116.05 In contrast, at the other
end of the continuum
2118.48 is so-called exteroception,
spelled with an E.
2121.72 Exteroception is perception of everything
2124.81 that's outside or beyond
the confines of our skin.
2128.83 So by shutting our eyes,
2130.54 and in particular, in
a meditative practice
2133.06 where we direct our attention
2134.74 toward our so-called third eye center,
2136.48 this area right behind our forehead,
2138.01 which, not so incidentally,
is the prefrontal cortex,
2141.55 or in some cases where people
will focus on their breathing,
2144.64 so the movement of their stomach
2146.11 or the movement of their diaphragm
2147.46 or the lifting of their chest
2148.78 or the extension of their
belly while they breathe.
2151.06 By doing that,
2152.62 we are taking what ordinarily
is a perceptual state
2156.82 that's split between the
outside world, exteroception,
2161.23 and usually also toward our inner state.
2163.81 You know, most people
are generally in touch
2165.58 with how they are feeling
from the skin inward
2167.95 while they are also paying attention
2169.6 to what's outside of them.
2171.04 You can think about somebody,
2171.873 for instance, at a
restaurant or a sandwich shop
2174.1 about to order a sandwich
and you're reading the menu,
2175.99 so that's exteroception, right?
2177.4 The menu is outside the
confines of your skin.
2179.62 And little ideas or maybe
big ideas come to mind
2182.95 about what the roast beef sandwich
2184.33 or the vegetarian
sandwich will taste like,
2186.73 what it will do for you,
2188.29 what's in it, what you like,
what you don't like, et cetera.
2191.11 That's splitting interoception
and exteroception.
2194.62 But when we close our eyes,
we stop, we slow down,
2197.14 we focus on our breathing
or that third eye center,
2200.32 the majority of our perception
then shifts to interoception.
2204.13 And when we shift down
2205.87 to that end of the
continuum of interoception,
2208.9 something very important happens.
2210.97 What happens is that those two regions,
2213.94 the ACC, the anterior cingulate
cortex, and the insula,
2217.45 really ramp up their
levels of neural activity,
2220.45 and that should make perfect sense to you
2221.92 because those are areas of
your brain that are registering
2225.28 and paying attention to
the various sensations
2227.74 of how full or empty your stomach feels,
2230.98 whether or not the surface of
your skin feels hot or cold,
2233.68 and on and on.
2234.76 So by just sitting down or lying
down and closing your eyes,
2237.82 your brain undergoes a massive shift
2239.95 from exteroception to interoception.
2242.59 Now, that's not to say
you can't be distracted
2244.33 by external events, and,
in fact, many people are,
2246.64 but the early stages of transitioning
2248.44 into a meditative state
2250.15 involve this shift down the continuum,
2253.15 or, I should say, to
one end of the continuum
2254.92 because there's no down-up,
there's just the continuum,
2258.1 shift along the continuum
2259.66 to heightened levels of interoception.
2262.42 Now, I mentioned this briefly before,
2263.98 but many people are very
interoceptively aware
2269.5 just naturally, even if they
don't do a meditation practice.
2272.44 Other people are not.
2274.0 And there's a pretty good measure
2276.04 of whether or not you have high levels
2277.69 of interoceptive awareness or capability,
2280.09 and that is your ability
to count your heartbeats
2282.46 without placing your fingers
anywhere with any pressure
2285.55 to take your pulse.
2287.38 You can do this if you like,
2288.52 you can actually try and estimate
your number of heartbeats
2291.13 simply by trying to feel your heart beat.
2293.32 Some people are very good,
2294.76 meaning they're very
accurate at doing this,
2296.68 other people are not.
2297.91 It does seem to be an ability
2299.68 that can be trained up quite a bit,
2301.63 and, in fact, meditative practices
2303.1 will improve your interoceptive awareness,
2305.53 but, and this is a very important point,
2309.58 heightened levels of
interoceptive awareness,
2311.71 while that might sound attractive,
2313.69 oh, to be really in touch with your body,
2316.84 that is not always beneficial, why?
2320.05 Because many people who, for instance,
2321.79 have excessive levels of anxiety
2324.67 have excessive levels of anxiety
2326.77 because they are very keenly aware
2329.17 of any subtle shift in their
heart rate or breathing
2332.05 or change in the sensations
within their stomach.
2335.26 Whereas other people who are less aware
2337.06 of their bodily state, that
can be beneficial, right?
2340.03 It can be adaptive or not,
depending on the circumstances.
2343.0 It's probably not adaptive
2344.98 to be very, very aware
of your internal state
2348.28 if, for instance, you're
doing public speaking,
2349.96 you don't want to be thinking
2350.793 about what's going on in your stomach
2351.73 or how quickly you're breathing.
2352.96 I'm certainly trying to
ignore all those signals,
2355.6 those sensations now.
2357.34 But for somebody who has no
awareness of what's going on,
2360.73 very little interoceptive awareness,
2363.04 that can be problematic, too,
2364.9 because these are the very people
2366.55 who can ignore the fact that
they're having a heart attack
2368.5 or can ignore the fact that
they have high blood pressure
2371.41 and are carrying about life
focused on everything external
2374.23 with no awareness of their own body.
2375.91 They're, quote, unquote, out
of touch with their body.
2378.73 So we want to be very careful
about placing valence,
2382.99 which is a sort of value of good or bad
2385.27 on interoceptive awareness
versus exteroceptive awareness.
2388.27 More importantly, we want to emphasize
2389.89 that when you undergo
a meditation practice,
2392.65 if it's of the sort where
you stop your movement
2394.93 and close your eyes,
2396.34 you are training for
interoceptive awareness.
2399.37 This becomes important later
when we get into discussions
2402.73 about meditation for reducing anxiety.
2406.06 Some people may opt,
2408.43 in fact, I would say
some people ought to opt
2410.74 for a meditative practice
2411.88 which involves more
exteroceptive awareness,
2414.82 actually a meditation
like a walking meditation
2417.1 or even a seated meditation
2418.57 where they are bringing their focus
2420.04 to a place outside their body
2422.68 as opposed to inside their body.
2424.51 And in fact, there are examples of people
2426.73 who have meditated quite a lot
2428.41 who develop such a
heightened state or awareness
2431.14 of their interoceptive components,
2433.48 that is, just fancy, again, nerd speak
2435.43 for so aware of their
breathing and of their heart
2438.4 and of the state of their gut
2440.23 that it actually is intrusive
for daily activities.
2443.2 So I will ask you to ask this
question of yourself now.
2447.28 Are you somebody who
tends to be very in touch
2450.13 with your bodily sensations,
2451.93 so, for instance, from the skin inwards?
2454.42 Or are you somebody who tends
to be less in touch with
2457.15 or aware of your interoceptive state?
2460.36 There is no right or wrong answer.
2461.86 You don't get an A or an F or a D or a C
2463.87 depending on your answer.
2464.89 It's just a good question
2466.42 for each and every one of us to answer,
2468.13 and I think most people
will answer that it depends.
2471.28 It depends on whether or not
you are in a social setting
2473.68 or whether or not you're alone.
2475.09 But we are going to return to
that answer so keep it in mind
2478.24 because it will become very beneficial
2480.31 in building an optimal
meditation practice for you.
2483.7 But for now, just note,
2484.78 there's this continuum of perception,
2486.601 interoception and exteroception.
2488.23 Closing your eyes increases interoception.
2490.18 Opening your eyes dramatically
increases exteroception
2493.51 just automatically,
2494.95 just automatically because
so much of your brain,
2496.84 in fact, 40% or more,
is dedicated to vision.
2499.39 And this, I should say, for those of you
2500.98 that are low vision or no vision
2502.39 and those of you that are
blind or have poor vision,
2505.03 this entire process is
translated to the auditory,
2508.78 to the sound domain,
2510.88 so it's true for people that can see
2512.98 and it's true for people that can't see.
2514.9 Of course, people that
can't see, closing the eyes
2516.64 doesn't have this huge
shift towards interoception,
2519.49 but there have been a few studies,
2521.56 not as many as I would've liked to find,
2523.12 but a few studies of, for
instance, people who are blind
2526.48 or have low vision, don't see very well,
2528.28 and when they close their ears
2530.17 and they can't hear the external world
2532.06 or they put headphones on or
noise-canceling headphones,
2534.49 then the world inside of
them becomes very prominent
2537.94 relative to the world outside
of them for obvious reasons.
2540.67 So I asked you to ask yourself
2542.08 whether or not you are somebody
2543.22 who tends to be more
interoceptively aware or not,
2546.73 more exteroceptively aware or not.
2549.58 And some of you might not be
able to answer that question,
2551.8 and if you can't, chances are
2553.99 that you are effectively
sliding along that continuum
2556.75 depending on the activities
that you're doing.
2558.91 So you're probably the kind of person
2560.5 where if somebody comes over to you
2561.85 and starts talking to you,
2562.683 you will engage in that conversation,
2564.64 and you don't feel so inside your body
2567.22 that you're thinking
about your heart beating
2568.96 and whether or not you're
flushing red, et cetera,
2570.61 you're going to pay
attention to what they say.
2572.35 Many people, however, when
somebody talks to them,
2575.62 if they have social anxiety
2577.3 or even a slight bit of social anxiety,
2579.64 will be thinking about whether or not
2581.56 their cheeks are flushing
2582.52 or whether or not they
look right or sound right
2584.92 or whether or not they have
something in their teeth.
2586.51 These are normal responses,
2588.31 but they really speak to this issue
2590.29 of whether or not you tend to shift
2591.91 more towards interoceptive awareness
2593.53 or exteroceptive awareness.
2594.79 And, of course, it's context dependent.
2596.41 It will depend on whether or not
2597.52 you're, you know, out
on a date with somebody
2599.2 that, you know, you would
loathe to find out later
2601.84 that you had food in your teeth
2603.76 or whether or not you're with somebody
2604.81 you're more familiar with
2605.68 where that would not really matter much
2607.57 or the other person would
tell you this kind of thing.
2609.91 What does it mean to be at one
location or another location
2613.63 along this continuum of
interoception or exteroception?
2617.08 Well, we know what it
means neurally, right?
2619.33 We know that if you are
more interoceptively aware,
2622.48 your insula and ACC are active,
but that's not very useful.
2625.15 That's not helpful as a
tool. That's just a fact.
2628.0 Now, there have actually been studies
2630.13 of what a meditation practice can do
2632.95 in terms of moving you
along this continuum
2636.01 from where you naturally sit
2638.65 in order to help you function
2640.51 not just during the
meditation but at all times.
2643.6 And in order to illustrate this,
2645.61 I want to start with a description
2646.72 of what is now a classic study.
2649.06 It's a very cool study,
it has a very cool name.
2651.61 It talks about something very important
2653.65 that will come up again and
again in today's conversation,
2655.447 and that's something called
the default mode network.
2658.42 The default mode network
2659.44 is a collection of different brain areas
2661.39 that essentially are active
2662.59 when we're not doing much of anything
2664.57 and certainly is active
when we are not focused
2668.2 on one particular task or
conversation or activity.
2671.71 The default mode network can
be thought of more or less
2675.01 as the network that
generates mind wandering
2678.25 or our thoughts drifting from the past
2680.31 to the present to the future.
2681.79 Remember, earlier, I talked about
2683.05 how your perceptual spotlight
2684.97 can either be two spotlights
or they can merge.
2687.79 Well, similarly, human beings
2689.83 can think about the past, surely,
2691.63 the present, definitely, and the future.
2695.2 And it turns out we can
also split our thoughts
2698.41 just like we can split our perception
2700.45 into two of those three things,
2702.67 so I can think about
the past, a past event,
2705.31 and I can think about the present.
2706.54 I can split my thinking
and my memory in that way.
2709.27 I can also think about the
present and the future.
2711.16 I can also think about
the future and the past,
2714.19 although it's very difficult,
although not impossible,
2717.73 to split one's thinking and memory
2719.98 into the past, the present,
and future simultaneously,
2722.62 not easily done,
2723.88 but pretty easy to split
one's attention and thinking
2727.36 into two of those three things,
2728.92 either the past, the
present, and the future
2731.35 or any two of those three things, okay?
2734.14 Just like with attentional spotlighting,
2735.91 you can place your mind, your
thinking, and your memory,
2738.79 your cognition onto one of those things
2741.64 and be very, very present
2743.26 or the past and the present
and so on and so forth.
2746.32 The default mode network,
2748.54 while it involves a lot
of different brain areas,
2750.61 can be thought of simply as
the network of brain areas
2754.78 that are active when
your mind is wandering
2757.48 between these different time domains.
2759.22 And the paper I'd like to share with you,
2760.78 as I mentioned before,
is now a classic paper,
2762.58 it has a wonderful title,
2764.8 which is A Wandering
Mind is an Unhappy Mind.
2768.22 Now, that sounds almost
like a news article
2769.96 or a news article about
a scientific paper,
2772.6 but that's actually the
title of the scientific paper
2774.82 which was published in
the journal, "Science,"
2776.95 which is one of the three apex journals.
2779.08 You know, scientific
publishing is competitive,
2781.21 but it's especially competitive
2782.95 to get manuscripts accepted
into "Science," into "Nature,"
2786.88 and into the journal "Cell,"
2788.05 so it represents kind of the
Super Bowl, NBA Championships,
2792.31 and Stanley Cup, if you will,
2794.047 for you sports aficionados
of scientific publishing.
2796.69 This is a paper from Matthew
Killingsworth and Dan Gilbert.
2799.6 It was published in 2010,
2801.61 but it's still considered a classic.
2803.11 And this paper, A Wandering
Mind is an Unhappy Mind,
2805.72 has a number of very important points.
2807.16 I'm going to paraphrase
certain elements of it for you
2809.68 because they say essentially
what I would like you to know
2812.26 far better than I could say.
2814.96 So first of all, they
started out with a statement,
2817.45 which I confess I disagree with,
2819.73 which is, "Unlike other animals,
2821.56 human beings spend a lot of time
2823.12 thinking about what is
not going on around them:
2825.67 contemplating events that
happened in the past,
2827.77 might happen in the future,
or will never happen at all."
2830.83 I agree with their assertion
that human beings do that.
2833.71 That's certainly my experience,
2835.3 although I must say,
2836.53 I don't think there's
any evidence whatsoever
2838.96 that other animals don't do it also.
2841.57 So my apologies,
Killingsworth and Gilbert,
2843.88 but I'd be happy to go
toe-to-toe with you on that.
2845.62 I am not aware of any data
that prove one way or the other
2849.19 what other animals are thinking.
2851.92 So let's set aside other animals,
2854.02 and let's focus on the human animal.
2856.48 Now, their point is still a very good one,
2859.06 which is that humans have
this wandering of the mind
2862.45 that they call
stimulus-independent thought.
2864.43 That is, there's nothing
happening to create these thoughts
2867.25 or anything happening in
the immediate environment.
2869.74 These thoughts are just happening
on their own internally.
2872.44 That's the default mode network.
2874.9 This study was important.
2876.28 In fact, it was a landmark study
2877.57 because they did it right about the time
2879.31 that smartphones became
widely available and in use,
2883.33 so again, 2010.
2884.62 So they basically pinged people,
2886.78 they contacted people on their
iPhones many times per day,
2891.91 and they did this for
well over 2,200 adults.
2896.02 They had a mix of male and
female people in this study.
2899.83 The mean age was 34 years,
but there was a range,
2902.05 mean, of course, being average,
2903.67 but there were a range of
different ages and so forth.
2906.61 And at any moment, they asked people,
2908.147 "What are you feeling right now?"
2909.94 And they also asked them,
"What are you doing right now?"
2912.58 So they were looking for
the match or mismatch
2914.65 between what people were doing
and what they were feeling.
2916.75 They were essentially trying to probe
2918.19 what people were thinking about,
2919.75 and they also addressed that.
2921.37 And they came up with a kind
of a bubble chart, if you will,
2925.6 where the bigger the bubble,
2927.37 the more answers came back
about one particular thing,
2930.46 and they assessed whether or not
2931.81 people were happy or not in
that moment, or sad or not,
2934.33 whether or not they were focused
2935.26 on what they were doing or not.
2936.7 There are a lot of bubbles in this chart,
2938.08 so I'm not going to read them all.
2939.46 But the important points
that came from the data,
2942.34 and, again, this is a very large data set,
2944.26 was that, and here
again, I'm paraphrasing,
2946.15 first, people's minds wandered frequently
2948.22 regardless of what they were doing.
2950.98 In nearly half of the samples taken,
2954.37 people were generally
thinking about something else,
2956.71 except, it turns out,
2957.94 there's this one little bubble
2958.93 sitting way far out on the horizon here,
2961.57 people claimed, and I'm
inclined to believe them,
2964.81 that they tend to be very
focused on making love
2968.2 if they were making love in the moment
2969.88 where they were pinged on their iPhone.
2971.08 Now, why their iPhone was
there with them at that moment,
2973.51 I don't know.
2974.343 That wasn't included in this
description of the study.
2977.41 But all the other activities,
grooming and self-care,
2979.87 listening to the news,
watching television,
2983.26 relaxing, working, et cetera, et cetera,
2986.41 during all those activities,
2987.73 people claimed that their
mind wandered a lot.
2989.92 And then they also assessed,
of course, their mood
2992.38 and how those people
felt at any given moment
2995.95 depending on what they were doing
2997.18 and how well their mind and their emotions
3000.93 matched what they were doing.
3002.34 And what they say here is second,
3005.1 they revealed that people were less happy
3006.9 when their minds were wandering
than when they were not,
3009.33 and this was true during all activities.
3012.48 And then third, what people
were thinking at a given moment
3016.98 was far better a predictor
of their happiness
3020.49 than what they were doing.
3021.9 So this is interesting
3022.95 and I think matches a lot
of people's experience.
3025.5 In fact, I think as you
hear about this study,
3027.48 many of you will probably
just say, "Well, duh."
3029.88 I mean, if you're working
and you don't like your work
3031.393 and you're thinking about
something bad that happened,
3034.23 well, then of course you're
not going to be happy.
3037.08 But the key point of this study
3038.52 is that it did not necessarily
have to be the case
3042.69 that people were thinking
about something unpleasant.
3044.94 In fact, if people were working
3047.76 and they were thinking
about something else
3049.5 that was pleasant, that
also made them feel unhappy.
3053.73 In other words, the mismatch
between being in an activity
3057.33 and having our mind elsewhere
3059.52 led people to report themselves
3061.53 as feeling more unhappy in that moment.
3063.69 And when you total this up,
what you find is that people
3065.97 are often not present
to what they are doing,
3068.67 and that is a great source of unhappiness,
3070.8 even if their thoughts are
those of happy, joyful thoughts.
3076.08 So this is interesting
3076.98 and I think runs counter to
what most of us have heard
3080.61 or have been taught,
3081.443 which is, you know, think good thoughts,
3083.13 you know, try and suppress bad thoughts,
3084.72 have a good internal landscape,
3086.67 you know, create a good narrative.
3088.26 That is all true, but
equally if not more important
3093.21 is to have the ability to be fully engaged
3096.12 in what you are doing at a given moment.
3098.04 That is the strongest
predictor of being happy.
3101.01 And there were several other studies
3102.6 that followed up on this,
3103.59 but their conclusion that they put
3104.73 in the final short paragraph of this paper
3106.41 I think really captures it beautifully.
3108.18 They say, and here, I'm quoting directly,
3109.537 "In conclusion, a human
mind is a wandering mind,
3112.92 and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind.
3115.65 The ability to think about
what is not happening
3118.23 in a moment," I added
the in a moment part,
3120.547 "is a cognitive achievement
3122.94 that comes at an emotional cost."
3124.92 So I know I'm not alone in
believing that this paper,
3127.95 A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind,
3129.42 and we will provide a link to this paper
3130.89 in the show note captions,
3132.18 is absolutely key in understanding
3134.82 why a meditation practice is so important
3137.13 because a meditation practice
3139.41 is really about adjusting your place
3141.99 along that
interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum
3146.22 to what you happen to be
experiencing in that moment.
3150.66 And while most people think
of a meditative practice
3152.82 as focusing on what's going on internally
3155.52 with your eyes closed, third eye center,
3157.11 focusing on your breathing, et cetera,
3158.58 for any number of minutes or
maybe even an hour or longer,
3162.57 there are other forms of meditation
3164.22 in which your exteroception dominates
3166.5 and which you are actively
focusing on things outside
3170.4 or beyond the confines of your
skin and internal landscape,
3174.09 and that, too, is meditation.
3177.21 And if we are to take the work
of Killingsworth and Gilbert,
3180.78 this A Wandering Mind is
an Unhappy Mind, seriously,
3183.9 and I know a number of
other laboratories have
3185.91 and have supported this
research with their findings
3188.34 again and again and again,
3189.87 what this means is that meditating
3192.69 is not necessarily a practice that we do
3194.67 divorced from the rest of life.
3197.22 Meditation and mindfulness in particular,
3199.29 being present to what we
are doing in a given moment
3202.98 is one of the essential keys
to happiness and improved mood
3207.45 even if what we are doing is unpleasant.
3210.36 So that brings us to a tool,
3211.83 and it's a tool that any
and all of us can use
3213.9 whether or not you tend to
be interoceptively dominant,
3216.9 right, that you tend to pay more attention
3218.64 to your bodily sensations,
or exteroceptively dominant.
3222.15 And, again, if you don't know
the answer to that question,
3224.46 there's a simple test that you can do.
3226.2 You can just sit down or
lie down, close your eyes,
3229.41 and you can ask yourself or assess
3233.01 whether or not your
attention tends to fleet
3235.89 to things outside of you, right,
3238.86 cars honking or going
by, people in the room,
3242.16 or whether or not you
tend to be able to focus
3243.96 on your internal landscape
3245.19 to the exclusion of exteroception
and attention to things
3247.74 outside the confines of your skin easily.
3250.14 Now, of course, this will
depend on context and situation,
3252.81 even how well rested you are, et cetera,
3254.85 but that's exactly the point.
3256.59 This is the sort of thing you want to do
3259.23 every time you decide to
do a meditation practice.
3262.44 In fact, I would suggest that you use this
3266.34 to determine what meditation
you do at any given moment.
3270.15 So let's say you are somebody
who is a regular meditator
3272.64 or let's say you're somebody
who's never meditated
3274.65 and you'd like to develop
a meditation practice.
3277.26 I suggest that you do a test
3280.38 of whether or not you are
more interoceptively dominant
3282.96 or exteroceptively
dominant in that moment.
3286.38 Again, this is not a personality trait.
3288.51 This is a question about where
you happen to be in a moment.
3291.3 So let's say you're on a
plane or you're in the car.
3293.76 If you're in the car,
3294.593 please don't close your
eyes while driving,
3295.56 that's sort of obvious, but
do this in a safe way, please.
3299.52 But stop, close your eyes,
3302.61 and assess whether or not you can access
3305.7 and focus your attention
primarily on your internal state
3309.75 or whether or not your
attention and perception
3312.21 gets pulled to something
external, to exteroception.
3315.93 And, again, that will vary
3317.91 depending on circumstance and who you are.
3320.04 Then I suggest opening your eyes
3322.11 and trying to focus your attention
3323.91 to something external to you
3326.07 and seeing or evaluating the extent
3328.35 to which you can divorce your perception
3331.26 from sensations that occur
3333.15 at the level of your skin or internally.
3335.7 Now, I should say that
there's no technology,
3337.74 at least not that I'm aware
of, absence of fMRI machine,
3341.82 in which case, you are
inside an fMRI machine
3343.89 while you do this.
3344.73 But unless you are in that experiment,
3346.47 and most of us aren't,
3348.33 there's no technology that
can tell you, for instance,
3351.48 whether or not you are
interoceptively dominant
3353.52 or exteroceptively dominant
3354.9 and whether or not the
ratio is, you know, 75 to 25
3358.17 or what have you at any given moment.
3359.91 You have to assess this subjectively.
3362.04 However, if you sit down, for instance,
3364.59 and you notice that you can
equally split your attention
3366.63 between internal sensations
and external sensations
3369.81 or whether or not you find yourself
3371.01 pulled into external sensations
3372.51 when you're trying to focus inward
3374.31 or you find yourself pulled inward
3376.8 when you're trying to focus outward,
3378.24 well, that will dictate
the sort of meditation
3380.22 that you perhaps ought to
perform in that moment.
3384.45 Let me give an example
of how you would do this.
3386.46 You would stop in some way,
3388.08 so sit or lie down, close your eyes,
3390.21 and evaluate whether or not
you can essentially rule out
3395.13 or eliminate attention
to all outside events.
3398.55 Most people won't be
able to do that entirely,
3400.56 but try and focus your attention,
3401.76 for instance, on your breathing
3402.68 or the typical third eye center,
3404.1 you know, focusing at a spot
right behind your forehead.
3406.47 If you feel you can do
that reasonably well
3408.24 to the exclusion of what's
happening around you,
3410.64 well, then an important question arises.
3413.67 Should you meditate in a way
3415.26 to enhance that interoceptive awareness?
3417.72 Or rather, should you meditate in a way,
3420.06 for instance, with your eyes open
3421.62 and your attention on a particular portion
3423.42 of the landscape you're in
3424.47 like a tree or maybe even,
you know, an object or a plant
3428.91 or something else in your
immediate environment
3430.95 to try and cultivate
3432.36 or enhance your exteroceptive awareness?
3434.82 That's up to you, but my bias would be one
3437.64 in which you work against
your default state.
3440.61 Again, the default mode
network is where you land
3444.36 on this interoceptive-exteroceptive
continuum.
3447.273 It's going to lead to more mind wandering,
3449.76 whereas when you encourage
3451.92 or we could even say force
yourself a little bit
3454.2 to anchor your attention
3455.82 to either inside your
body or outside your body,
3459.36 and you make that decision
3460.59 according to what you
are doing less easily,
3464.73 well, then you are actively
training up the neural circuits.
3468.69 You are engaging
so-called neuroplasticity,
3470.7 the brain's ability to change
in response to experience.
3472.92 You are deliberately engaging a shift
3477.15 along that continuum.
3478.56 To make this crystal
clear, what I mean is this.
3480.3 Let me give an example.
3481.55 If I were to sit down and I
wanted to do some meditation,
3485.04 let's just say three
minutes of meditation.
3486.63 There's good evidence that even
three minutes of meditation
3489.09 can be beneficial for a variety of things,
3490.95 including enhanced focus and
enhanced anxiety management.
3495.18 Let's say I sit down
3496.02 and I notice that I
can really focus inward
3498.69 on what's happening at
the level of my skin
3501.15 and my internal organs, and
I can rule out everything.
3504.99 Maybe that's 'cause the room is quiet
3506.37 or maybe it's just because
my brain is in a state
3508.95 that I'm particularly good
at that at that moment
3511.92 or maybe it's just a natural ability.
3513.93 Well then I would opt for a
three-minute meditation practice
3517.02 in which I deliberately exterocept,
3520.05 that I build up the circuitry
3521.88 to focus on something external to me
3524.4 because I want, and I think
most people would like,
3527.22 to have an adaptive mechanism within them
3530.4 so that they can slide
along that continuum
3532.47 and they don't default
3534.15 to whatever happens to be
easiest for them in that moment.
3537.72 Now, if I were to sit down
3539.1 and try and focus on
what's going on internally
3541.11 and I kept getting distracted
3542.28 by things happening outside of me,
3543.72 opening my eyes or feeling like
I need to reach for my phone
3546.27 or paying attention to
the sounds in the room,
3548.31 well, then I would actively
engage a meditation practice,
3550.97 in this case, a three-minute
example but it could be longer,
3554.07 where I'm deliberately
trying to focus my perception
3557.79 on events at the level of
the confines of my skin
3560.58 and internally.
3561.81 Why do I say this?
3562.643 Well, you know, I love to use
the phrase anytime with kids,
3566.7 you know, when they say
"This is really hard
3568.32 or something's challenging,"
3569.34 or adults will say, "That's really tough."
3571.14 Well, as my graduate advisor used to say,
3573.69 that means you're learning.
3575.1 If something were easy,
3576.27 if you can perform any
activity or thought, et cetera,
3579.21 well, then there is absolutely zero reason
3581.64 for your neural circuits to change.
3583.65 It's the friction, it's the
feeling that something is hard
3586.38 that turns on the enormous
variety of mechanisms
3589.56 at the level of cells, et cetera,
3591.18 that allow you to potentially
change your neural circuitry.
3594.15 So challenge and discomfort
3596.91 is the signal to your brain and body
3599.37 that something needs to change,
3601.05 so I'm encouraging you to
embark on meditative practices
3605.19 that are not your default, okay?
3608.61 To essentially go against the grain
3611.34 of where your interoceptive
bias or your exteroceptive bias
3615.03 happens to be at a given moment.
3616.71 And, again, this will change.
3617.73 For some of you, this
will change across the day
3620.01 where early in the day,
you are very, very good
3623.28 at doing an
interoceptive-biased meditation,
3626.19 and later in the day, you aren't.
3628.47 I actually believe, based on
the data that I've covered,
3630.6 and we'll get into a few
more papers about this,
3633.09 and my lab is actively
working on this as well,
3635.61 that a meditative practice can
be made far more effective,
3640.8 that is, it can invoke
more neuroplasticity,
3644.1 more shift in brain
states and brain circuitry
3648.06 if we do not take the easy path,
3651.75 that is, we go against the grain
3654.78 of what our brain would
naturally do in a given moment.
3657.81 So if you're in a crowded airport
3659.28 and you're finding that
everything's very distracting,
3661.65 well, then that would be a great time
3664.2 to do some interoceptive
focused meditation.
3666.9 Whereas if you are really in your head,
3669.223 you know, you're looping thoughts
3670.14 about the past and present,
3671.22 maybe you're even in obsessive thought,
3673.14 well, that would be a terrific
time, an ideal time really,
3676.44 to do a short meditation
3678.69 focused on something external to you.
3680.88 In both cases, whether
or not you're focused
3682.83 on interoceptive bias
or exteroceptive bias,
3687.03 you are going against, or I
should say you're pushing back
3690.21 against your default mode network.
3692.37 I would argue it's going
to be far more effective,
3695.31 that is, you're going to
reduce or shift the activity
3698.43 of that default mode network far more
3700.44 and in a far more beneficial way
3702.87 if you actively try and suppress your bias
3706.2 toward being more
interoceptive or exteroceptive.
3708.78 Now, I think that's immensely beneficial,
3710.97 both for the immediate
changes that you experience,
3713.37 what others have called a state change,
3715.83 because that's what it is,
3717.33 and it also can lead to,
as we referred to earlier,
3720.87 more neuroplasticity, more
changes in the brain circuits
3723.96 that underlie your default mode network
3726.45 and lead to what are called trait changes.
3728.4 And I want to be very clear
that I am not the first
3731.13 to make this state
versus trait distinction.
3733.86 That's a distinction that was raised
3735.66 in a really wonderful book.
3737.16 In fact, I can't recommend
this book highly enough.
3739.17 The book is "Altered Traits:
Science Reveals How Meditation
3742.23 Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body."
3744.99 This is a book by Daniel
Goleman and Richard Davidson
3748.02 who've done terrific
work and many writings
3750.24 and many TED Talks, et
cetera, about meditation.
3752.64 I would say that circa 2016, 2017,
3756.39 this book really captured
3758.46 what I believe to be the
most essential elements
3761.25 of the science of meditation
3762.48 and a lot of the history of it as well.
3764.64 Today, we are focusing
3765.69 on much of what's covered in this book
3767.25 but also a lot of things
3768.083 that have happened, excuse me, since 2017.
3770.85 In fact, most of the papers
that I'm going to talk about
3772.95 are papers that were published after 2017.
3775.503 But, again, this is a wonderful book
3776.94 where they very clearly distinguish
3779.04 between state changes and trait changes,
3781.14 trait changes being the
more long-lasting ones.
3783.87 My read of this book and
the literature that follows
3787.35 is, again, that when you
sit down to meditate,
3791.1 it is going to be most effective
3793.23 to do that interoceptive,
exteroceptive bias assessment.
3796.77 Ask yourself whether or not
you are more in your head
3799.17 or outside your head, if you will,
3801.3 and then to do a meditation practice
3803.31 that runs counter to
where you happen to be at,
3807.06 that is, that pushes you more externally
3809.34 if you're in your head,
3810.54 and if you're more focused on
what's going on around you,
3813.09 that pushes you more internally.
3815.07 Now, I think most people are familiar
3816.48 with how to do an
interoceptive-biased meditation.
3819.27 Again, that would be setting a timer.
3820.62 Maybe you don't have even set a timer,
3821.94 you just sit or lie down, close your eyes,
3823.35 focus on that third eye
center behind your forehead
3826.17 or focus on your breathing
or your bodily sensations.
3828.96 That's typical and often discussed.
3830.58 Exteroceptive based meditations,
3833.64 you pick a focal point outside
3836.88 or beyond the confines of your skin,
3838.65 so that could be, for
instance, a point on the wall
3841.05 if you are indoors, it could be a plant,
3843.48 it could be a point on
the horizon far away.
3846.39 What you will find is
that your visual system
3849.27 will fatigue a little bit
3850.32 when you concentrate your
visual focus at that location.
3852.75 I want to remind you
that it is perfectly okay
3855.09 and, in fact, necessary to blink,
3857.13 so you should blink,
you can relax your face,
3858.87 you can change your expression.
3860.01 There is no rule that says
that you can't do those things.
3862.65 This is not, you know, just
beaming a particular location
3865.71 in space and holding your eyelids open.
3867.63 I've been accused many times
of not blinking very often.
3870.12 That's for other reasons.
3871.02 It's part of the way I access memory
3873.18 about what I want to say.
3874.2 I don't use a prompter here,
3875.49 so I'm accessing from a sort
of internal image in my head.
3880.23 That's how my memory works.
3881.4 But in any case,
3882.63 if you're going to do an
exteroceptive-biased meditation,
3885.84 there is absolutely no reason
3887.22 why you wouldn't look
away from that location
3889.41 every once in a while
3890.25 in the same way
3891.45 that if you were focused
on internal thoughts
3893.4 with your eyes closed and
focused on your breathing,
3895.47 every once in a while,
3896.55 your thoughts will skip
away from that breathing
3900.57 or from your third eye center.
3901.68 In fact, and this is discussed
in the book "Altered Traits"
3905.19 but by many other people as well,
3907.59 one of the key elements of
any meditative practice,
3910.14 whether or not it's
interoceptively focused
3912.3 or exteroceptively focused,
3914.25 is that it's really a refocusing practice.
3917.64 The more number of times that
you have to yank yourself back
3921.27 into attending or perceiving
one specific thing.
3924.12 In other words, the more
times your mind wanders
3926.16 and you bring it back,
3927.54 actually the more
effective that practice is.
3929.88 Again, if you can just
focus on one location
3932.13 with laser precision
3933.12 and your mind never darts away from that
3934.86 and you don't have to bring it back,
3935.76 well, then there's no neuroplasticity,
3937.5 nothing needs to change
because your nervous system
3940.14 will effectively know
it's performing perfectly.
3942.33 So if you're somebody who
tries to do meditation
3943.857 and you find that your mind just wanders,
3945.6 just remember every
time you scruff yourself
3947.73 and pull yourself back
3948.66 to focusing on some location externally
3950.88 or focus back on your breath
or your third eye center,
3953.46 each one of those aren't just
opportunities to do better,
3956.79 they are essential to
the improvement process.
3960.3 Think about them as ascending
a staircase of refocusing.
3963.48 Every time you refocus, you're
going up one more level,
3966.54 another stair, another
stair, another stair,
3968.97 and I think that will move you away
3971.01 from the kind of judgmental process
3972.96 of thinking, "Ugh, like, I
can't focus on anything."
3974.91 Pretty soon, what you'll notice
3976.47 is that the refocusing
process will happen so quickly
3980.55 that you don't even perceive it.
3982.17 And, again, this is
something that's borne out
3983.94 in the neuroimaging data.
3984.93 A lot of people think that they can focus
3987.66 with laser precision,
3988.98 but actually, what they
are better at doing
3990.63 is refocusing more quickly
and consistently over time.
3994.08 There's a classic study about this
3996.0 in very experienced meditators
that was done in Japan
3998.34 where they had people
3999.96 with varying levels of meditation ability,
4002.45 so some who had never meditated,
4004.31 others who were really expert meditators
4006.08 with many hundreds if
not thousands of hours
4008.33 of meditation under their belt,
4009.65 and they had those
people listen to 20 tones
4012.89 repeated over and over, the same tone,
4014.87 and they found that the expert meditators
4016.91 could really focus, and they
did this by brain imaging,
4020.18 they could really focus on all 20 tones,
4022.46 whereas most people kind of attenuate
4024.29 or what's called habituate to the tone
4025.79 so that by the 10th or 11th tone,
4027.08 their mind is really
going to something else.
4029.54 Now, that's wonderful, but
that really just tells us
4032.45 the expert meditators have better focus.
4034.34 But it turns out that the more
modern neuroimaging studies
4038.03 have shown that they
don't have better focus
4039.62 such that they're staying in
a very narrow trench of focus.
4042.44 What they're doing is
they're exiting focus
4044.15 and going back in more quickly,
more quickly, more quickly
4046.31 over and over again.
4047.51 So rather than think about
your ability to focus,
4050.09 think about your ability to refocus,
4052.1 and the more number of
times you have to refocus,
4054.2 the better training you're getting.
4055.76 So earlier, I mentioned doing
this interoceptive-biased
4058.16 or exteroceptive-biased
meditation for three minutes.
4061.46 Why did I say three minutes?
4062.54 Well, three minutes seems
like a reasonable number
4064.25 for most people to do
consistently, you know, once a day.
4068.24 And in fact, there are some studies
4069.76 of one-minute meditations
and three-minute meditations
4071.917 and 10 and 60.
4073.7 My laboratory has been studying
a 5-minute-a-day meditation,
4076.79 and that clearly has benefits,
4078.71 but I think it's also clear
that by three minutes,
4082.94 many of the benefits
are starting to arrive.
4085.16 And so while I'm not pointing
4086.96 at any one particular data point here,
4089.45 it's very clear that forcing oneself
4093.02 to direct one's perception,
that is, your attention,
4097.25 to your internal state or
to something external to you
4100.91 is immensely beneficial
if you do it consistently
4103.25 and is, again, especially beneficial
4105.59 if you're focusing your attention
4107.69 on the portion of your experience,
4110.57 either internal or external to you,
4112.46 that is not the one
4113.81 that you would default to in that moment.
4116.12 And some people have taken
this to the extreme to say
4118.22 that, you know, you can even
just move about your day,
4120.29 and then every once in a while,
4121.28 just do a one breath meditation.
4123.41 To be honest, when I look
at the whole of the data,
4126.11 it seems as if it doesn't really matter
4129.77 in order to derive most of the benefits
4131.81 of a meditation practice.
4133.22 Now, I'm a big fan of some
of the newer meditation apps
4136.31 that are out there.
4137.143 One in particular that I've been using
4138.557 and that actually I started using
4140.21 because my dad is a big fan of it
4142.04 and he does now fairly long meditations.
4144.23 He's doing about 10 or 20 minutes
4146.24 at least every other
day and often every day,
4148.22 and he convinced me to
check out the Waking Up app
4150.89 that Sam Harris has put out.
4153.56 I looked at it, I think some
of it sits behind a paywall,
4157.04 but you can access much of
it or at least do a trial
4160.49 and try it out without having
to get behind that paywall.
4163.01 They're not a sponsor of this
podcast, I should mention,
4165.29 but I decided to use the Waking Up app.
4167.06 I think it's terrific,
4168.14 and I think one of the
reasons it's terrific
4169.97 is that Sam includes short descriptions
4172.19 of what meditation is doing
4173.777 and what a specific
meditation can do for you
4176.6 just prior to doing that meditation.
4178.73 So those meditations can be quite brief.
4180.41 Some of them are a minute
long, two minutes long,
4182.3 some are longer or even
quite a bit longer.
4185.15 That app, I think, includes
a variety of meditations
4188.12 that really encompasses the
huge range of possibilities
4192.05 that are possible with meditation,
4193.7 and that, at least by my
experience of the Waking Up app,
4197.24 has led to my most consistent
meditation practice.
4200.84 And, of course, I would love to get Sam
4202.37 on the podcast as a guest
4203.57 so we could talk about
the sort of underpinnings
4206.36 of the Waking Up app
4207.29 and his views on
everything from meditation
4209.54 to, I know he's big in the discussion
4211.55 about free will and consciousness,
4212.99 some of the very deep and
somewhat abstract discussions.
4215.54 I really hope to get Sam on the podcast
4217.25 at a time not too far from now.
4219.02 Meanwhile, we've never met in person,
4221.39 but I absolutely love
the Waking Up app, Sam,
4224.3 and I know my father does as well,
4226.19 and I know many of you already use it.
4227.75 If you haven't tried it already,
4228.86 I really do encourage you to check it out.
4230.84 I want to talk just briefly
4232.01 about this third eye center business
4234.02 because it turns out to
be pretty interesting.
4236.39 The third eye is actually a name
4238.31 that's been given to
another neural structure,
4241.37 or I should say structure
because it's not strictly neural,
4243.77 and that's the pineal gland,
4245.39 and this has an interesting history.
4247.31 I promise I'm not taking
off on a tangent here
4249.62 that isn't relevant to meditation.
4251.99 So you have a brain of course,
4254.3 and on both sides of your brain,
4255.83 you tend to have mirror
symmetric representations
4258.65 of the same things.
4259.483 What do I mean by that?
4260.367 Well, you have a prefrontal
cortex on the right,
4261.68 you have a prefrontal cortex on the left,
4263.09 and they actually do
slightly different things.
4264.83 Language is sometimes
lateralized to one side,
4267.02 but in general, for every structure
4269.87 that you have on one side of the brain,
4271.43 you have the same structure
4272.263 on the opposite side of the brain.
4274.01 There's one clear exception to that,
4275.93 and that's the pineal gland.
4277.34 The pineal gland is the
gland that makes melatonin,
4280.82 which, at night when it gets
dark, secretes melatonin,
4285.32 and that melatonin makes you sleepy,
4286.85 it helps you fall asleep
but not stay asleep.
4288.56 Descartes, right, the
philosopher Descartes
4290.87 asserted that the pineal
was the seat of the soul
4293.45 because it was the one
structure in the brain
4296.12 that he saw was not on
both sides of the brain,
4299.21 it was only one of them and in the middle.
4301.82 Now, I don't know if it's
the seat of the soul or not,
4303.98 I'm not in a position to
make assessments like that.
4307.88 But what do we know about the pineal?
4309.59 The pineal, as I mentioned,
4310.79 is involved in releasing melatonin,
4312.38 it does a few other things as well,
4314.36 but it is also considered the third eye
4318.83 for a couple of reasons.
4320.0 One is that it responds to light,
4323.12 although, in humans, not directly.
4324.95 So in birds and lizards and snakes,
4326.66 they actually either have a thin skull,
4328.28 or, believe it or not, two
holes in the top of their skull
4330.65 that allow light to go directly in.
4332.63 If you look at the head of a snake,
4334.58 light can go directly into
their brain through these holes
4338.3 and activate the pineal
to suppress melatonin
4341.51 and control their
wakefulness, sleep rhythms.
4344.96 In birds, they don't have
holes in their skull,
4346.82 but they have very thin skulls.
4348.26 And, believe it or not,
4349.1 light can penetrate the thinness
of the skull in many birds
4353.75 and communicates information
about time of day
4356.84 and even time of year,
4358.04 and that's translating to hormonal signals
4360.23 such as melatonin release from the pineal.
4362.42 And so the pineal has
been called the third eye
4365.03 because it's a light-sensitive
organ inside the brain.
4368.3 In humans, the pineal sits
deep, deep, deep to the surface,
4373.22 and light cannot get in there.
4374.57 In fact, if light can get into your brain,
4377.27 unless you are part of
a specific experiment
4379.46 where that's the intention
4381.26 or you're having neurosurgery
or something of that sort,
4383.66 then you've got serious issues happening.
4386.48 That pineal sits deep, deep, deep
4388.64 near what's called the fourth ventricle,
4390.86 and it absolutely should
not see light directly.
4394.82 So the idea that the pineal
4396.07 is the third eye in humans is not true.
4399.8 It just isn't true.
4400.633 So anytime someone says, "Oh,
the pineal is your third eye."
4403.31 That's not the third eye center
that people are referring to
4406.37 when they talk about meditation.
4408.44 Now, you'll see a number
of different forms of art
4412.58 where it will be a picture of a face
4415.73 and the eyes will be
closed or sometimes open,
4417.35 and there'll be literally a third eye,
4418.61 like a cyclops eye in the
middle of the forehead.
4421.58 That has been proposed for
many thousands of years
4424.85 to be, quote, unquote, the
seat of our consciousness.
4428.0 Now, that's interesting
4429.08 because that real estate
behind the forehead
4432.35 actually turns out to be
the prefrontal cortex,
4434.18 which we know from lesion
studies and stimulation studies,
4437.24 if you remove that brain area,
people become very reflexive.
4440.96 They are not thinking intentionally,
4443.54 they don't become deliberate.
4444.71 In fact, and this is
kind of an eerie result,
4447.71 but if you inactivate, you
turn off the prefrontal cortex
4453.23 and you give somebody the opportunity
4455.42 to play a shooting game, for instance,
4457.97 their accuracy goes through the roof.
4460.55 They become essentially like a machine.
4461.96 They see a stimulus, they shoot at it,
4463.22 they see a stimulus, they shoot at it.
4464.81 Their accuracy is exceptional,
4466.67 but their ability to distinguish
4469.64 between enemy and friend
completely disappears.
4474.14 So they become a highly effective motor,
4477.23 or I should say sensory motor machine,
4480.2 but their assessment and their judgment
4482.72 about right or wrong
completely disappears.
4485.06 This is also true for people
that have prefrontal damage.
4487.76 They often will have
inappropriate behavior
4489.92 or a hard time suppressing
behaviors, et cetera.
4492.44 So the third eye center
4494.51 as the seat of consciousness
and our intention
4497.54 is something that makes sense generally
4500.27 with what we know about the
neuroscience and neurology,
4502.76 but there's something more to it
4504.05 that I think is especially
important for all of you
4506.21 that goes beyond anything
about ancient traditions
4508.61 or pineals or birds or snakes
4510.2 and pits in the top of the
head, and here's what it is.
4514.19 The brain itself,
meaning the brain tissue,
4517.46 does not have any sensory neurons.
4521.45 What do I mean by that?
4522.32 Well, if I touch the top of
my hand, I can feel that.
4525.59 If I want to sense my heartbeat,
4528.5 if I work at it, I can feel that.
4531.02 If I want to sense how I feel internally
4533.96 at the level of my stomach,
4535.28 is it full, is it empty,
am I hungry, is it acidic,
4537.71 does it ache or does it
feel pleasant, et cetera,
4540.02 I can sense that.
4541.73 And that's because we have sensory neurons
4543.62 on our skin and in our body, et cetera.
4545.3 We also have sensory neurons in our eyes
4546.71 that let us perceive things externally.
4548.6 We have no sensory neurons on our brain.
4551.24 This is one of the reasons
why you can remove the skull
4554.09 and do brain surgery on
somebody who's wide awake
4556.52 and be poking around in there,
4557.54 and they don't need any
anesthetic on the brain itself.
4560.24 They need anesthetic
for the incision site,
4562.97 but they don't need
anesthetic on the brain
4564.44 because it has no feeling.
4566.78 You have emotions, but there's no feeling.
4569.39 So normally, we are perceiving
and paying attention
4573.23 to what we are sensing,
4574.46 either externally, sight and
sounds, again, exteroception,
4577.19 or internally, interoception,
touch, et cetera.
4580.73 But by focusing our
perception and our attention
4584.09 not on our bodily
surface like a body scan,
4587.33 but to a point a couple
centimeters or inches
4590.36 behind our forehead,
4592.4 we essentially are
bringing that attentional,
4594.74 that perceptual spotlight
4596.18 to a location in which
there is no sensation.
4600.2 There's nothing to feel there.
4602.21 And when we do that, by closing our eyes
4604.07 and focusing on that, quote,
unquote, third eye center,
4606.59 which is the prefrontal
cortex, to be quite honest,
4610.28 when we do that, something else happens.
4614.24 And what happens is when
we are not thinking about
4617.51 and perceiving our sensations,
because there are none there,
4621.83 our thoughts and our
emotions and our memories
4624.86 sort of mushroom up.
4626.51 A better way to put it
would be that they geyser up
4629.42 and take on more prominence
in our perception.
4632.87 What I mean by this is that normally,
4635.15 you know, I'm not thinking
about the contact point
4638.09 between me and this chair,
4639.8 but as I'm speaking, I'm
in contact with the chair
4642.77 and those neurons are firing.
4644.51 But if I focus my energy
and attention on them,
4647.54 they're going to fire the same
4648.77 but more of my perception goes there.
4650.45 Similarly, I'm thinking things
all the time. You are too.
4653.39 And I'm perceiving things all the time,
4655.04 and I'm remembering things all the time,
4656.237 and I'm anticipating things
all the time about the future.
4659.27 But by focusing my
attention on the one organ
4662.81 for which I have no sensation,
4665.78 that is, my brain,
4667.55 well, then thoughts,
feelings, and memories,
4672.14 feelings meaning emotional feelings,
4674.78 start to grow in their prominence
4678.11 in my awareness and in my perception.
4680.42 And so this is why
4681.68 when you sit down to
a meditative practice,
4683.63 if it's a meditative practice
where you close your eyes
4685.67 or you're focused on
that third eye center,
4687.71 where you're focused on your brain
4690.56 as opposed to your bodily surface
4692.0 or something external to you,
4693.95 the thoughts seem to come by in waves,
4696.92 and they can almost be overwhelming.
4698.3 It's very hard to, as
it's often described,
4701.42 just sit back and watch
your thoughts go by
4703.19 because there are so many of them.
4704.87 Actually, the best way to stop thinking
4706.43 is to really focus on something external
4709.7 or to focus on sensation.
4711.89 That's less thinking than it
is perceiving senses, okay?
4716.03 So I don't want this to get too abstract.
4718.4 When people talk about
the third eye center,
4719.9 they're not talking about the pineal,
4721.13 they're talking about prefrontal cortex,
4722.45 and when you direct your own attention
4724.37 to the very area of your
brain that directs attention,
4727.34 there's nothing to sense there.
4729.5 The only things that will
become present to you
4732.26 are feelings, emotions, that is,
4736.31 thoughts and memories,
4739.04 and they will often arrive
4740.39 in what seems to be a
very disorganized fashion.
4742.79 And the reason they arrive in
somewhat disorganized fashion
4746.81 is because, normally,
4748.52 we just don't perceive things that way.
4750.59 Normally, we are splitting our attention,
4752.87 our perception, that is,
4754.28 to multiple things, our
sensation and our thoughts.
4757.46 When we put all of our
perception into our thoughts,
4760.13 we see how disorganized,
how wandering they are
4763.37 and how, in fact, how random
and intrusive those can be.
4767.54 Again, random and intrusive.
4769.4 And much of what we talked
about in that paper earlier,
4772.04 the one where they asked people,
4773.42 what are you doing and
what are you feeling
4774.62 and how happy or how unhappy you are,
4776.66 what they discovered was that most people
4780.35 are sort of in their head a lot.
4782.15 They're not really present
to what they're doing,
4784.52 which leads me to the
statement that I believe,
4786.95 at least based on the
data, that paper included,
4789.41 that most people have
an interoceptive bias.
4793.73 They're focused more on
what's going on internally
4796.01 than they are focused on
what's happening externally.
4798.59 There are certainly people
who for the opposite is true,
4802.16 but I think that this is an issue
4804.77 because we hear so often about the need
4807.77 to do a meditation practice
that allows us to focus inward
4811.61 and that we're getting yanked around
4812.9 by all the stressors of
life, et cetera, et cetera.
4815.09 And we are, we're getting yanked around
4816.56 by all the stressors and demands of life.
4818.69 But as we do that,
4820.34 we tend to be very focused
on what's happening with us.
4822.95 The data clearly point to the fact
4824.9 that being mindful and being aware
4827.18 can enhance one's level
of presence and happiness.
4831.05 But we can go so far as to say
4832.91 that being mindful and
aware of what's happening,
4835.07 not just with us
4836.24 but external to us in our
immediate environment,
4838.46 that includes what other
people are saying and doing,
4840.8 that also can really enhance our sense
4843.5 of well-being and happiness.
4844.79 At least that's what the data point to.
4846.5 Let's briefly recap
where we've been so far.
4849.29 We've talked a little bit
about the brain networks
4851.78 that are activated during meditation,
4853.7 which include prefrontal
cortex, ACC, the insula.
4857.3 We also talked about the difference
4858.47 between interoception and exteroception
4861.05 and the importance of
assessing where you are
4864.32 along that continuum.
4865.79 And I should mention, of course,
4866.99 that you can be right in the
middle of that continuum.
4869.66 You might sit down to do meditation
4871.19 and find that you are
smack dab in the middle
4873.47 of being able to attend
to things outside of you
4876.08 but also attending to
things inside of you.
4877.94 In which case, I suggest
doing a meditation
4880.91 that is either exteroceptive-biased
or interoceptive-biased.
4884.45 But as I mentioned earlier,
4886.28 if you find that you are more,
quote, unquote, in your head
4888.98 or in your body,
4889.88 well, then focus on an
exteroceptive-biased meditation
4893.57 to build up that set of circuits.
4895.97 Whereas if you are more
exteroceptively focused
4898.64 at any given moment,
4899.81 well, then I encourage you
4900.74 to do an interoceptively
focused meditation practice.
4903.92 And as I mentioned earlier,
4905.54 there is this issue of
how long to do a practice.
4908.15 There are a lot of
different data on these,
4909.68 but some of the practices
4911.81 we've covered on this podcast before
4913.22 when we had guests, for instance,
4914.84 highlighted the 13-minute meditation
4917.21 that Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New
York University's laboratory
4920.51 has popularized,
4921.74 and they popularized it because
they have a wonderful paper
4924.11 that we will provide a link to
4925.82 which shows that a daily
13-minute meditation,
4929.24 which is of the traditional third eye,
4931.55 interoceptively biased,
focus on breathing,
4933.68 and focus on that location
4935.09 directly behind one's forehead or both,
4937.1 that meditation done daily
for about eight weeks,
4940.01 maybe shorter, but in
that study, eight weeks,
4942.74 greatly improved mood,
improved ability to sleep,
4945.56 improved cognitive
ability and focus, memory,
4948.2 a huge number of metrics were
looked at very specifically.
4951.77 So that's a terrific one.
4952.603 And you may be asking yourself,
4953.84 do you need to do the full 13 minutes?
4955.46 Could you get away with five
minutes or three minutes?
4957.38 Well, my laboratory has shown
benefits in stress reduction,
4960.35 improvement in sleep, et cetera,
4962.09 with a five-minute-a-day meditation.
4965.12 However, in trying to establish
4966.53 how long you should meditate,
4968.12 I would ask yourself
a couple of questions.
4969.77 First of all, what is a practice
4971.48 that you can do consistently?
4973.13 And by consistently,
4974.0 that doesn't necessarily mean every day.
4976.76 If you answer the question
about consistency honestly,
4980.42 and you find that you can only do
4982.04 one meditation session per week,
4984.05 well, then I would encourage
you to go a little bit longer,
4986.06 maybe 10 or 15 minutes,
maybe even 30 minutes.
4988.52 Again, understanding that
you're going to have to refocus
4990.83 repeatedly throughout that meditation
4992.84 regardless of whether
or not you're focusing
4994.25 on internal perceptions
or external perceptions.
4997.19 If, however, you can set aside
5 or 10 or 15 minutes per day
5001.96 and you can meditate every day,
5003.61 well, then I think you
have a bit more flexibility
5006.34 in terms of how long you meditate.
5007.6 Maybe it's three minutes one
day, one minute the next day,
5010.3 10 minutes the next,
and so on and so forth.
5012.49 Just like with exercise, the
key component is consistency,
5015.97 and this is borne out in all the data
5017.59 that's covered in "Altered Traits."
5019.57 It's also borne out in
all the recent studies
5022.09 that have come out since
that book was published.
5024.28 Consistency is key,
5025.54 so ask yourself what
you can do consistently,
5027.91 and also don't necessarily burden yourself
5030.79 with always having to do the same amount
5033.04 or duration of meditation.
5034.6 So earlier, we decided
we were going to parse
5037.15 or fine slice the meditation practice,
5039.64 and indeed we've been doing that.
5041.02 We've talked about interoceptive
versus exteroceptive bias,
5044.74 and we've been talking about
5046.24 where you place your
perception or your focus.
5049.27 Another key component of meditation
5051.91 is the pattern of
breathing that you embrace.
5054.37 In fact, the pattern of breathing
5056.38 that you embrace during
your meditation practice
5058.78 can itself be its own form of meditation.
5062.56 What do I mean by that?
5063.64 Well, these days, we hear
a lot about breathwork.
5066.4 Breathwork has really grown in popularity
5068.5 in the last 5, 10 years,
5070.03 and there are a number
of reasons for that.
5071.56 First of all, I think we
need to credit Wim Hof,
5074.53 or can we call him, I think appropriately,
5076.27 the Great Wim Hof?
5077.53 You know, certainly there
were people before Wim
5079.39 who were doing deliberate breathwork
5080.77 and talking about deliberate breathwork,
5082.6 but it was really about 2015 or so
5086.2 that Wim Hof started to grow
in recognition and popularity
5090.4 for a particular style of breathing,
5092.26 which, in the laboratory, we
call cyclic hyperventilation.
5095.38 I know there are other names for it
5096.85 that come from ancient traditions.
5098.38 He named it, or people
named it after him, Wim Hof.
5102.58 Wim Hof, for those of you that don't know,
5104.68 is a Dutchman who is known
to hold many world records
5109.45 for deliberate cold exposure,
5111.31 including swimming under
icebergs, longest period of time
5114.82 buried in ice up to his neck, et cetera,
5117.07 but who's also expert
5118.39 in the use of breathing in particular ways
5120.49 in order to manage and maneuver
through those challenges.
5123.76 And he started speaking about
5125.2 different patterns of breathwork,
5126.25 in particular, the use of
cyclic hyperventilation,
5129.94 deep, deliberate breathing,
5131.62 so big inhales [inhales],
exhales [exhales],
5134.56 big inhales [inhales and exhales] exhales.
5137.04 In the laboratory, again,
5138.04 we call that cyclic hyperventilation.
5139.57 It's very clear from studies
both done on Wim specifically
5143.32 but on the general population as well
5145.0 by my lab and other labs
5146.53 that that pattern of
cyclic hyperventilation,
5148.66 of deliberately breathing
deeply and repetitively,
5151.51 typically in through the
nose, out through the mouth,
5154.06 generates a lot of adrenaline
5155.47 or causes adrenaline release
from the brain and body.
5158.53 It, quote, unquote, heats up the body.
5161.26 Indeed, it raises body temperature,
5163.06 but the liberation of adrenaline
does a number of things
5165.61 to shift the state of the brain and body.
5168.58 That, more or less, is
what Wim Hof breathing is,
5170.95 although Wim Hof breathing,
5172.3 or some people will
call it tummo breathing
5174.28 or cyclic hyperventilation,
5176.17 is not a pattern of breathing
5177.85 typical of most meditations
that have been discussed,
5181.39 at least not in the research literature.
5183.34 Now, that's not to say that
cyclic hyperventilation
5185.68 can't be incorporated into
a meditation practice,
5188.23 but Wim Hof breathing aka
cyclic hyperventilation/tummo
5192.13 is typically considered
its own practice, okay?
5195.61 Its own breathwork practice
divorced from meditation.
5198.88 It might have a meditative component,
5200.38 but it's not often discussed as meditation
5202.94 or as part of meditation.
5204.61 More typically, a meditation practice
5207.07 involves slowing one's breathing,
5209.47 and this could be in the
form of cyclic breathing
5212.56 of inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, which is cyclic,
5216.16 or, in some cases, doubling up
on inhales and then exhaling,
5219.67 so inhale, inhale, exhale,
inhale, inhale, exhale,
5222.37 or controlling the duration
of inhale, breath hold,
5226.21 exhale, breath hold, repeat,
5228.07 so-called box breathing
5229.51 where the inhale, the hold,
the exhale, and the hold
5232.0 are of equivalent durations.
5234.55 Any number of different
breathing patterns,
5236.71 slow cyclic breathing, box breathing,
5240.25 a cadence of three to six seconds in,
5243.28 holding for two seconds,
and seven seconds out,
5245.77 regardless of what cadence
of breathing one uses,
5249.34 there is a tendency during
most meditative practices
5252.88 to slow one's breathing
and/or control one's breathing
5256.69 in deliberate fashion.
5258.49 This is essential because
when we default our breathing,
5262.3 that is, when we don't pay attention
5264.88 to how long we are inhaling
relative to our exhales,
5268.84 when we don't deliberately exhale,
5271.12 that is, normally we just passively exhale
5274.36 but we actively inhale,
5275.65 I repeat that,
5276.483 normally, when we're not
thinking about breathing,
5278.77 we deliberately inhale,
5280.69 there's a a motor command that's
sent to inflate the lungs,
5283.69 and then we passively exhale.
5285.19 But in many breathwork practices
or meditation practices,
5288.4 we actually actively exhale as well.
5291.85 Well, when we do that, a
number of things happen.
5294.04 First of all, it forces us
into interoception. Why?
5298.33 Because the diaphragm,
5299.35 the muscle that helps
move the lungs essentially
5303.07 and create a specific cadence of breathing
5307.09 or depth of breathing
5308.89 as one would with box breathing
5310.47 or deliberately slow breathing,
5312.49 well, that muscle resides inside of us,
5314.89 and so when we focus on our breathing,
5317.62 more often than not, we aren't focused
5319.51 on the actual air leaving
our nasal passages or mouth,
5322.48 maybe a little bit,
5323.41 but more typically, we are forced to focus
5326.02 or we just default to focusing
5327.61 on the movement of our
diaphragm or of our belly
5330.31 or the rising and falling of our chest.
5333.22 All of that is to say
5334.87 that by deliberately
focusing on our breathing,
5337.63 we shift to interoception.
5341.05 So breathing and specific
patterns of breathing
5343.957 are sort of along for
the ride in meditation,
5348.01 but the reverse can also be said,
5350.14 that when we focus on our breathing,
5352.03 we shift to interoception and
away from external events.
5355.96 It doesn't mean we can't
still pay attention
5357.79 to external events, we
can still exterocept,
5360.55 but at least some portion
of our perception,
5362.83 of our attention shifts to interoception.
5366.55 So we of course need to
breathe to stay alive.
5370.18 We have to breathe at least every so often
5372.49 in order to stay alive,
5373.48 so, of course, breathing is
part of any meditative practice,
5376.72 just like it's part of any
living activity, even sleep.
5380.89 But if the first component of meditation
5384.13 is to direct our perception
in a deliberate way,
5387.85 using that prefrontal cortex,
5389.2 to a specific location,
either on the surface of
5392.2 or within our body or
external to our body,
5396.49 or both, but typically one or the other,
5398.74 then we can say that the second element
5401.41 of a meditative practice is
the pattern of breathing,
5404.89 and we can ask ourselves,
5407.11 can it and should it be deliberate or not?
5410.13 In other words, do we just default
5411.64 to however we happen to be breathing,
5413.32 or should it be deliberate?
5414.4 That is, should we be controlling
the depth and the cadence?
5418.33 And I do believe that,
5419.98 based on what we know about the capacity
5422.02 for specific patterns of breathing
to shift our brain state,
5426.01 that controlling one's
pattern of breathing
5428.53 during meditation can
be enormously useful,
5431.02 and that is true regardless
of whether or not
5433.33 one is focusing on interoceptive
perceptions within our body
5438.67 or exteroceptive perceptions.
5441.73 So that raises the question,
5442.78 how should we breathe during meditation?
5444.82 Well, there is, again,
5447.04 no simple one-size-fits-all rule there,
5449.95 but there are some general
rules of respiration physiology
5453.64 that can help us access and
develop a meditation practice
5457.24 that is going to best serve our goals.
5459.64 And since this is not an
episode all about respiration,
5463.06 and we will do one,
5464.95 I simply want to give you the basics
5466.9 of what respiration can do
5468.4 to shift your brain and body state.
5471.55 Before I do that, however,
5472.96 I want to give a very
specific instruction,
5476.05 which is when you sit down to meditate,
5478.24 or if you're going to do
your meditation walking,
5480.61 that's fine too.
5481.443 I should just say when
you are about to begin
5483.61 your meditative practice,
5485.32 you need to ask yourself a question.
5488.38 Do you want to be more relaxed
than you are at present,
5493.36 or do you want to be more
alert than you are at present
5496.51 when you exit the meditation practice?
5499.06 Do you want to calm down,
5500.53 or do you want to become more alert?
5502.27 Simple question. You can
decide from session to session.
5506.5 You could even switch within a session.
5508.33 But just as you need to
assess whether or not
5510.22 you are leaning more
interoceptively or exteroceptively,
5514.66 you also need to ask yourself,
5516.52 do you need to calm down
or want to calm down,
5518.47 or do you want to be more alert
5519.88 at the end of your meditation session?
5521.71 Or maybe you want to go into
a state of deep relaxation
5523.99 and then exit with more alertness.
5526.69 The way to do that is very simple
5528.64 using breathwork and specific
patterns of breathing.
5532.12 And here is the general
rule that is supported
5535.09 by all the respiration
physiology that I'm aware of.
5538.78 I'm oversimplifying here,
5539.98 but I'm oversimplifying intentionally
5542.23 so you can simply apply the tool.
5543.88 And then, as I mentioned
before, we will do an episode
5546.37 all about respiration
physiology in the future.
5550.12 Essentially, if your inhales
5554.77 are longer and/or more
vigorous than your exhales,
5558.58 then you will tend to be more alert
5561.76 or you'll shift your brain and body
5563.08 towards a state of more alertness.
5564.55 This is simply based on the
way that the neural circuits
5567.91 like the pre-Botzinger nucleus
and the parafacial nucleus
5570.25 that govern respiration
physiology and alertness,
5573.16 it's simply the way they work.
5574.24 They communicate with brain areas
5575.47 that release noradrenaline
and norepinephrine, et cetera.
5580.15 In contrast, if you
emphasize longer duration
5585.25 and/or more vigorous exhales
relative to your inhales,
5590.56 you will tend to relax more,
5592.48 you will tend to calm your nervous system.
5594.88 Now, you might be saying,
"Okay, I understand what it is
5596.86 to make an inhale longer than my exhale,
5599.47 but how do I make it more vigorous?"
5601.12 Well, it simply means drawing
more air into your lungs
5603.61 more quickly than you allow
yourself to exhale that air.
5608.59 So an example of inhale-biased breathwork
5611.77 would be [inhales and exhales]
[inhales and exhales],
5615.85 so there's an active
emphasis on the inhale,
5618.85 and it's a little bit
longer than the exhale
5620.71 which is passive.
5623.11 Conversely, if you want to relax,
5625.48 then you want to extend your exhales
5627.28 relative to your inhales,
5628.27 and you can even make them active exhales.
5630.55 So it can be inhale [inhales and exhales],
5634.36 exhale [inhales and exhales].
5637.81 That's going to shift your nervous system
5639.73 in a direction of more calm.
5642.7 And, of course, if you would like to stay
5644.98 at the level of alertness aka calmness
5648.31 because those are two sides
5649.33 of the same seesaw or the same continuum,
5651.91 if you'd like to be right where you're at
5653.89 at the end of your meditation
as where you started,
5656.38 at least in terms of levels
of alertness and calmness,
5658.93 well, then you would just keep
your inhales and your exhales
5662.02 relatively balanced in terms of duration.
5664.78 Now, the introduction of
things like breath holds
5666.73 with box breathing or Wim Hof breathing,
5669.37 typically, it's 25 or
30 deep inhale, exhales,
5673.12 deep inhale, exhales, and
then exhale all your air,
5675.79 hold your breath for 15 to 60 seconds,
5677.8 and then repeat and so on,
sometimes some inhales and holds.
5681.28 Well, that's a whole business into itself.
5683.59 But for sake of meditation,
the key thing to understand
5687.25 is that if you are going to do
5688.78 a complicated breathing practice,
5691.72 it will, by design, by necessity,
5694.66 shift much of your attention
to the breathing practice,
5697.9 especially if it's not cyclic,
5699.16 if it's not inhales follow exhales.
5701.05 Cyclic breathing is where
inhales always follow exhales,
5703.42 follow inhales, follow exhales.
5704.65 It actually relies on
a specific brain center
5706.96 called the pre-Botzinger complex
5708.31 discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.
5710.08 He was a guest on this podcast previously.
5713.44 However, if you are
doubling up on your inhale,
5715.72 so two inhales [inhaling],
and then an exhale [exhales],
5719.68 a pattern of breathing
5720.513 my laboratory has studied extensively,
5722.98 well, then that relies on
a different brain center,
5725.08 the parafacial nucleus.
5726.16 The point is that if you are
engaging in noncyclic breathing
5730.81 or you are deliberately
emphasizing inhales or exhales
5735.34 or the vigor of inhales
and exhales, et cetera,
5738.34 well, then some portion of
your attention will be devoted
5741.64 to making sure that you follow
that breathing practice.
5744.01 We are very good at going into
cyclic breathing practices
5747.46 by default, and our attention
can drift to other things.
5750.55 Interoceptive or exteroceptive,
it doesn't matter,
5753.85 we can just drift into, you
know, how our body feels
5756.49 or something we see or hear
in the room, et cetera.
5759.37 When we are focused on our breathing
5760.84 and the breathing pattern
5761.74 is noncyclic or complex in some way
5765.31 in that it involves
deliberate voluntary commands,
5769.33 again, from those so-called
top-down mechanisms
5772.27 of the prefrontal cortex,
5773.68 well, that, by design,
requires some portion,
5778.6 often a significant
portion of our attention
5780.7 to be devoted to the
breathing practice itself.
5783.58 So what does this mean?
5784.413 This means that breathwork itself
5786.49 can be a form of meditation,
5788.26 and meditation can involve breathwork,
5791.86 but one should know that the
more deliberate and unnatural
5797.68 that pattern of breathing is,
5800.17 the less you will be able
to focus on other things.
5803.26 Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.
5804.94 You can actually leverage this.
5806.08 So for instance, if you are somebody
5807.64 who's very much caught in your own head,
5809.98 right, we talked about this earlier,
5811.87 or you're in a moment where
you're really stuck in your head
5813.577 and you want to get out of your head,
5815.32 well, then that meditation
practice that you do
5817.03 really should be focused
on exteroceptive bias,
5819.37 you should really focus on
something external to you,
5821.35 and I would encourage you
5822.31 to use a natural cyclic
pattern of breathing
5825.49 where inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales.
5828.85 If, however, you are finding
5830.47 that you're sort of
caught in the landscape
5832.78 of things happening around you
5834.34 and you want to ground yourself,
as it's sometimes called...
5837.07 That's a loose language,
not a scientific language.
5839.35 I know there's this practice of grounding,
5840.97 and that's a whole thing.
5841.803 People are always writing to me,
5842.636 "Is grounding a real thing,
walking barefoot on the Earth
5845.35 and magnetic fields, you know,
and gravitational fields?"
5848.14 Well, gravity's real,
5849.49 but, you know, grounding,
5850.78 there isn't a lot of
science for it, to be frank.
5853.45 It does feel nice to walk
on the ground, however.
5855.76 But if you are somebody
who's kind of feeling
5859.09 pulled out of yourself
a lot or in a moment
5861.46 and you want to bring your
awareness into your body
5864.88 and sort of calm down,
5866.44 well, then I would encourage you
5868.24 to, yes, use a deliberate,
somewhat unnatural
5872.35 or non-default pattern of breathing,
5875.59 which, by definition, will force you
5877.87 to attend to what's
going on interoceptively.
5881.89 Again, I'm not aware of any place
5883.27 that this has been discussed
in detail such as this before.
5886.0 If there is a research literature on this,
5888.61 please let me know.
5889.443 My laboratory has been
working on this extensively.
5891.19 I'm always looking for new
colleagues and collaborators.
5894.49 We, meaning Dr. David Spiegel
who's an expert in hypnosis,
5897.49 again, who's been a guest
on the Huberman Lab podcast
5901.18 and my colleague at Stanford Psychiatry.
5902.86 In fact, he's our associate
chair of psychiatry,
5904.72 world expert in hypnosis, he's
been on this podcast before,
5907.18 we have an active research
program focused on these issues.
5910.84 We are very much of the belief
5912.19 that a breathwork practice
itself can be meditative,
5915.43 a meditation practice
can include breathing,
5918.46 but the more that that meditative practice
5920.77 focuses on the breathing itself,
5922.63 the more interoceptive-biased it will be.
5925.24 Now, it's very important to understand
5927.97 that an interoceptive-biased
breathwork practice
5931.15 will have a specific effect,
5933.16 which is to make you more
interoceptively aware.
5936.1 And if you think back to
earlier in the episode,
5938.56 for many people, that
will be a wonderful thing
5940.78 and something that they
are actively seeking
5943.36 or ought to seek
5944.89 because it can help people gain awareness,
5946.99 for instance, you know,
if they're stressed
5949.27 and they're not realizing
it till the end of the day,
5951.01 they're just exhausted,
5952.27 more interoceptive
awareness throughout the day
5954.13 can be very beneficial.
5956.08 If, however, you are somebody
5957.91 who is overly focused on
your bodily sensations,
5960.76 well, then more exteroception
awareness is important.
5963.52 And this brings us to a yet larger theme
5966.25 but a theme that I think really emphasizes
5969.16 what particular types
of meditative practices
5971.35 are going to be best for certain people,
5973.66 especially people who are using meditation
5976.03 to combat certain challenges,
5977.8 in particular, mood-based challenges
5979.54 or sleep-based challenges
or focus-based challenges.
5983.2 I haven't listed off
5984.19 all the positive benefits of
meditation yet in this episode,
5989.38 but they are many, many, many.
5991.87 In fact, there are now tens of thousands
5994.21 of scientific studies
showing, for instance,
5996.91 there are known benefits
of doing meditation
5999.88 for enhancing sleep,
6001.35 there are known benefits of
a regular meditation practice
6003.66 for enhancing focus,
6004.98 there are known benefits of
a regular meditation practice
6007.35 for reducing inflammatory cytokines,
6009.96 even improving outcomes in cancer,
6011.58 reducing pain, improving mood,
6015.3 reducing the symptoms of ADHD
and clinically diagnosed HD
6018.39 and on and on and on.
6020.04 And, again, rather than focus
6022.02 on all those beautiful studies today
6024.21 which all basically point to the fact
6025.65 that some meditation
practice done regularly,
6028.8 even if it's very brief,
6029.94 has tremendous, even outsized
benefits on our health
6032.79 even relative to some drug
treatments, that's been shown.
6036.21 Rather than focus on all
that, I've been more focused
6038.79 on what sorts of brain
and body changes occur
6041.25 when we do a meditation practice
6042.66 and, perhaps more importantly,
6043.86 what really constitutes
a meditation practice.
6046.68 We have this thing about
a continuum of perception.
6049.71 We also now are talking about breathing.
6051.57 Well, there's another component
that I'd like to raise now,
6054.66 which we could say is
the third major component
6056.4 if the first one that I raised
6058.23 was interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias or continuum,
6062.37 the second being breathing,
6064.04 is it going to be default
or deliberate breathing?
6067.14 Is it going to be natural
cadence or unnatural cadence?
6069.75 Again, no right or wrong,
6072.09 it just depends on what your goal is.
6073.98 There's a third component.
6075.96 This is a component,
6077.1 again, that hasn't really been
formalized in the literature
6079.29 but that Dr. Spiegel and I
are working hard to formalize
6083.25 through some research and
through an upcoming review
6085.71 that we will provide
links to once it's out,
6087.51 and that's a separate continuum
which is the continuum
6090.75 between interoception and dissociation.
6095.19 So now all of you know
what interoception is,
6098.01 but most people probably don't know
6100.11 or don't realize what dissociation is.
6102.84 Often we hear about dissociation,
6105.15 sometimes called disassociation.
6107.28 Some people pronounce it
dissociation. Guess what?
6111.0 Despite being corrected many times
6112.53 for each of those pronunciations,
6114.03 I checked with my colleagues
6115.44 who are experts in
dissociation or disassociation,
6119.55 and guess what?
6120.383 They're the same thing.
Tomato, tomato, potato, potato.
6123.78 So I'm going to say dissociation.
6125.7 Some people will say
disassociation, like I disassociate.
6129.51 Other people will say I dissociate, okay?
6132.33 Both of those refer to
essentially the same thing.
6135.6 Dissociation is often talked about
6139.23 in the context of a negative event.
6141.27 And indeed, dissociation is unfortunately,
6145.47 or, I should say, is adaptively associated
6148.26 with traumatic events.
6149.88 In particular, violent or sexual
trauma, people will report
6153.3 feeling out of body or
out of the experience
6157.41 during the experience
6158.25 or during a recollection
of the experience.
6161.25 Dissociation has also been described
6163.65 in terms of people who are
in a traumatic accident
6166.98 or they see someone killed
right in front of them.
6169.26 First responders will
talk about dissociating
6171.27 when they arrive on a scene.
6172.47 I don't want to provide, you
know, gruesome imagery here
6174.39 'cause I know people can be
pretty sensitive to this,
6176.04 but, you know, showing up
on the scene of a car crash
6179.58 and just seeing carnage or
incredible damage to bodies
6184.26 or, you know, this sort of thing.
6186.03 Dissociation lies at the opposite end
6188.19 of a continuum with interoception.
6190.53 Now, earlier, I said that interoception
6192.48 is on the opposite end of a
continuum with exteroception,
6195.27 but it also is on the opposite end
6197.19 of a continuum with dissociation.
6200.13 We can provide some
better definitions perhaps
6202.44 to make this crystal clear,
6204.06 and here, I'm actually reading
from an upcoming review.
6206.58 I feel comfortable reading from it
6207.69 because I'm an author on the review.
6209.1 But nonetheless, interoception
refers to a process
6211.95 by which your nervous system,
6213.24 meaning your brain and
connections with your body,
6214.86 senses, interprets, integrates,
and regulates signals
6217.89 originating from within the body,
6220.56 and thereby provides a
moment-to-moment mapping
6222.84 of your internal landscape
6224.52 at both a conscious and unconscious level.
6226.47 Okay, that's a lot of words
6227.88 to describe basically the process
6230.01 of perceiving what's happening
6231.09 at the level of the surface
of your skin or inward.
6235.74 Dissociation can be thought of
6237.3 as the opposite of interoception.
6240.51 It's a lack of bodily awareness
6242.28 or a removal of one's conscious experience
6246.03 from one's bodily
experience and awareness.
6249.36 Again, this is most often talked about
6251.25 in the context of something traumatic,
6253.26 but really, if we think about health
6256.05 and mental health and physical health,
6258.09 the optimal place to reside
6259.74 on the continuum between
interoception and dissociation
6262.8 is somewhere in the middle.
6263.94 We don't want to be dissociated
from life's experiences,
6266.73 but we also don't want everything
that happens in the world
6270.51 to profoundly impact our
heart rate and our breathing.
6273.09 We'd be yanked around by every experience.
6275.94 There are instances in
which being yanked around
6279.78 or pulled into an experience
6281.31 is something that we desire and want,
6282.69 like seeing a movie that we want to see
6285.03 or, for instance, clinical
hypnosis or falling in love,
6290.43 wonderful experiences
6291.54 and sometimes also sad experiences, right?
6293.7 Being able to feel one's feelings
6295.05 depending on life's events is important.
6298.11 But being too dissociated
or being too feeling,
6302.31 that is, feeling so much
6304.44 in response to everything that
happens is also problematic.
6307.74 There are certain people, for
instance, that have challenges
6310.44 with what's called narrative distancing.
6313.11 That is, they see someone
in a movie getting hit
6315.18 and they almost flinch as
if they are getting hit.
6318.3 They see someone who's
scared or happy in a movie
6321.87 and they feel scared or happy
6323.4 in a way that seems like
they're along for the ride
6326.13 a little bit too much.
6328.17 This is important
because what it speaks to
6330.54 is the ability for that...
6332.16 Remember way back at the
beginning of the episode,
6334.11 that ACC, that anterior
cingulate cortex and the insula.
6338.31 We've got a prefrontal cortex
6339.45 that can say, hey, let's be rational.
6342.39 That movie, that person
who's happy or sad,
6345.12 that person in your environment
who's breaking down crying,
6348.45 yes, they're sad, it's
important to be sympathetic,
6350.88 maybe even empathic towards them,
6352.95 but let's not get pulled
into the experience
6354.93 so much that we lose ourselves.
6356.7 And then of course there
are areas of your brain
6359.58 that are also leaning on,
and here I'm using metaphor,
6364.2 but they're leaning on the
insula and ACC and saying,
6367.77 hey, there's somebody that
I care about that's upset,
6370.08 I'm also going to be upset,
6371.22 or somebody I care about is happy,
6372.45 I'm also going to be happy,
6373.74 or they're scared so I'm
also going to be scared.
6375.33 So it's a push-pull
between our recognition
6378.54 that we are each distinct entities
6380.73 and also, of course,
the very healthy desire
6383.16 to be attached to others' experiences
6385.44 and the experiences around us.
6387.21 So why am I raising yet
another continuum, right?
6390.03 We already have the one continuum
6391.95 of interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness.
6395.43 Well, if we want to think
about how meditation
6398.58 can serve our mental health
and our ability to focus,
6403.77 there's a very particular mental
model that we can arrive at
6408.0 that incorporates this
interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
6412.38 Again, if you are extremely interoceptive,
6414.69 you're feeling everything in your body,
6417.81 and those feelings in your body
6419.01 nearly completely account
for all of your experience
6421.41 if you're at that far
end of the continuum.
6423.48 On the dissociative end of things,
6425.73 you can see what's going on,
6427.56 you can react to what's going on,
6429.69 but your bodily response to
that is essentially shut down.
6433.26 You could either be paralyzed shut down,
6435.09 so kind of no movement,
6437.1 or you could still be
engaging in behaviors
6440.13 but you're dissociated.
6441.66 Again, sadly, this is often
what victims of trauma report,
6445.35 that they are able to just
go through the motions
6447.15 but just shut off their emotions
6448.65 or their emotions just shut off.
6450.48 They aren't feeling the elevated
heart rate or breathing.
6453.12 Sometimes they can even be quite scared,
6455.79 but they're not even perspiring
6457.08 or showing any signs of autonomic arousal,
6459.54 that is, fright or stress or panic.
6463.32 So let's talk about this model
6464.55 of interoception and dissociation
6467.25 and then a meditative practice
6469.5 that can be used to try and
anchor us at the right location
6473.01 or the healthy location
along that continuum.
6476.16 Let's first imagine the
ideal mental health state.
6480.03 And here, I want to
acknowledge, nobody achieves
6483.54 or at least maintains
this mental health state.
6485.43 I want you to imagine that where you are
6488.31 along this
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum
6491.82 is like a ball bearing,
6493.26 or you represent a sphere
6494.91 that can roll back and
forth along the continuum.
6497.28 At one end, you have pure interoception,
6499.29 you're just feeling everything.
6500.43 At the other end, you're
completely dissociated.
6502.65 Well, in this one
version of mental health,
6505.95 we take that continuum
and we fold up the sides
6509.25 so that it looks like a V, okay?
6512.73 On one end, you have interoception.
6513.99 On the other end, you have dissociation.
6516.03 I realize a number of
people are listening to this
6517.257 and not watching this on YouTube
6518.76 so they can't see that my hands are now,
6521.19 the heel of my hands are together,
6523.8 the fingers of my hands are
apart so it looks like a V,
6526.26 and you are like a ball bearing.
6527.82 Your state is like a ball
bearing at the base of that.
6530.359 You are in a trench
6531.192 of perfectly balanced
interoception and dissociation,
6535.32 so you can feel things,
6536.46 you can register what's going
on in the outside world,
6539.13 but your feelings are not
overwhelmed or overtaken
6542.64 by what's happening in the outside world.
6544.05 You are in a perfect place
6545.22 of being able to make rational decisions
6547.05 and yet still feel your feelings.
6549.54 Wouldn't that be lovely?
6550.98 Wouldn't that be lovely
if we could be like that
6552.45 whenever we wanted to?
6553.62 And frankly, nobody is
like that all the time.
6557.31 More typically, the model
of mental health and mood
6560.94 and well-being and perception
of self versus others
6564.45 and internal versus external states
6566.61 is one of more of a U, a U shape,
6570.3 where at one end, we have interoception,
6572.25 and at the other end,
we have dissociation,
6573.9 and it's kind of U shaped,
6575.1 and your state is more or
less like a ball bearing
6579.93 at the base of that U
6581.01 that, you know, it gets
pushed from side to side.
6583.53 Maybe, you know, your
heart races a little bit
6586.05 because of something bad or good,
6587.97 and that ball bearing
shifts towards interoception
6589.98 a little bit more and you notice
that your heart is racing.
6592.47 Or perhaps, at any given moment,
6595.86 you know, your mind drifts a little bit
6597.6 while watching a movie or
while talking to your partner
6600.72 or while your child is
complaining about something
6603.72 and you're thinking about something else,
6604.647 and that ball bearing shifts
6605.79 towards the dissociative
state a little bit.
6607.89 That is a mild form of dissociation.
6610.287 And I think most people would agree
6611.76 that being mentally healthy
6613.53 would involve this kind
of U-shaped model as well,
6616.35 where it kind of can shift back and forth,
6618.51 but it's not extreme.
6619.47 You're not going from interoceptive-biased
6621.72 all the way to dissociated
in any kind of extreme way.
6624.99 The ball bearing stays down
near the base of that U.
6629.16 Then, of course, there are states
6630.39 that we all, frankly, go
into from time to time
6633.9 where the continuum of
interoception and dissociation
6636.51 is essentially flat,
6638.52 where you are a ball bearing
at one location or another,
6641.46 depending on whether or
not you're watching a movie
6643.59 that you're very engrossed in
6644.97 or you're in a conversation with
6646.44 or in an activity with your
partner or a friend, et cetera,
6648.63 that has you very engrossed,
6650.34 maybe matching their state, right?
6652.2 There are a number of
states you can imagine
6653.31 where matching one's state
is actually healthy and good,
6656.25 and then there are a number
of conditions in life
6658.05 and situations in life
6658.92 where being matched to
someone else's condition
6660.75 like you're getting yelled at
6661.77 and they're angry so then
you're getting angry,
6663.39 and then pretty soon,
6664.47 you know, you're not in the
best place along that continuum.
6668.58 And I think that for many people,
6669.99 they find themselves somewhere
along that continuum.
6672.66 And a number of practices,
including meditation,
6676.95 including exercise, including
getting a good night's sleep,
6680.01 including therapy, including journaling,
6683.25 including just doing activities
6684.81 like social engagement that you enjoy,
6686.43 are designed to sort of bring up the edges
6688.83 of that flat continuum into
more of a U or concave shape
6692.67 so that that ball bearing,
6693.84 meaning your state of awareness
6697.56 and your state of
feeling your own feelings
6699.57 versus paying attention to
what's going on around you,
6701.97 is somewhere, again,
biased toward the middle.
6704.73 By curling up the edges of
that continuum on either end,
6707.85 it biases that state toward the middle.
6711.03 And then, of course, there's the extreme
6713.19 that I think almost everybody would agree
6715.11 is more or less pathologic,
6717.3 which is one in which that continuum
6719.91 is no longer shaped like
a deep trench like a V,
6724.29 it's not shaped like a U,
6725.91 it's not flat with the
edges curled up a little bit
6728.22 or even flat.
6729.053 It's actually now convex.
6730.98 It looks like a mountain shape, a peak,
6733.17 and that little ball bearing at the top
6734.85 can either drop all the way to one side
6737.61 of pure interoception,
6739.29 just feeling beyond any ability
6741.93 to pay attention to anything else,
6743.43 just feeling one's feelings,
6745.35 being angry, being sad,
or even happy, right?
6749.07 Being so extremely happy or manic
6751.59 that you can't pay attention to the fact
6752.94 that it's totally out of context, right,
6754.89 inappropriate for what's
going on around you,
6756.45 or dropping to the other
side of the continuum
6759.06 where you're so dissociated
6760.71 that you're not engaged with
what's going around you.
6762.6 You're truly, quote, unquote, checked out.
6766.41 That shape is one that I
think almost all clinicians,
6771.12 if not all clinicians,
6772.41 and most people would say is pathologic
6774.6 because you are either
completely checked out
6777.99 or you are completely
absorbed in what's going on
6782.49 within you or around you.
6785.34 That mental model that I just created
6788.28 is a simple mental model.
6789.54 It is by no means exhaustive,
6791.61 but it does incorporate a
lot of what we think about
6793.86 when we think about mental health
6795.72 and we talk about the ability
to be mentally stable,
6798.66 to feel one's feelings,
6799.83 but to still be actively engaged
6801.66 in what's happening around us.
6803.07 And again, it's a continuum
6804.81 that spans from interoceptive
awareness to dissociation
6808.65 where the extremes are pathologic
6811.83 and somewhere in the middle is healthier,
6813.48 and then there are practices that bias us
6816.84 toward being in the middle by default.
6819.03 What are those practices?
6820.14 Well, we know for sure
6822.42 that being sleep deprived, for instance,
6825.06 tends to take us away
from that trench shape
6829.32 or U-shape continuum
or even flat continuum
6832.47 and starts to make that
continuum more convex.
6834.99 It tends to make us either feel
6836.73 like we're completely
checked out and exhausted
6839.34 or that we are completely labile,
6841.83 we are yanked around by whatever
experience is happening,
6845.01 we are just not able to manage.
6846.54 So sleep is, as I always say,
6848.76 the fundamental or foundational layer
6850.86 of mental health, physical
health, and performance
6852.69 because it tends to put
us in a healthier place.
6855.3 That is, when we're getting
6856.29 enough quality sleep consistently,
6858.45 it tends to put us in the
middle of that continuum.
6861.0 Sleep deprivation does
exactly the opposite.
6863.4 It pulls us apart.
6864.51 And when I say pulls us
apart, that's not a real term.
6866.67 What it does is it tends
to make that continuum
6869.79 less concave, right, less bowl shaped,
6872.52 and more convex, more hill shaped,
6876.57 if not a peak mountain shape
6879.36 where it drops us to
one side or the other.
6882.54 In addition, a meditative
practice done regularly,
6887.22 because it can allow us to
become more interoceptively aware
6891.54 or it can allow us to become
more exteroceptively aware,
6895.44 which is really just another
form of dissociation,
6898.95 again, dissociation isn't always bad
6901.23 provided it's not at the extreme,
6903.0 a meditative practice
can actually teach us
6906.57 to deliberately move along this continuum.
6910.98 So this is something, again,
6912.69 that hasn't been discussed a
whole lot in the literature.
6915.21 It's been discussed, I should say,
6916.41 in pieces in different literatures.
6918.51 If you look in the clinical
psychiatry literature,
6921.24 there's a wonderful collection
of studies and reviews
6923.88 that will say that interoceptive
awareness is terrific
6926.79 except for the person
6928.17 that is so aware of their
internal functioning
6930.18 that they are not able
to engage in the world.
6932.37 Similarly, you'll find
a beautiful literature,
6935.07 research and clinical literature,
6936.3 that will say that
dissociation is terrible
6939.6 in the case of trauma.
6940.98 In fact, it can put people in positions
6942.66 of repeating a behavior over and over
6944.58 that's damaging to them,
6946.41 but because they can disengage
6948.15 or they're dissociated from it
6950.16 that they continue the behavior,
6952.44 or dissociation can be very
adaptive and beneficial
6956.88 if it allows people,
6958.14 for instance, to create
some narrative distancing
6960.03 so they're not getting
pulled into every argument,
6961.95 or if someone screams at them,
6963.57 they don't necessarily
think that it's their fault.
6966.0 They are able to say, "Hey, wait,"
6967.5 you know, use their
prefrontal cortex and say,
6968.857 "Hey, wait, like, just
because you're upset
6971.16 does not mean that I did something wrong.
6973.08 Let's look at the evidence
rationally." Okay?
6976.59 So in thinking about the positive effects
6980.04 of meditation on mood,
6981.99 there are two aspects that are important.
6983.91 The first one we talked about earlier,
6985.29 which is being present to one's experience
6988.62 correlates with increased happiness.
6992.25 Having your mind wander,
6993.78 having your default mode
network be one of mind wandering
6997.62 actually is correlated
with being more unhappy.
7001.22 That was the earlier study
that we talked about,
7003.74 that study published in "Science."
7005.87 Now, of course, meditation
can make us more present,
7008.69 but if we do not pay attention
7010.67 to whether or not we are
becoming more present
7012.68 to interoception or exteroception,
7015.95 that is, to interoception or dissociation,
7019.25 and we don't pay attention
to whether or not our bias
7022.07 is one of dissociation
versus interoception,
7024.89 we don't know where we
are on the continuum,
7027.56 well, then the meditation
7028.64 actually can make things
worse, not better.
7033.2 In other words, if you're somebody
7034.22 who has a tremendous amount
of interoceptive awareness,
7037.79 well, then meditating
on your internal state
7040.19 may not be good,
7041.12 and actually, there's some evidence
7042.11 that it may actually be bad.
7044.39 I'll give you one little tiny example.
7046.07 I've talked about this
previously on the podcast,
7048.14 but in that very study
from Wendy Suzuki's lab
7050.3 showing that 13-minute-a-day meditation
7052.1 is beneficial for focus, mood, et cetera,
7054.8 it's also very clear that
for a number of people
7056.9 that do that typical third eye meditation
7060.17 for 13 minutes a day,
7061.49 if they do that too close to sleep
7063.35 or when they want to go to sleep,
7064.61 they have a hard time falling asleep,
7066.35 which makes perfect sense
7067.28 because they are becoming
more interoceptively aware,
7069.71 they are ramping up their level of focus.
7071.48 A meditation practice
7072.98 typically is a focus and refocus practice,
7075.98 and falling asleep involves
7077.42 turning off your thoughts and your focus
7079.79 and focusing purely on sensation,
7082.37 and then your thoughts kind of fragment
7083.99 and you drift off to sleep.
7085.31 This is why I'm a big fan
7086.27 of using non-sleep deep
rest or yoga nidra.
7089.17 We will provide links
to non-sleep deep rest
7091.4 and yoga nidra protocols.
7092.42 I've talked about them
on the podcast before,
7094.67 but those protocols are
not meditation per se.
7098.24 They tend to have people defocus,
7102.53 they are anti-focus practices,
7104.45 whereas meditation tends
to be a focusing practice.
7107.69 Along those lines, a meditation practice
7110.63 that is one that is
exteroceptively biased,
7113.84 where you focus on things
that are outside your body,
7117.32 can be wonderful for somebody
7118.76 who tends to focus too much
on their inner landscape
7121.16 and their inner narrative, et cetera,
7122.39 it can help get them out
of their head and body,
7125.0 which can be very beneficial.
7126.8 But for people that are not
in touch with their emotions,
7129.11 aren't in touch with how they feel,
7130.34 it actually can drive
them down the exact path
7132.77 that's wrong for them.
7134.3 So today's discussion is about meditation,
7136.28 and we want to make sure
7137.15 that we are parsing
meditation in a rational way
7139.76 that matches the neural circuitry involved
7143.72 and, more importantly, for
sake of practical purposes,
7147.17 that you are asking
yourselves the right question.
7149.75 Are you interoceptively
or exteroceptively biased?
7152.3 Do you tend to dissociate,
7153.38 or do you tend to sort of feel everything
7157.19 in a big way, right?
7158.72 I've heard this term of, you
know, hypersensitive people
7160.73 or things that sort,
7161.563 and, you know, some of
those are clinical terms,
7163.16 some of them are not.
7164.15 But you need to assess this,
7165.17 and you also need to assess
7166.16 where you happen to be at on a given day,
7168.68 which will be dictated, of
course, by how well you slept,
7171.5 life experience, et cetera.
7173.39 So this interoceptive-to-dissociative
continuum
7176.15 is one that you need to address
7178.4 prior to any meditative practice.
7180.86 And, again, the solution
or the answer of what to do
7184.88 in response to your answer
7187.79 of whether or not you
are more inward focused
7190.01 or outward focused, again, is very simple.
7192.38 Just do the opposite of
where your bias lies.
7195.14 That is, if you're tilted
towards interoception,
7197.099 do an exteroceptive focused practice.
7199.46 If you are more dissociative and you're...
7202.52 That sounds sort of pejorative,
it sounds bad, right?
7205.52 But, again, if you are somebody
7206.78 who is more focused on
events outside your body
7209.24 and you want to gain more
interoceptive awareness
7212.09 and feeling state, if you will,
7214.25 well, then you want to do a practice
7216.44 that's third eye center
practice or breathing focused.
7219.17 One of the reasons that
many people meditate
7221.66 is that they've heard before
or they've experienced
7224.54 that meditation can replace sleep
7227.21 or can reduce one's overall sleep need.
7231.68 So that's an interesting set of questions,
7233.3 and it's one that I
dove into the literature
7235.46 to pursue an answer to,
7236.747 and I came up with an answer
7238.04 that was frankly a little bit
complicated on the face of it
7241.16 but boils down to some
very simple protocols
7243.26 that I think any and
all of us can leverage
7245.9 in order to sleep better
7247.7 and maybe even reduce
the total amount of sleep
7250.37 that we need,
7251.203 something that I think
most people would want.
7253.58 You know, I realize that we all
7255.95 probably should enjoy
sleeping, I certainly do,
7258.08 but that it's hard to get enough sleep,
7259.49 and wouldn't it be wonderful,
7260.51 for instance, to be able to
get by on a little less sleep
7263.36 and still feel alert and rested?
7266.84 First of all, I want to
point to the recent study,
7269.21 and, again, this is one
that I've raised a few times
7271.61 and we'll post a link to it,
7273.29 entitled Brief, daily meditation
enhances attention, memory,
7277.4 mood, and emotion regulation
in non-experienced meditators.
7280.79 This is the work, again, from Wendy Suzuki
7283.16 who was a guest on the
Huberman Lab podcast,
7286.01 who is now the Dean of Arts and Sciences
7289.07 at New York University
7290.33 and has run a laboratory focused
on memory for a long time,
7293.6 is a terrific neuroscientist
and researcher
7295.94 and teacher, et cetera,
7297.17 and was a terrific guest on the podcast.
7299.51 I keep returning to this paper
7300.65 because they used so many
measures, they were very thorough,
7304.1 and the results were really interesting.
7305.27 Again, this is the 13-minute-a-day
7307.4 guided meditation session.
7309.02 I should just mention that the
control group in this study
7312.71 listened to a podcast for 13 minutes
7314.69 that did not improve
attention, memory, mood,
7319.22 emotion regulation, et cetera,
as much as meditation did,
7323.27 which is not to say that
podcasts aren't useful.
7325.55 I won't mention which podcast they used.
7327.32 Fortunately, it was not
the Huberman Lab podcast,
7329.96 which I like to think at
least increases understanding
7332.48 of certain key concepts of
science and science-based tools.
7335.99 You're welcome to look at the paper
7336.95 and see which podcast they used.
7338.45 It's a quite well-known podcast,
7341.15 which is an interesting podcast,
7342.44 but it didn't change the
brain in any fundamental way
7345.17 in this 13-minute session,
7346.28 whereas 13 minutes of
daily meditation did.
7348.68 And, again, something I mentioned earlier
7350.48 but very important to reemphasize now
7352.73 is that they mentioned
7354.08 that if people in the experiment
7358.7 meditated too close to bedtime,
7360.68 they had trouble sleeping,
again, which makes sense
7362.66 because meditation, at least
in its most common form,
7365.21 in the form used in this paper,
7366.29 is a focusing and refocusing exercise.
7368.9 Falling asleep involves focusing less.
7371.57 There are other studies, however,
7373.82 that have shown, or that asserted, rather,
7376.49 that doing two 20-minute
sessions per day of meditation
7381.17 can reduce the need for sleep.
7384.5 Those results are debated.
7386.6 First of all, understanding
what sleep need is
7390.2 is very individual,
7391.79 and determining what people can manage on,
7394.67 meaning some people can manage to get by
7397.97 with six hours of sleep but
would do better with eight,
7400.61 some people would actually
manage probably better
7403.85 in terms of focusing and alertness
7405.2 if they slept a little bit less
7406.34 because they might be waking up
7407.51 midway through a sleep cycle.
7408.95 If you want to learn more about this,
7410.45 you can check out any one
of three different episodes
7413.27 that we've done.
7414.103 One is Master Your Sleep.
7415.7 You can find that at hubermanlab.com.
7417.2 Everything is timestamped in that episode.
7418.97 The other is Perfect Your Sleep.
7420.65 And then, of course, we've
done episodes on sleep
7422.63 with expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley.
7425.84 All of those can be found at
hubermanlab.com in all formats,
7428.63 they're all timestamped.
7430.16 With that said, this
assertion that has been made
7433.64 many times over and certainly
in the popular press
7435.71 that regular meditation can
reduce one's overall sleep need
7439.55 is controversial for the following reason.
7442.52 Some groups find that
indeed that is the case,
7445.31 and the interpretation is
that the stress reduction
7448.34 that's brought about by
regular meditative practice,
7451.76 and in this case, very regular,
7452.96 it tends to be one or, more
typically, two 20-minute-per-day
7456.74 meditation sessions.
7457.76 That's quite a lot, I
think, for most people.
7459.869 I mean, if you think about 40 minutes,
7461.24 isn't that much time overall,
7463.55 but very few people will
stick to that twice a day,
7466.19 20-minute meditation
practice very consistently.
7470.48 Well, the idea is that
the stress reduction,
7472.67 which is clear and not debated,
7475.58 brought about by that type
of meditation practice
7480.05 is good at offsetting some
of the cortisol increases
7483.32 associated with reduced sleep
7485.81 and leading people to be able to function
7488.78 cognitively and physically
better on reduced sleep
7492.5 than they would
7493.333 had they not been doing
the meditation practice.
7496.61 So the simple way of putting this
7497.95 is that if people meditate regularly,
7500.66 that's reducing stress.
7501.77 The reduction in stress
is reducing cortisol.
7504.59 Again, cortisol is healthy,
7505.73 but it should be restricted
to early part of the day.
7507.59 You don't want too many peaks in cortisol,
7509.03 especially not late in the day.
7511.52 By meditating, you get the healthy pattern
7513.47 of cortisol release,
7515.39 you sort of inoculate yourself somewhat
7517.61 against the unhealthy
pattern of cortisol release,
7520.43 and as a consequence,
7522.44 either the sleep that people get is deeper
7525.23 and/or the total amount of
sleep that they need is reduced.
7529.58 Now, a lot of people took that result
7531.47 and interpreted it as saying,
7532.85 well, if you can't sleep,
then you can just meditate.
7536.39 So one night, you don't sleep
or you have trouble sleeping,
7538.55 you just meditate the next
day and you'll be fine.
7541.37 Well, certainly that is not
supported by the literature.
7543.44 However, there is a practice,
7545.72 and, again, it's one
that I've talked about
7547.04 on this podcast many times before,
7548.54 but if you haven't heard me talk about it,
7549.74 there's a practice called yoga nidra,
7551.21 which literally means yoga sleep.
7553.07 It is a practice of doing not
so much a focused meditation,
7556.4 but more of a body scan
7557.54 focusing on the sensation of the body
7559.19 and actually trying to turn
off that prefrontal cortex
7562.31 or reduce its activity.
7564.29 Yoga nidra scripts can be
found on YouTube and elsewhere.
7567.26 They are paralleled by a similar practice
7569.24 that I've talked a lot about
7570.2 called NSDR, or non-sleep deep rest.
7573.17 I put one out into the world,
7574.31 a short one that's 10 minutes long.
7575.9 You can just simply go to YouTube
7577.16 and put in NSDR and my
last name, Huberman,
7579.38 and there's one there.
7580.213 Again, all of this is
completely zero-cost.
7582.11 Yoga nidra and NSDR have been shown
7585.98 in a fair number of studies,
7587.72 not as many as been done
on traditional meditation,
7590.27 or I should say third
eye centered meditation
7592.7 or mindfulness meditation,
7594.41 but have been shown to replenish levels
7596.6 of certain neuromodulators like dopamine
7598.67 and reduce cortisol,
reduce a stress hormone
7601.7 at least as much and, by
my read of the literature,
7605.12 significantly more than
with traditional meditation.
7608.45 And there's a nice paper
7609.5 that we will provide a
link to which is entitled
7612.02 Yoga nidra practice shows
improvement in sleep
7614.18 in patients with chronic insomnia:
7616.19 A randomized control trial.
7619.25 Basically, this study looks
at, as the title suggests,
7623.15 people with chronic insomnia,
7624.92 although the results certainly carry over
7627.05 or would carry over for people
who don't have insomnia.
7629.57 The key result, I believe, in this paper,
7632.99 although there are many, is that, quote,
7635.457 "Salivary cortisol reduced
statistically significantly
7638.18 after yoga nidra."
7639.53 What do I mean by that?
7640.7 There was a statistically
significant reduction
7643.19 in cortisol levels, the stress hormone,
7645.56 immediately after the yoga nidra practice
7649.58 that we believe would be paralleled
7651.05 by a very similar if not
equivalent practice of NSDR.
7654.32 NSDR is a lot like yoga nidra
7656.45 but removes a lot of the kind of,
7659.21 let's just call it the
sort of mystical language
7660.77 and the intentions.
7661.603 It focuses more on the
physiology and the body scans.
7665.27 You know, I want to
acknowledge that yoga nidra
7666.95 has been around for thousands of years
7668.75 and was certainly there before NSDR.
7670.91 I also want to acknowledge that,
7672.167 and this was brought up
also in "Altered Traits,"
7675.2 that sometimes language can be a barrier
7677.48 toward people embracing practices.
7679.28 In fact, this was
recognized by Jon Kabat-Zinn
7683.03 when he created what he called
7686.06 mindfulness-based stress
reduction practices, or MBSR,
7690.89 which was simply mindfulness
meditation to reduce stress,
7693.35 but he called it MBSR,
mindfulness-based stress reduction,
7697.85 as a way to bring it into the clinics
7699.77 that would otherwise perhaps be averse
7701.27 to something called
mindfulness meditation.
7702.95 Again, this gets more to the sociology
7704.69 and the cultural aspects
7706.31 than it does to any specific utility
7709.01 of one practice versus another.
7711.32 Here's the takeaway point.
7712.37 If you want to get better at
falling and staying asleep
7714.8 or falling back asleep
7715.82 if you wake up in the middle of the night
7718.34 or if you are generally
challenged with sleep issues,
7721.73 an excellent behavioral practice
7723.14 for which there are terrific data,
7725.18 meaning data that show that
a stress hormone, cortisol,
7729.86 can be significantly reduced
7731.09 as well as certain
neurotransmitters can be replenished
7734.9 as well as, and this is key
and covered in this paper
7737.75 that I've mentioned a few
moments ago on yoga nidra,
7740.9 that the total amount
of sleep that you need
7742.91 can be reduced, at least somewhat,
7745.28 well, then yoga nidra or an NSDR practice
7747.92 done, frankly, any time of
day is going to be beneficial.
7752.93 Whereas if your goal, I believe,
7754.76 is to increase your ability to
focus, to improve your mood,
7758.81 and, perhaps most importantly,
7761.0 to be able to maneuver
yourself in a deliberate way
7763.79 along that interoceptive-exteroceptive
7766.85 or interoceptive-dissociative continuum
7769.22 that we've talked about so much,
7770.66 and to really shift your
default mode network
7772.88 from one of being a mind wanderer
7775.67 to somebody who can focus
and who frankly is happier,
7779.0 well, then a more traditional
7780.29 third eye center type meditation
7782.81 or a more traditional
exteroceptive-focused meditation
7787.01 would be beneficial.
7788.27 Again, which one of those you
choose, either focusing inward
7790.91 or focusing on a point outside of you,
7793.4 again, should be dictated
7794.33 by whether or not you tend
to be interoceptively biased
7796.82 or exteroceptively biased.
7798.38 But if you want to get better at sleeping,
7800.57 you want to get better at falling asleep,
7802.49 and you want to replace
sleep that you've lost,
7804.83 I put that in quotes
7806.06 so that my colleagues like Matthew Walker
7808.67 don't come after me with...
7810.41 What would you come after me with, Matt?
7812.51 Probably with an alarm clock
7813.65 and, I don't know, blankets and a pillow
7816.23 or something of that sort.
7818.09 In all seriousness,
7820.85 it's very clear that replacing
sleep that we've lost
7823.52 is an area of research that's
still active and ongoing,
7826.19 but NSDR and yoga nidra
are very promising,
7828.74 if not downright useful,
7832.55 for replacing sleep that you've lost.
7834.2 Certainly the small amount
of data that exists now
7836.9 point to the fact that they are,
7838.43 not the least of which
is a beautiful study
7840.02 published out of Scandinavia
7841.76 showing that a 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice
7845.57 can replenish levels of dopamine,
7848.18 which puts people in a position
7850.52 to be more action-oriented
and focused, et cetera,
7852.92 when they come out of the yoga nidra,
7854.15 so certainly a very useful practice.
7856.31 It's a form of meditation, we
could call it meditation-ish,
7859.88 but yoga nidra and NSDR
7861.317 are not typically what people think about
7863.42 when we talk about meditation.
7864.56 Of course, this is an
episode about meditation.
7866.36 The reason I bring up yoga nidra and NSDR
7868.06 is that many people meditate
to enhance their sleep ability
7871.307 and to reduce their total
amount of sleep need.
7874.4 It appears that meditation is
probably not ideal for that
7877.19 in comparison to yoga nidra and NSDR,
7879.14 but meditation is
excellent, if not superb,
7882.5 for adjusting the default mode network
7884.36 toward more happiness by
being more mindful and present
7886.97 and for placing oneself
in that healthy model
7890.48 of interoceptive-dissociative continuum.
7893.54 So we've covered a lot of information,
7895.34 and I like to think that I've given you
7896.93 some key decisions to make
7899.0 in developing a meditative practice.
7901.4 The most important one, of course,
7902.45 being what will you do regularly?
7904.7 And maybe you're somebody who
just answers that question
7906.56 by saying, "Look, I'm not
going to meditate regularly.
7908.57 I just want to do the thing
7909.8 that's going to allow me to
feel rested when I'm tired
7912.2 and is going to allow me
to adjust my state of mind
7915.65 when I'm not where I want
to be for whatever reason,
7918.47 too anxious or too exhausted, et cetera."
7920.51 And for those people,
7921.343 I would say a practice
like NSDR or yoga nidra
7924.14 will be immensely beneficial,
7925.76 as will a more traditional
form of meditation.
7928.97 I also want to just remind everybody
7931.07 that an app that guides meditation,
7933.77 also with some information
and some intention setting,
7937.37 such as the Waking Up app from Sam Harris
7939.83 can be immensely beneficial.
7941.66 I've certainly found it to be beneficial.
7943.07 I know millions of other
people have as well,
7945.35 so I encourage you to check that out.
7948.26 We've talked about
determining where you are
7950.48 on these continuums of
interoception and exteroception
7954.32 in order to dictate what particular type
7957.05 of meditation practice you
should do in a given moment,
7959.54 whether or not you
should focus your vision
7961.67 inward with eyes closed
7962.81 or focus your vision and
your attention outward
7965.06 being a key component,
7966.02 whether or not you should
do cyclic breathing,
7968.87 which will allow your focus
to be off your breathing
7972.41 somewhat easier than if you
do non-cyclic breathing,
7974.78 if you're doubling up
on inhales or exhales,
7976.76 whether or not your breathing
is going to be natural or not.
7979.07 And, of course, you need to determine
7980.63 whether or not your meditation practice
7982.25 is designed to enhance your
level of focus or to relax you.
7985.19 I would say that if it's designed
7986.9 to enhance your level of focus,
7988.85 that doesn't necessarily mean
that it won't be relaxing.
7992.0 You could do slow cadence breathing
7993.077 and third eye meditation,
it could be very relaxing,
7995.69 and yet it's a focus and refocus practice,
7998.27 whereas something like yoga nidra and NSDR
8001.0 is going to be more along the lines
8003.16 of replenishing yourself,
replacing sleep that you've lost,
8006.97 or maybe even reducing your sleep need.
8010.48 On previous podcasts, I've
talked about hypnosis,
8013.03 and particularly the episode
with Dr. David Spiegel,
8015.01 our associate chair of psychiatry.
8016.63 I don't want to get into hypnosis now,
8018.04 but just understand that
hypnosis is distinct
8020.56 from breathwork, from
yoga nidra, from NSDR,
8022.897 and from meditation
8024.43 even though it includes
some of those components
8026.83 like focusing your attention,
8028.33 it involves actually directing
your visual attention
8030.49 outward then inward to
go into the hypnosis,
8033.19 it involves some breathing
of a particular kind,
8035.17 it involves a specific imagery, et cetera.
8037.72 But hypnosis is distinct because
hypnosis is really designed
8041.56 to fix or address a specific problem,
8045.13 whereas meditation, NSDR,
yoga nidra, et cetera,
8048.28 typically are not.
8049.96 They can help fix problems
8052.27 such as anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera,
8054.4 but they generally are not directed
8056.77 toward a particular line of thinking.
8058.51 They can be, but typically they are not.
8060.58 Whereas hypnosis almost always,
8062.65 especially in the clinical
context, not stage hypnosis,
8064.93 but the clinical context for
which there's a lot of research
8067.87 to show it can, for instance,
help with quitting smoking,
8070.9 literally a quadrupling
of the effectiveness
8074.05 for smoking cessation with
something like the Reveri app
8076.93 than if people just try and go cold turkey
8078.94 or for reducing insomnia
or for reducing pain
8083.05 or for any number of things,
including trauma, et cetera,
8085.24 hypnosis is really great at
dealing with specific issues
8089.29 and problems and tackling those.
8091.09 Meditation tends to be
focused on other things,
8093.49 no pun intended.
8094.72 I'm guessing some of you
8095.553 are probably wondering where to start
8097.75 or, if you're already an avid meditator,
8100.15 where to go with all this information.
8102.34 For that reason,
8103.173 I just wanted to offer you a
particular form of meditation
8106.3 that incorporates all of the features
8109.66 that I've talked about up until now
8112.48 in a single meditation practice,
8114.7 and it's a meditation practice
8117.4 that, for lack of a
better name, I called STB,
8119.89 or Space-Time Bridging.
8121.51 And the time component has to
do with a very simple fact,
8124.6 which is when we focus our attention,
8127.66 visual attention or otherwise,
8129.25 on things close to or within our body,
8131.56 we tend to be fine slicing time.
8133.63 You could sort of think of your breath
8135.28 as more or less the second hands
on your clock of existence,
8139.66 whereas when we tend to focus
on things far away from us,
8142.87 we tend to parse or carve
up time within bigger bins.
8147.7 If you've ever seen a
airplane flying at a distance,
8151.03 it looks like it's
moving very, very slowly.
8152.56 If you were right up
next to that airplane,
8154.0 it's probably going 500
or 600 miles an hour,
8155.65 it would go by very quickly.
8157.33 This is not a coincidence.
8158.8 Believe it or not, how
you slice the time domain
8163.18 of your life and your experience
8164.71 has everything to do with your vision,
8166.3 and the closer things are,
8168.22 the more finely you slice up time.
8170.23 The more closely your attention
is placed on yourself,
8172.48 the more closely you slice up time.
8174.76 If you focus your visual
attention very far
8177.22 or you think about the other side
8179.29 of the world, for instance,
and you envision that,
8181.51 well, then you're actually
slicing time more broadly.
8185.08 Hopefully that makes sense.
8186.19 Fine slicing would be like
slow motion, higher frame rate.
8189.85 Looking in the distance,
8190.75 you're actually taking bigger time bins.
8192.46 So even though things look like
they're moving more slowly,
8194.41 it's because your fidelity,
8196.09 your precision of measuring
time is actually not as good.
8199.813 It's as if you only have
the hours hand on the clock
8203.95 so it seems like it moves very slowly.
8205.51 Hopefully that makes sense to you.
8206.74 So there's a meditation practice
8207.583 that I call Space-Time Bridging
8209.35 that incorporates everything
that I've talked about today.
8211.78 It balances interoception
and exteroception,
8214.0 it balances interoception
and dissociation,
8216.4 and it crosses the various time domains
8221.11 that the brain can encompass using vision.
8224.2 And it's a very simple meditation,
8225.88 it's one that I've been doing for years,
8227.32 and it's one that we're
starting to do some research on,
8229.267 but I'm just going to share with you
8230.47 because I think it's actually quite fun
8233.23 and can be quite informative.
8234.88 In fact, people have told me
8236.23 that it can even lead to
some interesting insights
8238.51 both during the meditation
and outside the meditation.
8241.18 It's very simple, what you do,
8242.65 ideally you would do this
outside or at a window,
8245.11 but what you do is you
essentially close your eyes.
8247.81 I'm not going to do this now,
8248.643 I'm not going to close my
eyes and do the meditation,
8249.79 but I'll describe it.
8250.623 You close your eyes and
you focus your attention
8252.28 either on your third eye
center or your breathing,
8254.59 and you try and put 100% of
your perceptual awareness
8258.19 onto your breathing or
your third eye center
8260.83 for the duration of three breaths, okay?
8263.29 So you're 100% or trying to
be 100% in interoception.
8268.9 Then you open your eyes,
8270.43 you focus on the surface
of your body someplace.
8272.95 I find that holding out my
hand at sort of arm's distance
8276.1 and focusing on the palm of my hand
8278.14 and focusing there visually,
8279.67 so I'm splitting my attention
now between my hand,
8282.4 and I'm also going to pay
attention to my breath
8284.38 for the duration of three
full inhales and exhales
8287.8 while also focusing on my hand,
8290.2 so you're splitting
interoception and exteroception
8292.96 as best you can, about 50/50.
8295.42 Then you subsequently
look at some location
8299.71 in your immediate environment,
maybe 10, 15 feet away,
8303.43 and you focus your
attention on that location
8306.13 while also splitting your attention
8307.75 so that you're still paying
attention to your breathing,
8309.25 you do that for the
duration of three breaths,
8311.56 but now you are in
exteroception and interoception.
8315.34 Then you focus your attention
at some distance further away,
8318.58 maybe the furthest distance you can see.
8320.17 Now, this is why it's
useful to do out of a window
8322.75 or on a balcony or outdoors.
8325.84 You focus on the furthest
point, maybe a horizon,
8328.18 some furthest point for the
duration of three breaths
8330.88 while also paying attention
to your breathing,
8333.34 and sort of imagine a
bridge between the two
8335.02 if you find it to be
challenging to focus on both.
8338.29 And then, and this is where
it can be a little tricky,
8340.6 but then what you actually
focus on is the fact,
8343.21 and this is not an imaginary thing,
8344.65 this is a fact that you are a tiny spec
8347.05 on this big ball that's
floating out in space, right?
8350.26 The Earth that's floating out in space.
8351.85 And you try and focus
on your three breaths
8354.25 while also acknowledging
8355.3 that you are a small body, literally,
8357.91 on this very seemingly
large body, the Earth,
8360.61 but that's floating in
a much larger, larger,
8363.28 expansive place, the universe,
8367.51 and you do that for three breaths.
8369.55 And then you close your eyes
8370.78 and you go right back into interoception,
8373.773 and you do that for three breaths.
8375.04 You focus on your interoception
for three breaths.
8377.41 And you might want to march
through these different locations
8379.63 a few times or back and forth if you like,
8381.37 but typically, I will
just do it for one segment
8384.7 at pure interoception,
8387.25 palm of hand, some distance
in front of me, horizon,
8391.66 whole globe, universe thing,
back into body, et cetera.
8395.2 Why is this useful? Why
would this be useful?
8398.2 Is it at all interesting, or
is this just some crazy idea?
8401.08 Well, the reason it's useful, I believe,
8404.23 is that it has you deliberately
step your awareness,
8408.94 your perception through every position
8412.09 along that
interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.
8416.14 Now, I did say to remain connected to,
8419.2 as they'll say in the yoga classes,
8420.88 aware of, I guess would be
8422.5 the more scientific way to state it,
8424.6 aware of one's breath,
8425.65 but if you wanted,
8426.483 you could actually try
and put your awareness
8428.41 completely outside yourself,
8429.67 but most people will find
that challenging to do
8431.53 if they're already paying
attention to their breath.
8433.33 It's just hard to do,
8434.23 so I find it easier to
just split my awareness
8436.69 from interoception to exteroception.
8439.0 But by stepping through
these different locations
8441.46 and then deliberately
placing your perception,
8445.45 your awareness back
into pure interoception,
8448.39 what you do is you essentially
are practicing or exercising
8452.74 this incredible ability
that the human mind has
8455.89 to deliberately place your
perception at specific locations
8459.91 along the interoceptive-exteroceptive
continuum.
8463.27 And I think this is very useful
8464.68 because many of us, including myself,
8466.54 tend to get locked at one
location along that continuum.
8469.51 For instance, if you're
scrolling your phone
8470.95 for a long period of time,
8472.69 you may forget about
your bodily sensations,
8474.37 but you generally forget
about other things
8476.02 going on in the world.
8477.28 Or if you're very focused
on things out in the world,
8479.14 you oftentimes can forget
about your internal sensations
8481.84 and what's going on internally.
8484.03 And being functional in work,
in life, in relationship,
8487.12 and in all aspects, including
your ability to fall asleep,
8490.96 involves stepping yourself
along these different locations,
8493.69 which, again, are not
just physical locations
8496.33 of third eye center or your breathing
8498.43 or your hand or horizon.
8500.26 Those are just stations within space.
8503.11 But remember, each one of those,
8505.33 just by way of how your visual
system and the time domain
8509.05 are interlocked with one another,
8511.78 sets your mind in a
particular time domain.
8514.36 And so much of what involves
being a functional human being
8518.08 involves dynamically
adjusting our attention
8521.44 from what we are doing on our computer
8523.18 to a question somebody
asks and then back again,
8525.52 or from text messaging
8527.23 to listening to a lecture or a podcast
8530.38 or from listening to a lecture or podcast
8532.69 and then going back into
a mode of commuting,
8535.24 but making that commute either relaxing
8537.31 or maybe do work on your commute
8538.69 or connect with family
or friends, et cetera.
8541.03 So much of the fatigue of life
8543.82 and the, I should say,
the maladaptive behaviors
8547.9 and emotions that show up in life
8549.73 are really not about any
set of behaviors or emotions
8553.9 being wrong or right,
8556.27 but rather inappropriately matched
8558.28 to the space-time domain that we're in,
8559.99 which, again, is just fancy nerd speak
8561.58 for saying being present and being mindful
8565.21 is a wonderful byproduct
of a meditation practice,
8569.32 but it is but one of those stations
8572.08 along that space-time continuum.
8574.9 The key element here is to step yourself
8577.3 through a practice deliberately
8578.44 so that you are flexibly
and dynamically able
8581.53 to engage in conversation,
then disengage and focus,
8584.53 or focus and then disengage
from the work you're focusing on
8587.2 and actually have a
conversation or be in the world
8590.11 and move out of that
interoceptive awareness
8592.9 to one in which you
are dynamically engaged
8595.63 with the things around you.
8597.55 I realize this might
sound a little bit vague.
8599.5 For that reason,
8600.333 I encourage you not to
think about it too much,
8602.77 but rather to try the practice,
see if it works for you.
8605.5 If it doesn't, that's fine.
8607.66 I think it is a good one for people
8609.07 that find that a third eye center
8612.07 or breathing-focused
interoceptive meditation
8615.1 might be enjoyable to them
or very beneficial to them,
8617.71 but they might want to try something new,
8619.18 and other people who might find
8620.32 that that tends to put them
too much in their own head.
8623.05 I think it also ought to
be very useful for people
8625.75 that tend to be overly exteroceptive,
8628.54 more on the dissociative
end of the continuum,
8630.79 and need to bring in a bit more
of interoceptive awareness,
8634.33 but either can't do that or
are uncomfortable doing that
8637.87 because they're simply not interested in
8639.82 or comfortable with feeling so
much of their internal state
8642.73 because that can either be overwhelming
8644.17 or that's just simply not
the way they want to feel.
8646.3 Now, as we round up, I
do want to acknowledge
8648.49 that there are an enormous
number of rooms within the house,
8653.47 or rather, I should say,
8654.37 within the castle that is meditation,
8656.8 including, for instance,
intention setting and mantras
8660.49 and an enormous number
of different features
8662.83 of meditation practices
8664.03 that we simply did not
have time to go into
8667.06 and/or for which the research on
8670.15 is not completely ironed out yet.
8672.453 And for that reason,
8673.93 in future episodes in not long from now,
8676.24 I'm going to be sitting down
with experts in meditation
8678.73 that include neuroscientists
and clinicians,
8680.71 but other experts in meditation
8682.84 that certainly are versed in those topics,
8685.39 and where they can't point
to specific research studies
8688.84 can certainly point us
toward the utility of things
8692.02 like mantras and intentions as they relate
8694.87 to getting the most out
of a meditative practice,
8696.88 so I eagerly await those conversations,
8699.04 and I hope you will join
me for those as well.
