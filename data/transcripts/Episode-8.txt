0.179 welcome to the huberman Lab podcast
1.92 where we discuss science and
3.959 science-based tools for everyday life
9.12 I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor
11.099 of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at
13.44 Stanford school of medicine today we are
15.599 discussing supplements or more
17.279 specifically a rational guide to
19.32 supplementation now to be forthright I
22.68 want to tell you that I am not a fan of
24.24 the word supplements because it stems
25.68 from this idea that all supplements are
27.72 somehow food supplements or designed to
30.48 compensate for what one could otherwise
32.34 get from food and that's simply not the
35.219 case many supplements are compounds that
38.16 are extremely efficacious for instance
40.559 for enhancing sleep or for enhancing
42.78 hormone function or for enhancing focus
45.18 and many of those compounds are simply
47.28 not found in food or are not found in
50.16 enough abundance in food to have the
52.26 desired effect
53.52 now that raises the issue as to whether
55.559 or not these compounds are good to take
57.84 safe to take and whether or not they are
59.879 actually beneficial for us and the short
61.86 answer is that like everything else
63.84 supplements can either be good for us or
65.64 dangerous for us depending on dosage
67.38 sourcing Etc but more importantly we
70.14 need to think about supplements and a
71.82 rational guide to supplementation as
73.86 taking into account a number of
75.18 different factors and we need to set
77.28 aside the idea that all non-prescription
79.5 compounds that fall under this umbrella
81.479 term supplements are simply things that
83.759 could be extracted from food but most
86.7 people don't either ingest enough of
89.04 those Foods or pay enough attention to
91.14 their diet in order to obtain them in
93.54 fact during today's episode I'm going to
95.34 give you a number of different very
96.78 specific questions that you can answer
98.34 in order to decide whether or not you
100.68 should be taking any so-called
102.18 supplements or not and whether or not
104.64 you should be taking one type of
105.9 supplement or another type of supplement
107.28 more or less than the other I'm also
109.439 going to discuss safety of course and I
111.96 will discuss cost because obviously
114.32 monetary cost is a serious consideration
116.88 for most if not everybody considering
118.979 the use of supplements during today's
120.54 episode I will also discuss which
122.04 specific supplements are optimal for
124.2 achieving specific endpoints such as
126.06 improved sleep such as improved focus
128.28 and such as improved hormone function
130.739 among other things I plan to cover the
133.26 full range of what I referred to as
134.7 supplements including so-called
136.56 foundational supplements that are
138.239 designed to act as a sort of insurance
140.22 policy against any deficiencies that
142.2 might exist within your diet all the way
144.3 up to very targeted outcome supplements
147.42 and compounds that is compounds that are
150.239 non-prescription that are designed to
151.86 achieve very specific endpoints such as
154.04 enhanced Focus over the next four to six
156.42 hours of physical work or mental work so
158.58 on and so forth
159.959 plan to cover everything in between that
161.519 as well and I promise to cover how
164.4 supplements interact with other things
165.959 such as behavioral tools prescription
167.64 drugs when supplements might be a good
170.28 alternative to prescription drugs when
171.9 they might not be a good alternative to
173.459 prescription drugs when supplements can
175.8 serve as an augment to already excellent
178.56 nutrition and prescription protocols and
182.22 every feature of supplements as it
184.08 relates to mental health physical health
185.519 and performance by the end of today's
187.14 episode you should be armed with a
189.06 number of different questions as I
190.56 mentioned before that will allow you to
192.42 develop the most biologically effective
194.7 and cost-effective supplement regimen
197.4 for you and of course I want to
199.739 acknowledge that for some people the
201.78 total amount or dosages of a given
203.7 supplement were supplements that you
205.319 might need to take could be zero there
207.659 are such individuals but that many
209.459 people can in fact arrive tremendous
211.319 benefit from supplements in a way that
212.879 can be more cost effective than trying
214.86 to obtain the same non-prescription
216.659 nutrients from food as we head into
218.819 today's conversation I want to emphasize
220.62 something very important not just as it
223.14 relates to supplements but as it relates
224.58 to all aspects of mental health physical
226.56 health and performance and that is I
229.2 take the stance that behavioral tools
231.299 that is specific actions that we take
233.64 and specific actions that we avoid form
236.459 the foundation of mental health physical
238.86 health and performance so things like
240.659 viewing morning sunlight and exercise
242.519 are behavioral tools they don't require
244.62 the ingestion of anything within the
247.019 realm of Behavioral tools there are also
248.64 some don'ts or do not that can greatly
251.519 enhance our mental health physical
252.9 health and performance such as avoiding
255.48 bright light exposure to your eyes
256.739 between the hours of 10 pm and 4 AM or
259.739 avoiding caffeine too late in the
261.78 afternoon because even if you can fall
263.34 asleep after ingesting caffeine in the
265.32 late afternoon we know it disrupts the
267.18 architecture of your sleep in ways that
268.68 greatly diminish your mental health
270.419 physical health and performance the
271.86 following day for instance so behavioral
274.259 tools form the foundational layer of all
277.68 tools for mental health physical health
279.12 and performance second to that I would
281.46 say the next layer is in fact nutrition
284.34 no amount of supplementation or
286.38 non-prescription compounds or
287.699 prescription compounds for that matter
289.08 can never compensate for poor nutrition
291.9 at least not for very long okay so this
294.36 is a key Point even though many
296.4 supplements are not simply food
298.199 supplements because they are not
300.12 designed to compensate for anything that
302.28 you could otherwise get from food that
304.259 is not to say that you can live on
306.0 supplements you know I suppose you could
307.62 live on whey protein and fish oil
309.74 capsules and vitamin capsules or tablets
313.199 for a short while but before long you'd
315.66 either suffer from boredom to the extent
318.66 that you'd want to go back to food or
320.1 some other deficiency would show up I
321.96 think it's the rare individual that
323.28 tries to survive entirely on food
326.1 supplements and things of that sort most
328.5 everybody and I would hope everybody is
330.66 paying attention to their nutrition so I
332.46 would Place behavioral tools do's and do
334.5 Nots as layer one the deepest layer the
337.56 Bedrock of all mental health physical
339.479 health and performance
340.979 on top of that I would Place nutrition
342.9 and of course that's going to mean
344.16 different things to different people
345.18 with the understanding that there's a
346.44 huge array of different food choices and
350.58 nutritional programs
352.199 nutrition is fundamentally important for
354.78 macronutrients for storage of energy in
357.36 the form of glycogen fats and
359.28 phosphocratine stores and so forth but
361.62 also for obtaining basic nutrients
363.96 vitamins minerals and micronutrients
365.759 Okay so we've got behavioral tools
367.44 nutritional tools then on top of that I
369.84 would place what is typically called
371.699 supplementation although today I'm
373.32 trying to expand that word to include
375.0 not just things that compensate for food
377.46 deficiencies or that are layered on top
379.62 of food as a way to enhance the amount
382.44 of nutrients that you could get from
383.819 food but as I mentioned before
385.8 compounds that are non-prescription that
388.56 can be for a variety of different
390.06 purposes and many of which are not
392.28 available in food so I would place
394.139 supplementation right on top of
395.759 nutrition then past that I would say
398.4 prescription drugs obviously prescribed
400.56 from a board-certified MD can serve a
404.58 very vital purpose in the treatment or
406.979 augmentation of mental health physical
408.479 health and performance goals so some
409.979 people do in fact need prescription
411.539 antidepressants other people do not some
413.28 people do in fact need prescription
415.74 drugs for attention deficit
417.419 hyperactivity disorder or sleep Related
419.22 Disorders so on and so forth
421.979 the whole issue of whether or not there
423.9 is an over prescription epidemic or not
427.86 um is a separate conversation for a
429.419 separate podcast I would argue that many
431.16 prescription drugs do in fact save lives
433.62 this includes the category of
435.3 prescription drugs related to statins
437.759 and cardiovascular health related to any
441.24 number of different things even sleep
442.74 disorders and insomnia narcolepsy and so
444.78 forth
445.86 that said there are many instances in
448.8 which people can either reduce their
450.36 dosages of prescription compounds or can
454.5 replace those prescription compounds
456.18 with quality behavioral tools nutrition
460.08 and supplementation but there are many
463.44 instances in which prescription drugs
465.66 are the only route by which people can
467.34 achieve the mental health physical
468.66 health and performance goals that they
470.34 wish to achieve so I would place that as
472.259 the fourth layer in this stack of layers
474.96 directed towards mental health physical
476.58 health and performance so just to list
478.56 off again I fundamentally believe that
480.96 behaviors do's and do Nots form the
483.12 foundation of mental health physical
484.199 health performance and next in line
486.12 would be nutrition
487.979 that is the specific Foods we eat the
491.099 amount that we eat the combinations of
493.62 foods that we eat in a given sitting and
495.539 the timing in which we eat our food then
497.94 on top of that I would Place
498.96 supplementation the topic of today's
500.52 episode and finally prescription drugs
503.22 and of course all of these things
504.84 interact in important and interesting
507.3 ways many of which interactions we will
509.58 discuss during today's podcast as we
511.56 drill into the topic of supplementation
513.719 developing a rational supplementation
515.76 protocol and one that is most
517.919 biologically and cost effective before
519.839 moving further into today's episode I
521.7 want to emphasize a very important point
523.2 which is that I am not a physician that
526.62 is I'm not a clinician so I do not
528.72 prescribe anything nor am I going to do
530.76 that today I'm a professor I review the
533.279 research literature I describe tools
535.68 gleaned from the research literature and
537.6 developed from the research literature
539.16 so I profess many things but I do not
541.44 prescribe anything and I think it's
543.36 vitally important that anytime you are
545.76 thinking of adding or subtracting any
548.519 behavioral protocols nutritional
550.56 protocols supplementation based
552.36 protocols and certainly prescription
553.92 drug based protocols
556.08 for whatever purpose that you consult a
558.899 trusted board-certified physician that's
561.6 absolutely essential I don't say that
563.399 merely to protect me I mainly say that
566.16 to protect you the most important aspect
568.74 of today's episode is not going to be
570.779 that you discover one particular
572.459 supplement or category of supplements or
574.38 blend of supplements that is going to
576.48 transform your mental health physical
577.86 health and performance
579.42 no the purpose of today's episode is for
582.24 you to understand where you have needs
585.06 that can be met by supplementation
586.68 better than any other approach and most
589.08 importantly how to think about
590.339 supplementation that is how to think
592.74 about the different categories of
594.06 supplements that are out there and how
596.339 those interact with your nutrition and
598.56 your behaviors so that you can maximize
601.56 your immediate and long-term health
604.2 what I mean by this is that we have this
607.38 word supplements or supplementation but
609.6 that means many many different things it
611.519 means vitamins it means minerals it
612.959 means adaptogens most people probably
614.82 don't even know what an adaptogen really
616.5 is and in fact many people talking about
619.08 adaptogens never actually Define what an
621.899 adaptogen is or designed for or the fact
624.779 that many adaptogens are also used for
626.88 other purposes so today's discussion is
629.459 really about you learning how to think
631.68 about supplementation the same way you
633.48 would learn to think about nutrition or
636.0 exercise or anything related to brain
638.519 and body health for that matter in a way
640.44 that lets you navigate this vast space
642.779 that we call supplementation and develop
645.54 protocols that are optimal for you and
647.76 indeed it may be the case that the ideal
650.64 dosage of a given supplement for you is
653.76 zero milligrams for instance if I ask
656.579 you are you sleeping deeply and enough
659.1 each night do you feel rested throughout
660.779 the day maybe you need a short nap and
662.16 that's it or maybe you don't and you say
664.2 yes I feel great I sleep great I wake up
666.839 feeling great I only need a short nap or
668.519 no nap during the day to feel rested
670.2 throughout the day well then there's
671.88 really no discussion about sleep
673.14 supplementation to be had between you
674.82 and me however
676.74 if you are not sleeping well then a big
679.079 discussion opens up as to what the
680.7 reasons are as it relate to nutrition or
682.38 when you're exercising or ingesting
684.18 caffeine in other words no discussion
686.1 about supplementation can be had in a
687.839 vacuum
688.92 rather discussions about supplementation
691.2 need to be considered in a larger
692.76 context so today you're going to learn
694.019 how to place the discussion and thinking
695.579 about supplementation in a larger
697.019 context and think about how specific
699.38 supplements that is specific ingredients
701.94 and combinations of ingredients can
704.88 indeed be used to buffer and support
707.22 your overall health and lead you to
709.98 specific health and performance outcomes
712.2 before we begin I'd like to emphasize
714.18 that this podcast is separate from my
715.98 teaching and research roles at Stanford
717.54 it is however part of my desire and
719.579 effort to bring zero cost to Consumer
721.56 information about science and science
723.0 related tools to the general public in
725.399 keeping with that theme I'd like to
727.079 thank the sponsors of today's podcast
728.64 our first sponsor is momentous momentous
731.88 makes supplements of the absolute
733.44 highest quality the huberman Lab podcast
735.6 has decided to partner with momentous
737.399 because of the extremely high quality of
739.44 momentous supplements and because they
741.54 have single ingredient formulations as
743.88 we'll discuss more on today's episode
745.2 single ingredient formulations are
747.3 essential for most all aspects effects
749.399 of developing a rational highly
751.44 efficacious supplement regimen and
753.66 that's because the ideal supplement
754.98 regimen allows you to adjust the dosages
757.5 of individual ingredients as well as
759.779 alternate days in which specific
761.579 ingredients are consumed it also allows
763.98 you for instance to assess whether or
765.54 not one given ingredient works for you
767.339 and another ingredient does not and it
769.44 also allows you to assess whether or not
770.88 any side effects originate from a
772.98 specific component of your supplement
775.2 protocol another advantage of momentous
777.24 supplements is that they ship anywhere
778.8 in the world because we realize that
780.18 many of you reside outside of the United
781.92 States if you'd like to try any of the
783.839 supplements mentioned in today's or
785.22 other episodes of The huberman Lab
786.48 podcast so for instance things related
788.279 to sleep augmentation hormone
789.779 augmentation enhancing Focus metabolic
792.12 health or otherwise you can go to live
794.16 momentous spelled ous so

798.6 20 off any of their products today's
801.06 episode is also brought To Us by element
802.74 element is an electrolyte drink that has
805.32 everything you need and nothing you
806.88 don't that means plenty of sodium
808.74 magnesium and potassium the so-called
810.779 electrolytes and no sugar getting
813.42 sufficient hydration and electrolytes is
815.7 key to brain health and body health and
818.04 that's because every cell in your brain
819.48 and body relies on having enough
821.339 electrolytes available in order to
823.139 function this is especially true of the
824.82 so-called neurons or nerve cells in your
826.56 brain they actually require sufficient
828.6 amounts of sodium and potassium and
831.06 magnesium but especially sodium and
832.62 potassium available to them in order to
834.959 fire what are called Action potentials
836.76 or electrical signals that's what allows
838.38 you to think to feel to move what gives
840.899 you energy so on and so forth so when
842.639 you are dehydrated oftentimes you will
844.68 need to get electrolytes and that's true
846.6 if you're exercising a lot or if you
848.22 sweat a lot but for many people it's
849.839 just true because they're not consuming
851.459 enough water and electrolytes in the
852.839 form of liquids and Foods throughout the
854.76 day element contains a science back

937.079 to 200 off and two free pillows let's
939.48 talk about supplements and
940.62 supplementation and how to develop a
942.779 rational supplementation regimen one of
945.48 the things that's really emerged over
946.92 the last 20 years is that supplements
949.26 and there I'm referring to
950.82 non-prescription compounds designed to
952.98 augment nutrition prescription drugs and
955.92 behavioral protocols
958.26 have emerged as a Mainstay within the
962.04 health and wellness but also the medical
964.44 communities that are focused on
966.06 developing mental health physical health
967.68 and performance for their patients and
969.959 their athletes and for the everyday
971.639 person essentially what I'm saying is
973.74 that 20 years ago a discussion about
976.079 supplements would mainly take place
977.82 within the niche communities of health
979.62 food stores or particular athletes but
982.86 nowadays I think almost everyone is
984.839 familiar with the fact that yes indeed
986.88 there are standard vitamin supplements
988.68 but that there are also supplements such
990.779 as Vitamin D3 which are designed to make
993.24 sure that people have certain amounts of
995.16 hormones in their bloodstream because
997.56 they might not be getting enough
998.519 Sunshine although I'll be very clear
1000.38 over and over throughout this episode
1001.699 that there is no pill replacement for
1004.1 Sunshine nor is there a pill replacement
1006.079 or food replacement for that matter for
1008.48 exercise or for social connection or for
1011.12 sleep or for simply getting smarter
1013.459 again there is no pill that's going to
1015.8 replace excellent behavioral protocols
1017.959 in fact a physician friend of mine has a
1019.94 great saying that I think everybody
1021.259 should keep in mind
1022.639 as we wade into this conversation which
1025.04 is that Better Living Through Chemistry
1027.079 still requires Better Living
1029.6 I think that's a very important phrase
1031.459 to keep in mind when thinking about the
1033.38 optimal supplementation or prescription
1035.12 drug protocol for you so what is an
1038.059 ideal supplementation protocol well I
1040.459 think what we need to do is to take a
1042.079 step back and ask what are different
1044.36 supplements designed to do for instance
1047.419 there are foundational supplements these
1050.0 are supplements that are designed to
1051.86 establish a foundation or provide
1053.72 Insurance along with your nutritional
1056.48 intake to ensure that you're getting all
1058.88 the things that you need in order to
1061.34 have a basic level of mental health
1063.2 physical health and opportunity for
1065.419 Optimal Performance now this is the one
1068.24 category of supplements for which I
1070.7 think it's appropriate and in fact
1073.76 advantageous to have multiple
1076.28 ingredients in a given supplement
1077.84 throughout the rest of today's
1079.16 discussion I'm going to talk about the
1081.08 advantage of mainly focusing on taking
1083.78 single ingredient formulations for a
1086.12 variety of reasons but when it comes to
1088.22 foundational supplements
1089.84 what we're mainly talking about are
1091.88 supplements that contain vitamins and
1094.22 minerals that are designed to compensate
1096.74 for any deficiencies you might have from
1098.84 diet or from lack of adequate diet how
1102.08 would such a lack of vitamin and mineral
1104.66 intake arise well for instance if you're
1107.059 somebody that practices intermittent
1108.679 fasting or other components of fasting
1110.96 or if you're somebody who does not get
1113.78 enough vitamins and minerals from
1116.0 vegetables and fruits and Grains and
1120.14 meats well then taking a supplement that
1123.26 can
1124.34 act as a insurance policy against any
1127.16 vitamin mineral deficiencies in many
1129.14 ways can be advantageous although I will
1131.059 talk about some of the safety concerns
1133.46 in just a few minutes now I want to
1135.38 acknowledge that as soon as we talk
1136.58 about vitamin mineral supplements the
1139.34 Skeptics immediately raise their hands
1140.96 and say well all that vitamin and
1142.94 mineral supplements do is give you very
1144.38 expensive urine and there the Skeptics
1146.539 are referring to the fact the reality
1148.64 that when you ingest high levels of
1151.16 water-soluble vitamins so think vitamin
1153.08 C and some of the other vitamins that
1155.059 indeed you will excrete them in your
1157.16 urine
1158.36 however
1160.4 it's also the case that many people are
1162.32 not getting enough of the water-soluble
1164.48 vitamins from their foods and it's also
1166.7 the case that many people are and it's
1168.919 also the case that ingesting higher than
1171.02 needed amounts of most water-soluble
1173.66 vitamins provided those levels aren't
1175.82 exceedingly High
1177.86 is or at least we should say can be safe
1180.86 and again this is provided that the
1183.38 levels that they're ingesting are not
1185.0 exceedingly high so the typical vitamin
1187.039 mineral supplement is indeed going to
1188.539 cover any gaps or deficiencies that
1190.76 might arise in the water-soluble
1192.2 vitamins from your food intake but the
1194.36 reality is that most people are getting
1196.58 enough of the water-soluble vitamins
1198.26 from their food if they are paying
1200.66 attention to a couple of things
1202.46 and those things are very simple to lay
1204.679 out regardless of whether or not you're
1206.66 a vegan a vegetarian a more traditional
1209.539 omnivore eating from both animal-based
1212.059 and plant-based sources grains Etc or
1214.88 even if you're in the pure carnivore or
1217.4 strict I guess it's called The Lion diet
1219.62 where it's just meat and salt regardless
1222.02 of what type of nutrition you follow you
1224.539 will get vitamins and minerals but
1226.52 you'll get more or fewer of them
1228.14 depending on the nutritional program you
1230.12 follow and of course depending on how
1232.46 often and how much you eat that's just
1234.02 sort of obvious
1236.12 most people who take a vitamin mineral
1238.46 supplement
1239.36 will indeed excrete a lot of the
1241.66 water-soluble vitamins they will retain
1244.58 the fat soluble vitamins and there again
1247.28 the Skeptics will raise their hands and
1248.78 say you do not want to take high levels
1251.36 of fat soluble vitamins because they
1252.86 will be stored in your system
1253.82 potentially to levels that are dangerous
1255.919 again provided that vitamin mineral
1258.2 supplements are not taken in excess it's
1260.96 unlikely that you're going to have such
1262.52 a buildup of the fat soluble vitamins in
1265.039 your system that they're going to be a
1266.6 problem so that raises a very specific
1268.76 question that you need to ask do you
1270.44 want to take a vitamin mineral
1271.58 supplement well the answer to that will
1273.26 be highly individual but you really just
1274.58 need to address two things first of all
1277.28 is the cost within the range that you
1279.559 can afford and want to pay right
1282.14 oftentimes these vitamin mineral
1283.76 supplements can be quite inexpensive but
1286.16 some of them can be quite expensive and
1288.14 you can see the full range of ones that
1290.9 are pennies per day all the way up to
1293.299 many dollars or tens of dollars per day
1295.52 because of what are reported to be
1297.74 variations in quality and sourcing and
1300.08 so forth I'm not aware of any real
1302.299 differences between the quality of the
1304.34 water soluble and fat soluble vitamins
1306.2 found in the less expensive versus the
1308.78 more expensive vitamin mineral
1310.159 supplements more typically the cost
1312.799 scales with the dosages of these
1315.679 different vitamins and minerals and as
1318.32 could probably be expected the more
1320.96 expensive to obtain and source
1324.98 vitamins and minerals tend to be in
1327.679 lower quantities in the less expensive
1329.78 versions of vitamin mineral supplements
1331.22 that's just kind of obvious so you need
1332.419 to ask yourself can you afford it
1333.98 financially and then you need to ask
1335.48 yourself are you able to regularly
1338.0 ingest enough foods with enough variety
1340.22 to cover your vitamin mineral
1343.1 needs just from food and for some people
1346.82 the answer is going to be an immediate
1348.44 yes they are careful to get enough of
1350.6 the foods that allow them to obtain
1352.58 their vitamin and mineral quota and for
1355.159 other individuals the answer will be no
1356.72 I would say for people that are
1358.46 extremely physically and or mentally
1360.32 active and for people that perhaps are
1363.02 following a intermittent fasting
1365.0 schedule so they are not ingesting a lot
1367.159 of food in general or restricting their
1369.679 food intake to specific times of day
1371.24 well then a vitamin mineral supplement
1373.22 likely makes sense for them however it's
1375.74 going to be very important to ingest
1377.12 that vitamin mineral supplement with
1378.98 food and ideally early in the day so
1381.799 that can set up a little bit of a
1382.88 challenge for the intermittent fasters
1384.26 who are restricting their feeding window
1385.58 to late in the day why do I say this
1387.02 well many of the water-soluble vitamins
1389.12 in particular the B vitamins need to be
1391.52 ingested with food because otherwise
1393.32 they can cause some stomach upset and
1395.419 again there's a range there some people
1396.799 like myself can take B vitamins on an
1398.539 empty stomach and feel fine other people
1400.28 feel really lousy when they take B
1401.78 vitamins there are a few other things
1403.159 that we'll talk about later namely zinc
1406.28 and coenzyme Q10 that really should also
1408.74 be taken with food but the best time to
1411.38 take a vitamin mineral supplement is
1412.94 with food and I believe that if you're
1415.4 going to take a vitamin mineral
1416.48 supplement
1418.1 that you want to take it with food and
1420.2 you don't want to take dosages of
1421.76 vitamins and minerals from supplements
1423.74 that are exceedingly high for a couple
1426.26 of reasons one is the buildup of fat
1428.059 soluble vitamins that we talked about
1429.38 before the other reason is that when
1431.36 people tend to take very high levels of
1433.4 vitamins and minerals from supplements
1436.34 they tend to spend less time and focus
1438.86 on making sure that they're optimizing
1440.539 their nutrition or at least trying to
1442.039 get their nutrition right what do I mean
1443.9 by getting their nutrition right well I
1446.539 think regardless of whether or not your
1448.46 keto omnivore carnivore
1451.159 vegan or any other nutritional plan
1455.72 the key thing is to get most that is
1459.14 about 75 to 80 of your Foods or more
1461.48 from non-processed or minimally
1464.36 processed sources I think there is
1466.28 agreement across the board that most
1468.32 people should avoid highly processed
1470.36 foods highly processed foods are going
1472.039 to be foods with very long ingredient
1474.32 lists that have very long shelf lives so
1477.14 this often includes snack foods it does
1479.72 include snack foods like chips Etc
1482.24 pastries that could sit on the Shelf a
1484.039 long time
1484.88 but it also includes things like canned
1486.98 soups and number of different other
1488.539 foods that have many many ingredients
1490.4 preservatives most people would do well
1492.02 to avoid those kinds of foods and focus
1493.82 most of their intake on things that are
1496.7 non-processed so these would be things
1498.38 like fruits and vegetables you'll notice
1499.64 that the non-processed foods will tend
1501.08 to have very short shelf life or require
1503.419 refrigeration in some cases such as meat
1505.88 eggs Etc
1507.2 or minimally processed foods such as you
1510.44 know rice and oatmeals and pastas beans
1512.6 and things of that sort beans oftentimes
1514.58 can be completely unprocessed as well of
1516.2 course these are two general categories
1517.64 unprocessed and minimally process that
1519.74 should make up about 80 or more of your
1522.08 food intake if your goal is health and
1523.88 obtaining adequate amounts of vitamins
1525.62 and minerals the so-called foundational
1527.24 supplements include of course vitamin
1529.1 and mineral supplements
1530.659 but has expanded over the last decade or
1533.659 more to also include supplements that
1536.0 have vitamins and minerals but also
1538.52 things like digestive enzymes and again
1541.1 here we have an example where indeed you
1543.62 can get digestive enzymes from foods for
1546.86 instance eating a bit of papaya or even
1548.96 a little bit of Pineapple can
1551.179 assist in the digestion of certain
1553.039 aspects of macronutrients because these
1555.08 are naturally occurring enzymes that
1557.299 help digest things like carbohydrates
1559.4 fats and proteins
1561.2 and there are other food-based sources
1563.12 of enzymes you're welcome to look those
1564.44 up online if you just put food based
1566.72 sources of enzymes and you'll find those
1568.159 but nowadays A lot of the foundational
1570.62 supplements will include
1573.74 papain or they will include different
1575.86 lipases or anytime you hear the word Ace
1578.96 by the way it means an enzyme an enzyme
1582.08 is designed to break down or to catalyze
1584.12 some sort of reaction in biology and
1586.52 nutrition in particular so you can find
1589.22 foundational supplements that include
1590.659 vitamins and minerals and digestive
1592.34 enzymes and nowadays more and more the
1595.279 quality foundational supplements are
1596.84 also including things like adaptogens
1598.94 and here the name adaptogens is sort of
1602.48 vague and it indeed has no specific
1605.48 operational definition this is something
1607.1 really important to understand about
1608.9 supplementation is that companies and
1611.6 indeed podcasts can talk about
1613.1 adaptogens without actually defining
1614.9 what an adaptogen is
1616.64 in an operational way when we say
1618.62 operational what we mean is a definition
1620.539 that everyone in a given Arena or space
1623.98 research for instance can agree on so
1626.779 that when we talk about the adaptogenic
1628.94 effects of a given compound we're all
1630.38 talking about the same things well
1631.58 foundational supplements nowadays
1633.2 include vitamins minerals digestive
1635.539 enzymes and the so-called adaptogens and
1637.52 the adaptogens broadly speaking are
1640.46 thought to improve the body and brain's
1642.559 ability ability to buffer against
1644.36 various stressors so these could be
1646.46 things like herbs like ashwagandha that
1648.74 are designed to reduce cortisol levels
1650.779 in that sense ashwagandha is an
1652.4 adaptogen but ashwagandha has other
1654.44 effects related to hormone augmentation
1656.9 in both the testosterone and estrogen
1658.82 and maybe even the thyroid Pathways
1660.2 we'll talk about this a little bit later
1661.159 when we talk about supplements for
1662.36 hormone augmentation so foundational
1664.4 supplements has really expanded to
1666.5 include a lot of different categories of
1668.659 nutrients and micronutrients vitamins
1670.82 and minerals digestive enzymes designed
1673.4 to achieve a broad spectrum of effects
1676.1 again this is the one category of
1678.38 supplementation where I think it makes
1679.82 sense to explore
1682.24 multi-ingredient formulations and the
1684.74 other thing that's often included in
1685.94 these so-called foundational supplements
1688.34 are probiotics or prebiotics
1692.0 which are designed to augment and
1695.0 support the so-called gut microbiome the
1697.4 gut microbiome is the collection of
1699.62 trillions of little micro bacteria that
1701.6 exist in all of us they mainly exist in
1705.44 the mucous membrane-lined tissues of the
1708.32 body so that would be your nasal
1710.24 passages your mouth
1711.98 the vagina the urethra and the gut the
1715.88 whole way from your mouth all the way
1717.559 out the other end so not just your
1719.24 stomach trillions of bacteria live there
1721.76 trillions of microbacteria also live on
1724.76 your skin in fact every time you shake
1726.559 someone's hand you're exchanging
1727.76 microbacteria
1729.2 these micro bacteria often are healthy
1731.96 for us good for us they support a huge
1734.419 number of positive biological functions
1736.34 but there are other microbacteria that
1739.159 live in our gut and Elsewhere on those
1741.02 mucous line tissues that can be
1742.84 disadvantageous for us that can harm our
1745.46 health a growing idea these days based
1747.74 on a number of different Laboratories
1749.36 work including the laboratory of my
1751.64 upstairs neighbor at Stanford Dr Justin
1754.1 Sonnenberg who's been a guest on this
1755.6 podcast is that having a great diversity
1758.12 a range of microbiota as they're called
1761.26 microbiome microbiota and these
1764.299 microbacteria are all essentially
1766.64 referring to the same thing the
1767.899 microbiome is the whole collection of
1769.34 these microbacteria but having a lot of
1771.38 different so-called species of these
1773.0 microbacteria is known to be
1775.34 advantageous for immune system function
1777.38 hormone function it supports the
1779.84 so-called gut brain axis that's
1781.94 important for a number of things
1783.5 including mood and motivation actually
1785.36 supports the production of
1786.44 neurotransmitters in the brain and body
1788.179 that can help keep you motivated
1789.799 elevated mood
1791.72 support the general function of neurons
1793.46 well not surprisingly there are ways to
1797.48 support the gut microbiome and there are
1799.34 ways to harm the gut microbiome I'll
1800.84 refer to to the podcast episode we did
1803.419 with Justin Sonnenberg you can find that
1805.52 at hubermanlab.com if you want to learn
1807.02 all the different ways you can support
1808.159 your gut microbiome but for sake of
1810.44 today's discussion I want to emphasize
1811.82 that some of those methods of supporting
1814.039 the gut microbiome are through the
1816.2 direct consumption of particular foods
1818.419 and there are two categories of foods
1820.22 that if you're getting enough of them
1822.26 it's likely that your gut microbiome is
1825.86 diverse and is going to support all
1827.96 those important functions I just listed
1829.46 off and other functions as well the two
1832.1 sources of gut microbiota supporting
1834.86 foods are low sugar fermented foods so
1837.559 these would be things like sauerkraut
1839.299 kimchi
1840.82 Greek yogurt again low sugar Greek
1843.62 yogurt
1844.76 um
1846.039 kombucha in particular as a drink things
1849.74 like kefir there are a bunch of other
1851.539 varieties of fermented foods different
1854.539 cultures have different fermented foods
1856.1 so Japanese natto is um another source
1859.22 of of ferment that is very good for the
1861.98 gut microbiome and work from Justin
1864.38 sonnenberg's lab and close by Labs at
1867.08 Stanford School of Medicine have shown
1868.76 that
1869.659 if people ingest
1871.52 four servings a day of these low sugar
1874.1 fermented foods it greatly improves the
1877.159 function of the gut microbiome and in
1878.96 particular enhances the function of the
1881.659 immune system and it reduces the
1883.279 so-called inflammatorium it reduces
1885.08 inflammation in the brain and body in
1886.52 the ways that are helpful and effective
1889.22 for brain and body that is mental health
1891.02 physical health and performance so there
1892.88 are ways to support your gut microbiome
1894.62 strictly from food but it should come as
1897.679 no surprise that most people are not
1899.659 ingesting four servings a day of
1902.84 fermented foods hopefully they're
1904.88 getting enough fiber
1906.74 especially Prebiotic fiber which is one
1909.559 other way to support the gut microbiome
1911.24 although the studies from Justin
1912.32 sonnenberg's lab point to the fact that
1914.48 fiber intake itself was not directly
1917.899 supportive of the gut microbiome in
1920.0 everybody it was in some individuals but
1922.22 not in others and some had no effect and
1924.5 in other individuals it actually made
1926.12 the
1927.32 category or I should say the array of
1930.02 inflammatory markers worse it actually
1932.299 led to more inflammation so that's not
1935.179 to say that fiber is bad in fact in the
1937.34 episode that we did with Dr Lane Norton
1939.26 he discussed the many benefits of
1941.36 getting enough fiber there are a lot of
1942.86 reasons why people should get enough
1944.779 fiber in their diet but at least for
1946.76 supporting the gut microbiome
1949.76 four servings a day of low sugar
1951.38 fermented foods
1952.82 seems to be the best way to support the
1955.34 gut microbiome through the intake of
1957.2 nutrition again most people are not
1959.36 achieving that and therefore these
1960.98 foundational supplements that can be
1963.799 just vitamin and mineral supplements or
1965.779 it could be vitamin and mineral
1966.74 supplements plus digestive enzymes or
1969.26 both of those things plus adaptogens now
1972.38 also tend to include prebiotics and
1975.14 probiotics that are designed to support
1977.539 the proliferation and maintenance of
1980.36 enough gut microbiota in order to
1982.94 support the gut microbiome and the gut
1985.399 brain axis now because of the importance
1987.5 of the gut microbiome and because most
1989.059 people are not getting enough support
1990.559 for the gut microbiome in the form of
1992.779 low sugar fermented foods and Prebiotic
1994.94 fiber from their diet
1996.86 I think perhaps one of the most
1999.38 essential foundational supplements
2003.399 irrespective of whether or not it
2005.08 includes vitamins and minerals
2006.279 adaptogens and digestive enzymes is some
2008.86 way to support the gut microbiome now
2011.679 this gets into a whole dimension of
2014.32 of categories of Prebiotic and probiotic
2016.96 capsules and one needs to be very
2018.46 careful there I do want to say that most
2020.919 of the Prebiotic and probiotic capsules
2023.679 that you can buy first of all are very
2025.6 expensive the best ones are going to be
2027.84 refrigerated or required Refrigeration
2030.34 just as do any good low sugar fermented
2033.88 foods by the way so for instance pickles
2035.919 are a low sugar fermented food that can
2037.6 support the gut microbiome but if you're
2039.22 buying pickles from the section of the
2040.72 grocery store where they the pickles are
2042.58 not
2044.08 refrigerated well then you're not going
2046.059 to get the gut microbiome supporting
2047.86 effects from those pickles it's so funny
2050.2 we're even having this conversation
2051.22 talking about pickles but the reality is
2052.839 they can greatly enhance the microbiota
2055.48 if you are getting the pickles that are
2058.78 and require refrigeration and include
2061.06 the brine which is the the liquid around
2063.58 them the same is true for sauerkraut
2065.139 non-refrigerated sauerkraut is not going
2067.54 to support your gut microbiome it will
2069.399 supply some other things perhaps but
2071.619 it's not going to support your gut
2072.58 microbiome it has to be the refrigerated
2074.02 versions for the reason that most people
2075.7 are not getting enough food based
2077.5 support for the gut microbiome and
2079.179 because of the importance of the gut
2080.26 microbiome one of the key categories of
2082.24 foundational supplements are supplements
2084.339 that create
2085.72 support for the microbiome through
2087.639 prebiotics or probiotics again they tend
2090.399 to be the refrigerated varieties are the
2092.08 ones that are actually going to work
2093.159 those also tend to be very expensive
2096.22 and there are some evidence that taking
2098.619 excessive amounts of prebiotics and
2101.08 probiotics that is typical of these
2103.839 capsule forms of prebiotics and
2105.76 probiotics if they're taken ongoing not
2108.58 for short periods of time but if they're
2109.839 taken ongoing can lead to some issues
2112.119 like brain fog there's a nice literature
2114.46 on this that and a growing one at that
2116.32 so my suggestion is that if people are
2119.02 going to take supplements to support the
2121.42 microbiome that those supplements
2123.66 include low enough levels that is small
2127.54 enough amounts of prebiotics and
2129.16 probiotics that you don't start to
2130.78 venture into the realm of brain fog and
2133.9 some of the other issues that could be
2135.46 associated with taking too much
2137.079 Prebiotic and probiotic in the form of
2139.18 supplements I'd like to take a brief
2141.16 break and thank our sponsor inside
2143.44 tracker inside tracker is a personalized
2146.2 nutrition platform that analyzes data
2148.119 from your blood and DNA to help you
2150.099 better understand your body and help you
2151.78 reach your health goals I've long been a
2153.94 believer in getting regular blood work
2155.32 done for the simple reason that many of
2157.72 the factors that impact your immediate
2159.28 and long-term Health can only be
2161.02 analyzed from a quality blood test the
2163.0 problem with a lot of blood and DNA
2164.38 tests out there however is that you get
2166.3 data back about metabolic factors lipids
2169.06 and hormones and so forth but you don't
2170.32 know what to do with those data inside
2172.0 tracker solves that problem and makes it
2174.22 very easy for you to understand what
2176.2 sorts of nutritional behavioral maybe
2179.079 even supplementation based interventions
2181.42 you might want to take on in order to
2183.52 adjust the numbers of those metabolic
2185.079 factors hormones lipids and other things
2187.18 that impact your immediate and long-term
2188.619 Health to bring those numbers into the
2191.079 ranges that are appropriate and indeed
2192.82 optimal for you if you'd like to try
2194.859 inside tracker you can visit inside
2196.24 tracker.com huberman and get 20 off any
2199.3 of inside tracker's plans that's inside
2201.099 tracker.com huberman to get 20 off the
2204.88 other category foundational supplements
2206.32 are those adaptogens that we mentioned
2208.24 earlier adaptogens again being a very
2210.88 poorly defined category but these are
2213.94 typically
2215.52 micronutrients herbs sometimes they go
2218.68 into the mushroom category again these
2220.3 are non psychedelic mushrooms that
2223.18 provide either some buffering to the
2225.28 stress system by reducing cortisol
2227.32 typically or that are thought to or
2230.32 known to based on research studies to
2232.48 enhance things like blood flow to the
2234.04 brain or to enhance some aspect of
2236.26 cognitive function by way of enhancing
2237.88 neurotransmitter function
2239.619 this category of so-called adaptogens is
2242.44 an important one we'll get back to this
2243.88 a little bit later the reason I mention
2245.5 it now is that it is indeed hard to get
2248.8 the so-called adaptogens in sufficient
2250.66 concentrations from food-based sources I
2253.78 have to assume that most people aren't
2255.04 out there collecting chaga mushroom or
2256.96 the ashwagandha herbs and then combining
2259.18 them with their salads or their foods
2260.8 and so that's why this adaptogen
2262.42 category fits into foundational now this
2265.599 opens up the category of foundational
2267.16 supplements that are broad spectrum that
2269.5 is that include vitamins and minerals
2271.3 that have digestive enzymes that have
2273.76 adaptogens and that also have prebiotics
2276.339 and probiotics at the appropriate
2277.9 dosages this is one reason why I'm a big
2280.24 fan of supplements like athletic greens
2282.4 which is as many of you know a sponsor
2284.56 of this podcast and does really nicely
2287.2 cover all of these categories of
2288.7 foundational nutrition but I do want to
2290.8 emphasize that this is not a way to
2293.32 focus on athletic greens specifically
2295.18 there are other categories and brands of
2298.359 excellent foundational nutritional
2300.28 supplements that cover these categories
2302.44 of vitamins and minerals probiotics
2304.72 prebiotics digestive enzymes and
2307.359 adaptogens it just so happens that that
2309.339 athletic greens is the one that I
2311.38 discovered and that works best for me
2312.64 and that many people find works really
2314.26 well for them so this is why when people
2316.3 approach me and they ask me as they
2318.88 often do very very often do I should say
2321.099 if I'm only going to take one supplement
2323.14 what supplement should I take rather
2325.3 than just give them one specific answer
2327.339 I actually asked them three questions
2329.02 first question I ask them is how well
2331.42 are you sleeping at night are you
2333.04 getting enough sleep are you waking up
2334.18 feeling rested because if they're not
2336.599 that opens up a whole different set of
2339.4 interactions that we need to have and
2340.96 discussions around what sorts of things
2342.579 they need to do and possibly take in
2345.22 order to get their sleep right because
2346.42 sleep is the foundation of mental health
2347.92 physical health and performance we will
2349.9 have that discussion a little bit later
2351.16 in this episode
2352.96 the second question I asked them is
2355.24 how's your nutrition that is are you
2358.42 eating regularly have you found the
2361.359 combination of macronutrients or which
2363.82 diet is right for you do you think
2365.44 you're getting enough vitamins and
2366.7 minerals how's your digestion we have
2368.68 that conversation and then the third
2370.78 thing that I ask which is extremely
2372.76 important is what's your budget because
2376.3 if somebody has ten dollars a month
2378.04 total to spend on supplements versus a
2380.56 thousand dollars a month to spend on
2381.88 supplements total well then there's a
2384.52 different set of conversations to be had
2386.38 as to which supplements they should take
2387.82 now once those three questions have been
2390.579 answered
2391.9 assuming that somebody is able to spend
2394.54 about a hundred dollars or more on
2397.3 supplements per month
2398.98 then my recommendation is that they not
2401.92 focus on any specific supplements
2403.599 directed towards sleep or toward Focus
2405.64 or hormone augmentation but rather that
2408.04 they focus on buffering and enhancing
2409.9 their foundational nutrition adaptogens
2412.859 probiotics prebiotics and digestive
2415.359 enzymes because of the simple fact that
2417.4 if they do that they're going to raise
2420.16 the tide on all the biological and organ
2422.44 systems that are going to lead to
2423.7 enhanced mental health physical health
2425.079 and performance including sleep
2427.96 so this is one reason why if people say
2430.06 well if I can only take one supplement
2431.38 what should I take I say well what's
2433.0 your budget if they say they can meet
2434.98 that hundred dollar threshold per month
2436.66 then my recommendation would be athletic
2438.76 greens or something like it or that they
2441.46 invest the time and energy to go find
2443.2 the various combinations of vitamins and
2444.88 minerals and probiotics and prebiotics
2447.4 and adaptogens and so forth in
2450.4 individual
2451.66 components that they can then take in
2454.54 combination in order to meet their
2456.339 foundational needs but most people are
2458.2 not interested in doing all that
2459.4 homework and legwork to figure out
2460.839 exactly what those dosages are that's
2463.06 one reason why indeed I have taken
2465.099 athletic green since 2012. I like it it
2467.2 makes me feel better I have more energy
2468.52 I sleep better my digestion is certainly
2470.38 better and it supports the gut
2471.339 microbiome I do that for that reason but
2474.28 again I want to emphasize that there are
2476.2 other great sources of all the relevant
2478.72 things within those foundational
2480.04 formulas that athletic greens contains
2482.26 so it's certainly not the only route to
2484.359 covering your foundational Health needs
2487.18 there are other ways to do that now if
2489.16 somebody has a budget lower than a
2490.72 hundred dollars per month to spend on
2492.46 foundational supplementation well then
2494.859 there are a couple of discussions to be
2496.839 had now if the amount of money that they
2498.7 have to devote to foundational
2500.32 supplementation is zero of course
2502.839 respect that and then it becomes a
2504.76 discussion about what sorts of foods and
2507.94 patterns of food intake are going to
2509.859 best support their mental health
2511.0 physical health performance now if
2513.4 somebody has somewhere between zero
2516.099 dollars and fifty dollars to spend on
2518.44 supplementation for sake of this thing
2520.66 we're calling foundational Health per
2522.339 month well then a different category of
2524.68 supplement discussion arises and we'll
2526.839 have that in a moment but to sort of
2528.4 close the conversation on foundational
2530.5 supplementation
2532.24 again that means many different things
2534.579 it's vitamins and minerals sometimes
2536.44 that's one vitamin and mineral
2538.06 supplement it means digestive enzymes
2540.7 that could be its own supplement or in
2542.92 combination with vitamins and minerals
2544.24 it means often not always adaptogens
2547.42 things like ashwagandha different
2550.079 plant-based and mushroom-based
2551.98 formulations that can buffer stress and
2554.26 provide other brain and body support
2556.42 and it often although not always but
2559.72 should I believe include the probiotics
2562.0 and prebiotics or anything that supports
2564.46 healthy gut microbiome
2566.619 once again I think a broad spectrum
2569.44 supplement that has many many
2570.7 ingredients of high quality that covers
2573.04 all these bases is going to be the best
2575.26 route to ensuring foundational
2577.78 supplementation is covered and I do
2580.3 think that should be the starting place
2582.24 for any and all supplementation regimens
2586.54 I'll say that once again I think
2587.98 covering your foundational needs in the
2591.04 realm of vitamins minerals probiotics
2592.96 digestive enzymes and
2595.74 adaptogens is going to give you the most
2598.42 benefit
2599.8 by cost and the most benefit across the
2602.859 board in terms of brain and body systems
2604.48 that's going to allow you to feel better
2606.4 overall sleep better overall focus
2609.04 better overall and support all the
2611.68 different systems in your brain and body
2613.119 that are going to allow you to be at
2615.339 your best while of course also paying
2617.98 careful attention to your nutrition
2619.599 because you simply cannot abandon
2622.0 nutrition again Better Living Through
2623.92 Chemistry still requires Better Living
2625.9 so now that we've had that discussion
2627.579 about foundational supplementation
2629.8 and again highlighting the fact that
2631.54 that's the one category of
2632.92 supplementation where multi-ingredient
2635.38 formulations make the most sense I'd
2638.5 like to now shift our attention to
2640.54 single ingredient formulation
2641.92 supplements that are designed to achieve
2644.319 specific endpoints and here again rather
2647.2 than focus on specific ingredients and
2650.26 supplements to achieve specific
2651.579 endpoints because we've done that
2653.56 already in episodes related to sleep and
2655.48 focus Etc
2657.04 I'd like to take a step back and focus
2659.38 on the larger theme of today's episode
2661.38 which is how to think about
2663.76 supplementation in a rational cost
2666.4 effective and biologically effective way
2668.74 for each of these categories and the
2670.839 three categories that I'm going to cover
2672.3 are sleep
2674.74 hormone support and cognitive
2677.02 enhancement and focus cognitive
2678.88 enhancement and focus being the final
2680.38 third category
2682.359 let's talk about sleep and the rational
2684.88 approach to thinking about
2686.079 supplementation for sleep as I mentioned
2688.3 earlier in this episode and on many
2690.22 previous episodes of this podcast sleep
2693.04 is the foundation of mental health
2694.96 physical health and performance
2697.72 you might be somebody who can do an
2699.4 all-nighter and feel okay the next day
2701.68 or maybe even great but most everybody
2704.44 once they start to have minimal sleep
2707.319 for one or two nights in the form of
2709.3 broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep
2711.94 or sleeping at the wrong time of night
2713.859 there is such a thing or day
2716.92 they start to suffer their mood starts
2719.26 to suffer their cognitive Clarity and
2721.9 performance starts to suffer their
2723.94 mental health can suffer severely and
2725.619 physical performance definitely suffers
2727.3 hormone suffer everything suffers
2729.579 conversely
2731.2 when people are sleeping well that is
2734.26 deeply and enough eighty percent of the
2736.839 nights of their life
2738.579 mental health physical health and
2740.319 performance all flourish and I think
2742.06 most people start to be almost amazed at
2745.54 how well they're doing in various
2747.52 domains of life that previously they
2749.14 might have struggled with so sleep is
2751.3 fundamental that's that's established
2754.9 when thinking about supplementation for
2756.64 sleep we need to ask ourselves a number
2758.5 of important questions first of all you
2760.839 should ask yourself how well that is how
2763.18 deeply and how much are you sleeping per
2764.74 night assuming you're somebody who can
2766.359 fall asleep easily stay asleep through
2767.8 the night wake up feeling relatively
2769.839 rested maybe a little groggy and then
2771.94 can move about your day with plenty of
2773.8 energy and focus you're not falling
2775.54 asleep in class or at work or behind the
2777.64 wheel whereas a passenger on public
2779.859 transportation
2781.599 well then you're probably getting enough
2783.16 sleep and by the way it's perfectly
2784.96 normal to require anywhere from a 10
2787.42 minute to a 90 minute nap in the
2788.98 afternoon for some people if you're not
2790.54 a napper no big deal it's known that
2793.839 naps can disrupt nighttime sleep but
2795.819 provided that they're early enough in
2797.38 the day if you take a nap and you are
2799.48 still able to fall asleep at night then
2802.24 naps are fine for you if you're somebody
2803.98 who doesn't like naps because you wake
2805.42 up groggy or grumpy which often happens
2807.7 to certain people then don't nap
2811.24 you certainly do not need to nap but if
2813.64 you're feeling energetic throughout the
2814.9 day chances are you're getting enough
2816.4 sleep at night but there are people of
2818.56 course who are struggling with sleep
2819.76 either falling asleep staying asleep or
2821.5 they're not feeling alert enough during
2822.819 the day or all of the above and then it
2824.98 makes sense to step back and take a look
2826.66 at what supplementation can provide
2829.24 if you are one of those people who is
2831.099 not sleeping enough or well enough at
2833.38 night that you are suffering during the
2835.599 day in whatever way mild to severe there
2838.18 are two questions you should ask
2839.2 yourself first of all are you ingesting
2840.94 caffeine after 2 pm if the answer is yes
2843.7 you want to limit or eliminate caffeine
2846.52 after 2 pm maybe even push it back to
2848.92 noon or earlier I know that can be
2850.96 excruciating for some folks but it can
2853.18 really help with your ability to fall
2855.22 and stay asleep at night second thing is
2857.02 most people would do well to avoid food
2859.3 within the two hours prior to bedtime
2862.42 but of course you don't want to be so
2864.52 hungry that you can't fall asleep all
2866.5 right so those are the nutrition and
2868.359 behavioral tools that everyone needs to
2869.74 consider if you are not ingesting
2871.66 caffeine
2872.98 2 p.m or onwards and you are not eating
2876.52 excessively immediately prior to bedtime
2878.079 or within the two hours prior to bedtime
2879.64 and you're not hungry when you go to
2881.619 sleep well then there are certain
2883.24 supplements that can support your sleep
2884.859 and we've talked about these in the
2886.119 perfect sleep episode and in the episode
2888.819 with our guest expert Matt Walker from
2890.98 University of California Berkeley and in
2892.48 the master your sleep episode and we
2893.74 have a tool kit for sleep that you can
2895.54 access zero cost by going to
2897.22 hearinglab.com and going to the menu go
2898.9 to the newsletter and you can find that
2900.099 toolkit you can sign up for other free
2901.96 toolkits like it but
2904.78 the point here is not to go
2906.22 systematically through each of the
2907.54 supplements that is beneficial or has
2909.4 been shown to be beneficial for sleep
2910.72 but rather to address specific aspects
2913.54 of sleep that can suffer and why and how
2916.359 certain patterns of supplementation can
2918.64 support or alleviate those pain points
2921.52 if for instance you're somebody who
2923.859 falls asleep just fine but wakes up in
2926.44 the middle of the night
2928.119 around 2 or 3 A.M or any time for that
2930.339 matter and has trouble falling back
2931.9 asleep there are two categories of
2934.06 supplements that you might want to
2935.74 consider the first is myoinositol
2938.26 typically taken as 900 milligrams of
2940.119 myoinositol myoinositol can help shorten
2942.819 the amount of time that it takes to fall
2944.26 back asleep if you wake up in the middle
2946.42 of the night myoinositol has other
2948.76 beneficial uses as well for mood Etc if
2952.359 you'd like to see many of the different
2954.16 effects that have been explored in the
2955.66 scientific literature from myoinositol
2957.4 you can go to examine.com it's an
2959.14 excellent site not just for inositol but
2961.66 for all supplements for that matter
2963.46 talks about the human effect Matrix that
2966.04 is the different effects of different
2967.48 supplement compounds on different
2969.099 aspects of hormone brain and body Health
2970.9 where the evidence is strong where the
2973.119 evidence is weak has links to studies
2974.98 and so on again it's examine.com amazing
2976.96 website wonderful website it's provided
2979.119 such a rich resource for me and for you
2981.4 know many many other people
2984.46 other people who wake up in the middle
2986.02 of the night will wake up because their
2987.64 dreams are very intense or they were
2990.819 having dreams that were so vivid that
2992.619 suddenly they were jolted from their
2994.0 dreams those people would do well to
2996.64 avoid certain supplements so in a moment
2999.22 I'll talk about the value of a
3000.839 supplement called theanine for falling
3003.119 asleep but theanine which typically is
3006.119 taken in dosages anywhere from 100
3008.339 milligrams to 400 milligrams depending
3011.28 on body weight and experience and what
3014.46 you find to be most effective for you
3016.079 minimally effective for you well the
3018.18 Indian can be great for many people but
3019.56 for people who have excessively vivid
3021.78 dreams
3022.98 those excessively vivid dreams can lead
3025.26 to immediate waking and sometimes a
3027.54 little bit of anxiety upon waking in the
3029.339 middle of the night so some people who
3031.2 wake up in the middle of the night so
3032.7 jolted
3033.9 mentally and physically out of sleep
3036.24 because of their intense dreams would do
3040.02 well to avoid theanine supplementation
3042.359 I've talked about this a bit before but
3044.76 it's something that I think a lot of
3046.92 nighttime middle of the night wakers
3048.66 might be familiar with and would want to
3051.0 take into consideration now for those of
3053.22 you that are not waking up in the middle
3054.42 of the night or not having excessively
3055.8 vivid dreams but are having trouble
3057.599 falling asleep
3059.22 two supplements in particular have been
3061.44 shown to be effective for shortening the
3063.96 transition time to sleep and allowing
3065.52 people to ease into sleep more readily
3068.339 and those are magnesium 3 and 8 which is
3071.16 interchangeable with magnesium bis
3073.619 glycinate
3074.88 magnesium bisclycinate and magnesium
3077.099 threonate both
3078.78 have transporter systems that allow them
3081.0 to readily cross the blood-brain barrier
3082.74 and they lead to a mild form of
3084.9 drowsiness mild in the sense that it's
3086.7 not going to prevent you from operating
3088.079 a motor vehicle or kind of any
3090.319 conditions under emergency that might
3092.28 arise in the middle of the night or if
3093.96 they did a rise during the middle of
3094.92 night you'd still be able to function so
3096.18 it's not like a sleeping pill but people
3098.16 who take those often find that their
3100.68 transition time into sleep is much
3102.059 faster and their sleep is also much
3103.5 deeper incidentally those supplements
3105.9 are also thought to be useful for
3108.48 cognitive support and neuroprotection
3111.42 although there's less data on that
3113.64 okay so that's for falling asleep that's
3115.26 one category either magnesium magnesium
3118.02 three and eight or bis glycine would be
3119.52 interchangeable for assisting the
3121.44 transition time into sleep and then the
3123.96 other supplement is apogenin API
3125.88 g-e-n-i-n apogenin which is a derivative
3128.28 of chamomile I've talked about this in
3129.72 various podcasts before also acts as a
3132.3 bit of a anxiety lowering compound which
3135.96 is essential prior to sleep for people
3137.7 to essentially turn off their thinking
3139.98 or to be able to reduce the amount of
3141.48 ruminating and problem solving and
3143.16 future anticipation that they're doing
3144.48 which is a requirement for falling
3145.98 asleep so what's the rational approach
3148.2 to supplementing in a way that allows
3151.319 you to fall asleep more quickly and stay
3153.599 asleep well would you immediately take
3156.24 magnesium three Nate and apogenin
3158.22 together well that depends if you have
3159.66 the budget and you just simply want to
3161.52 fall asleep quicker and you don't care
3162.66 which of those two ingredients is going
3164.28 to be more effective for you well then
3165.839 you could try one for instance magnesium
3168.119 three and eight and try it for perhaps a
3170.88 week and see how that affects your
3172.38 latency to sleep time that is how
3174.119 quickly you fall asleep or you can try
3175.68 apogenic in the first week or you could
3177.599 combine them both or you could try
3179.64 magnesium three night for a week then
3181.44 switch to only apogenin for a week and
3184.5 evaluate which one works better for you
3186.42 if neither works for you I do recommend
3188.099 trying the combination together again
3190.14 this is just the way that any scientist
3192.119 would design an experiment to try and
3194.099 understand which variables that is which
3197.3 ingredients are most effective for the
3200.28 result that you want as opposed to just
3201.9 lumping them together and taking them
3203.46 that said a lot of people want excellent
3206.76 sleep so badly that they just say okay
3208.74 I'm just going to take magnesium 3 and 8
3210.359 I'm going to take apogen and I'm going
3211.44 to take theanine if my dreams are too
3213.18 Vivid and I'm waking up in the middle of
3214.559 the night from excessively vivid dreams
3216.54 I'll drop the theanine and many people
3218.52 actually derive great benefit from that
3220.5 approach but because today we're talking
3222.18 about the most rational cost effective
3223.859 and biologically effective approach to
3225.3 supplementation if you're not sleeping
3227.7 as well as you would like to
3229.559 or if you want to explore what sleeping
3232.02 even more deeply might do for your
3234.96 mental health physical health and
3236.16 performance well then it makes sense to
3238.559 think about the various supplements for
3241.2 falling asleep versus remaining asleep
3243.42 what to include what not to include and
3245.64 to do that systematically and again I
3247.38 think one week's time of taking
3249.24 something provided it doesn't
3251.4 induce any negative effects right if
3254.16 something induces a negative effect I
3255.96 recommend ceasing taking it immediately
3257.7 but if something does not produce any
3259.859 negative effects then I think you want
3261.78 to try a single ingredient formulation
3263.4 for about a week while not varying
3265.8 anything else not changing anything else
3267.9 in your overall Protocols of nutrition
3270.839 or supplementation I mean it's
3272.819 impossible to clamp everything perfectly
3274.859 from week to week but you know don't
3276.42 change anything else dramatically and
3278.4 just add that supplement for a given
3280.5 week see how it benefits your sleep
3282.18 maybe add in a second second supplement
3284.64 if you like or rather Swap and try a
3287.22 different supplement for a week and then
3289.02 see what works best and see if the
3291.0 combination works even better now I
3293.16 acknowledge that what I just described
3294.48 is exceedingly basic but it's something
3297.3 that I don't think most people do most
3299.64 people either decide they have the
3301.74 budget and the interest in just
3303.059 improving their sleep across the board
3304.26 and they don't care what ingredient is
3306.119 providing the maximum benefit or they
3309.54 simply try something and decide oh well
3311.7 it didn't work for me and so I'm not
3313.14 going to try anything else supplements
3314.64 don't work for me or magnesium doesn't
3316.02 work for me or
3317.46 um you know I woke up in the middle of
3318.72 the night from vivid dreams and that's
3319.98 because they're taking more of a shotgun
3321.54 approach without teasing out the
3323.4 different variables in fact if there's
3324.839 an overriding theme of today's
3325.98 conversation it's really about learning
3328.319 how to isolate variables in the realm of
3330.96 supplementation because once you do that
3333.38 and once you start to develop that
3336.119 Intuition or sensitivity of sorts to how
3339.3 different ingredients impact you
3341.88 it is an enormously powerful stance to
3344.339 have because you're going to keep your
3346.44 costs limited you're also going to find
3348.72 the things that work particularly poorly
3351.059 for you and more importantly the things
3353.04 that work particularly well for you
3354.66 toward your goals any discussion about
3356.76 supplementation for sleep
3359.4 I feel has to include a discussion about
3361.26 melatonin I've talked about melatonin
3363.059 before on numerous podcasts mine and
3365.099 others and I will say once again I am
3367.92 not a fan of melatonin for a couple of
3369.599 reasons melatonin is a hormone known to
3372.119 induce sleepiness but not keep us asleep
3374.88 so oftentimes people will take melatonin
3376.5 fall deeply asleep and then wake up and
3378.42 have trouble falling back asleep the
3380.7 other reason is that melatonin
3382.2 supplements almost always include levels
3384.18 of melatonin or amounts of melatonin
3385.859 that far far exceed the normal
3389.3 biological levels or so-called
3391.319 endogenous levels of melatonin that we
3393.18 would normally produce and yes it's true
3394.859 that as we age we produce less melatonin
3397.559 but melatonin as a hormone also impacts
3400.92 other hormone systems in particular the
3403.14 reproductive hormone access testosterone
3404.94 estrogen Etc which is not to say that if
3407.099 you've been taking melatonin for some
3408.48 period of time that you've disrupted
3410.4 your fertility or those hormone axes but
3413.76 it's possible that you've disrupted them
3415.38 somewhat and it's very clear that
3417.96 melatonin can impact not just sleep but
3420.18 other systems in the brain and body it
3422.7 can be useful for jet lag and for
3424.68 occasional use but they're also I want
3427.2 to voice a message of caution
3430.38 there have been studies exploring the
3432.72 dosages of melatonin contained in
3435.059 various supplements
3436.8 and whether or not what's listed on the
3438.599 bottle matches what's actually contained
3440.28 in those formulations and despite those
3443.339 formulations coming from quite reliable
3445.44 quote unquote or thought to be reliable
3447.48 sources it was found that these
3450.0 supplements contain anywhere from 15
3451.559 percent
3452.819 of what's
3454.38 thought to be or is told to be in those
3457.02 supplements or
3459.0 many times more melatonin than is listed
3461.94 on the bottle so the dosaging does not
3463.619 seem to be consistent with what's often
3465.119 listed on the bottle and this is even
3466.619 true within some of the more reputable
3468.059 Brands so that's a real concern so we
3471.42 need to highlight melatonin as perhaps
3473.16 something that's only used occasionally
3475.44 if you want to talk about dosages for
3477.119 melatonin use for jet lag Etc go to
3481.14 examine.com there's some excellent
3483.14 references to studies there just put
3485.46 melatonin into the search function it'll
3487.26 tell you everything you need to know
3488.22 about melatonin but now you know my
3490.26 stance on melatonin one question I often
3492.42 get about supplementation for sleep is
3494.28 does it create a dependency that's an
3496.859 excellent question to ask
3498.599 I think most people
3500.52 worry about even fear relying on
3503.7 something so heavily that if they did
3505.319 not have it for whatever reason that
3506.88 they couldn't sleep
3508.26 in my experience there is no problem
3511.98 falling and staying asleep in the
3514.5 absence of a supplement for sleep even
3517.559 if you've been taking that supplement
3518.76 for sleep
3520.02 consistently seven days a week for
3521.819 months and months maybe even years on
3523.26 end I confess that I occasionally fall
3526.5 asleep having not taken my pre-sleep
3530.52 supplements and I happen to take
3531.9 magnesium three and eight theanine and
3533.52 epigenin I also take inositol it greatly
3536.64 enhances my sleep and there have been
3538.14 nights when I've fallen asleep not
3539.4 having taken any of those things and
3541.38 I've slept fine that said if I were to
3544.319 explore multiple nights of trying to
3546.96 sleep without that supplementation I
3548.4 find that my sleep is not as good I'm
3550.38 still able to fall asleep but the depth
3553.14 of my sleep and the duration of my sleep
3554.94 is not as good as when I'm supplementing
3557.04 so I think that's
3558.72 refreshing news at least to me that
3561.059 there isn't a dependence on these
3562.98 supplements in order to be able to fall
3564.839 asleep it's not the same sort of
3566.22 dependence that people experience from
3568.2 things like sleeping pills that said
3571.38 any compound any compound can create a
3574.92 placebo type effect where we think we
3577.98 need something in order to achieve a
3579.48 certain effect we had a guest on this
3581.46 podcast
3582.599 some time ago Dr Ali Crum who's a
3585.299 professor at Stanford and works on these
3586.98 mindset effects belief effects and
3589.74 Placebo effects and Placebo effects can
3592.38 be very real and in some sense dovetail
3596.52 with any conversation about dependency
3598.22 meaning if you are somebody who loves
3601.02 your sleep supplements and sleeps great
3603.0 with them and one night you discover you
3605.64 don't have them or you can't access them
3607.26 for whatever reason that can create a
3609.839 little bit of an anxiety around the idea
3612.059 that oh in the in their absence you're
3614.22 not going to be able to sleep and that's
3615.9 a sort of a placebo effect in Reverse if
3618.18 you will because what it suggests is
3620.04 that there's a emotional or a cognitive
3623.64 association with taking these things
3625.02 that allows you to sleep well I would
3627.48 highly recommend that people explore
3629.94 this issue of dependency and Placebo
3632.16 effects for Sleep supplements on their
3634.26 own and under conditions in which
3635.52 there's nothing pressing the next day
3637.38 that is you don't have a big
3638.28 presentation
3639.599 Etc so what I recommend is that every
3642.119 two weeks or so maybe every month or so
3645.0 take one night off completely from all
3648.0 your sleep supplements or leave out one
3650.04 sleep supplement try to understand to
3651.96 what extent you might have established a
3654.42 dependency either real or Placebo based
3657.059 on these sleep supplements and again I
3659.64 suggest doing this on perhaps a Friday
3661.619 night so that you know it's a weekend
3663.24 the next day so you don't have to work
3664.74 if perhaps you don't sleep well I think
3667.079 what you'll find is what most people
3668.64 find and that's
3671.16 in the absence of taking your supplement
3673.68 stack for Sleep one night you're still
3676.559 gonna sleep just fine now does that mean
3678.839 that these supplements are not actually
3680.7 working under normal conditions where
3682.92 you're taking them each night no what
3684.9 this means is that many of these things
3687.14 magnesiums in particular can build up in
3690.42 the body and brain in a way that can be
3692.7 beneficial and what probably explains
3695.46 the fact that you can still sleep if you
3697.38 miss a night of taking them is that the
3699.72 neural circuits that are involved in
3701.94 turning off thinking or in not thinking
3704.22 and falling asleep those neural circuits
3706.44 undergo what's called plasticity in
3708.299 other words if you get better at falling
3709.799 and staying asleep over time even if you
3711.72 got better at that through the
3713.64 Assistance or with the assistance of
3715.26 some supplement or combination of
3716.64 supplements well then those circuits are
3718.98 still going to function just fine even
3721.5 in the absence of not taking those
3723.54 supplements just once we'll get back
3725.22 into this conversation a little bit
3727.02 later when we talk about cognitive
3728.579 enhancement and focus
3730.44 it's the same story there where indeed
3733.44 there are things that people can take in
3735.42 stimulant form and non-stimulant form
3737.76 that can enhance cognitive ability and
3739.5 focus but that does not mean that you
3742.14 become so dependent on those that you
3744.299 can't focus unless you take them this
3746.52 has been shown multiple times over so
3748.559 again to answer the question is there a
3751.14 dependency established by taking
3752.339 supplements for sleep
3753.9 the short answer is no with the caveat
3756.059 that Placebo effects and belief effects
3758.579 are always going to be at play whether
3760.38 or not you're talking about
3760.92 supplementation prescription drugs or
3762.599 even behavioral protocols for that
3764.099 matter I'd like to take a brief break
3765.96 and acknowledge our sponsor athletic

3865.68 the episodes and specific time points
3867.72 where that topic happens to be covered
3869.94 now Hormone Health is such an important
3871.859 topic to discuss in the context of
3873.9 supplementation because
3876.24 indeed there are compounds that are
3879.119 non-prescription based so-called
3880.98 supplements that can improve hormone
3883.92 function again anytime we are discussing
3886.26 a particular aspect of mental health
3887.819 physical health or performance we need
3890.339 to start with a mention of the few
3892.319 behavioral tools and nutrition-based
3894.54 tools or at least some top Contour
3896.76 coverage of those in a way that frames
3899.099 up the discussion about supplementation
3900.599 appropriately
3902.16 so in the context of hormone support and
3905.099 augmentation and optimization
3908.28 if you are not getting adequate calories
3910.76 from high quality sources
3914.28 hormones like testosterone and estrogen
3916.26 will suffer this is one of the reasons
3917.819 why women will stop having their periods
3921.059 if they're not ingesting enough calories
3922.68 this is one of the reasons why
3924.359 testosterone levels will drop if people
3927.18 are not ingesting enough calories in
3928.799 fact on the episode with expert guest
3931.14 and medical doctor Peter attia he
3933.839 described how sex hormone binding
3935.819 globulin this is a protein that's
3938.04 present in males and females that binds
3940.14 to testosterone and other hormones and
3942.96 prevents it from being in its free form
3944.579 which is the more active form well
3947.28 insulin which of course is going to
3949.2 increase after the ingestion of
3950.88 carbohydrates in particular insulin
3953.339 actually inhibits or reduces sex hormone
3955.68 binding globulin what this means is that
3957.96 for you intermittent fasters or people
3959.7 that are ingesting very few
3960.78 carbohydrates or have very low blood
3962.64 glucose or perhaps are taking things
3965.4 like metformin or berberine which is a
3967.619 supplement based approach to reducing
3970.38 blood glucose well your sex hormone
3973.319 binding globulin is going to increase
3975.359 dramatically conversely if you are
3977.579 eating enough calories in the form of
3980.579 foods that allow your insulin to be a
3982.619 bit higher not excessively High we hope
3984.599 but a bit higher well then sex hormone
3986.819 bonding globulin will go down and free
3988.319 testosterone will go up so the
3990.42 discussion about hormone support and
3992.28 augmentation has to include some nod
3995.16 toward or understanding of the fact that
3996.839 nutrition and the way that nutrition
3998.94 impacts hormones and the way that
4000.68 hormones such as insulin impact other
4002.42 hormones such as free testosterone that
4005.0 all has to be acknowledged that is not
4006.559 the topic of today's discussion but it's
4008.24 important that I remind everybody that
4010.579 nutrition matters for General hormone
4013.819 status
4014.96 it's also important to remember that
4016.4 behaviors matter for hormone status
4019.64 getting morning sunlight increases
4021.98 cortisol levels cortisol levels are very
4024.74 important to have elevated early in the
4027.079 day for focus and alertness and for
4029.18 immune function and to make sure that
4031.039 cortisol levels are low at night and
4033.619 thereby levels of growth hormone and
4036.14 testosterone which is secreted mainly in
4038.059 the early morning can be elevated at
4040.52 night and in the early morning so
4042.44 getting morning sunlight getting
4043.94 strenuous exercise in the form of both
4045.619 cardiovascular exercise but also
4048.14 relatively short meaning an hour or less
4050.299 bouts
4051.44 of intense resistance training a few
4054.559 times per week can also dramatically
4056.9 alter hormone profiles in fact in the
4059.24 episode that we did with Dr Duncan
4060.68 French again you find that episode at
4062.539 hubermanlab.com he described a very
4064.819 strenuous but still brief two day a week
4068.96 protocol of using resistance training
4071.24 specifically to increase testosterone
4073.339 and free testosterone and growth hormone
4074.96 and so on
4076.099 so nutrition matters exercise matters
4079.28 when it comes to increasing supporting
4081.859 or augmenting different hormones and
4083.66 that's just the discussion about
4084.98 testosterone free testosterone and
4086.48 estrogen there's also the vast
4088.4 discussion about thyroid hormone Etc
4090.02 again we've covered all those topics in
4091.76 previous episodes but once those
4094.88 behavioral
4096.14 tools are in place once you're doing the
4098.299 right things and you're avoiding the
4099.859 wrong things
4100.88 doing the right things to support your
4102.5 hormones and avoiding the things that
4104.42 diminish hormones in the ways that can
4107.12 be detrimental
4108.56 once your nutrition is in place to
4111.319 support your hormones then it makes
4112.88 sense to turn and consider what
4116.0 supplements can support hormones but I
4118.279 do believe that you want to get your
4119.839 behaviors and your nutrition correct
4121.52 before you start thinking about
4122.719 supplementation for hormones again I'll
4124.52 repeat that get your nutrition and your
4126.38 behaviors correct
4128.299 for sake of hormones and for other
4130.52 health purposes before you start
4132.08 thinking about supplementation for
4133.64 hormones and certainly before you start
4135.259 thinking about prescription-based
4136.52 approaches to improving hormones
4140.179 once all of those other elements are in
4142.52 place
4143.42 the supplements that make sense in terms
4146.48 of augmenting hormones come in two forms
4148.64 one are broadband support for multiple
4152.839 hormones and then the others are
4155.259 supplements that are designed to
4157.219 increase or in some cases decrease
4159.339 specific hormones or hormone Pathways so
4161.839 let's consider each of those in tandem
4164.9 there are certain supplements things
4167.0 like Sheila G for instance something
4168.92 from ayurvedic medicine which may mainly
4171.319 uh has the active ingredient fulvic acid
4173.96 which is known to for instance increase
4176.0 things like FSH follicle stimulating
4178.699 hormone which in women is going to
4180.739 increase certain aspects of egg growth
4184.58 hence the name follicle stimulating
4186.739 hormone it's going to stimulate certain
4189.739 aspects of fertility it's Pro fertile
4191.839 and in males can make for more sperm
4195.62 production or more motile sperm FSH is
4198.5 also going to indirectly increase
4200.06 testosterone in males it's known to
4201.86 increase libido in both males and
4203.96 females so things like shilaji can
4206.3 indeed augment multiple hormones and
4208.76 support multiple hormone systems
4210.32 generally in the direction of
4212.06 pro-fertility pro libido and increasing
4216.56 estrogen and testosterone
4218.9 now there are other supplements such as
4221.06 ashwagandha that also fall into this
4223.1 category of affecting multiple hormones
4225.219 ashwagandha is a very potent
4228.14 supplement in terms of reducing cortisol
4230.9 levels it has also been shown to
4233.42 increase testosterone levels but
4235.64 probably indirectly and that's because
4237.26 cortisol and testosterone sort of exist
4239.78 on a seesaw in terms of Pathways they're
4242.659 on separate Pathways but those Pathways
4244.46 interact enough that when cortisol is
4246.44 lowered in general testosterone tends to
4248.96 increase now it is important that with
4251.0 certain hormones like ashwagandha that
4252.44 you don't take them for more than two
4254.179 weeks at a time at high dosages if you
4255.86 want to know more of the specifics
4257.06 around ashwagandha and how long to take
4258.739 it how to cycle it Etc
4260.9 please see our episode on Master stress
4263.0 please also see the examine.com website
4266.06 and put in ashwagandha it will get into
4268.219 some of that description
4269.719 but
4271.1 Sheila G ashwagandha and things for
4274.159 instance like L-Carnitine a supplement
4275.9 that we often discuss in terms of
4278.239 fertility because it can indeed improve
4280.34 sperm motility and quality and egg
4283.159 quality so it's a pro fertile compound
4285.98 but it also impacts various
4287.659 mitochondrial Pathways so it's having a
4290.12 more indirect effect on hormones there
4292.64 are many other
4294.14 compounds present and available
4296.0 supplements that are purported to be
4298.659 pro-hormone support in particular for
4301.28 testosterone or estrogen fertility and
4303.199 libido there is a description for
4305.659 instance of things like maca root maca
4308.179 root can increase libido it's
4310.94 found to be particularly effective in
4312.679 women but in men as well and in all
4315.199 people who are suffering from lower
4317.0 libido due to intake of ssris selective
4321.739 serotonin reuptake inhibitors for
4323.42 whatever reason ssris are used to treat
4325.219 OCD they're used to treat depression any
4327.08 number of different things maca root can
4329.6 be in many instances effective in
4331.159 increasing libido it does that however
4333.8 through augmentation of dopamine related
4336.38 Pathways and some of the hormone
4338.3 Pathways Upstream of testosterone and
4340.34 estrogen the reports that Maca increases
4342.98 testosterone
4344.42 are somewhat scant and a little bit weak
4347.6 to be honest so it's having these
4349.52 indirect effects that may impact
4351.32 testosterone Downstream so again I'd put
4353.239 Maca alongside ashwagandha alongside
4355.84 shilaji as
4357.92 supplements that are impacting multiple
4359.96 hormone Pathways toward increased libido
4362.239 increased fertility increased
4364.1 testosterone or estrogen likely through
4367.219 indirect pathways
4368.9 now with all that said I'd like to
4370.94 provide some examples of
4373.1 supplements that work more directly on
4375.679 specific hormone Pathways aimed at
4377.54 achieving more specific goals such as
4380.0 elevated testosterone or elevated free
4382.4 testosterone or elevated growth hormone
4385.34 for that matter and elevated thyroid
4387.92 hormone I'd like to talk about growth
4390.02 hormone first because it's actually a
4391.64 pretty short discussion first of all the
4394.46 best way to augment growth hormone is to
4396.38 get quality deep sleep especially the
4398.36 sleep that occurs in the first three or
4399.86 four hours of the night is when growth
4401.3 hormone is released and it's going to be
4403.64 beneficial to avoid caloric intake in
4406.159 the two hours preceding sleep again
4408.14 don't go to bed so hungry that you wake
4410.659 up an hour or an hour and a half later
4412.4 or you have trouble falling asleep but
4414.44 avoiding food intake in the two hours
4416.0 prior to sleep and certainly avoiding
4417.8 alcohol and cannabis is going to
4420.38 facilitate growth hormone release in the
4422.84 first hours of sleep many people use
4425.48 intermittent fasting or even longer
4427.1 periods of fasting to increase growth
4428.719 hormone
4429.56 one of the interesting things I learned
4431.36 from an expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette
4433.34 who's a medical doctor
4435.14 on this podcast is that indeed while
4438.219 lengthy or fast or intermittent fasting
4440.659 can increase growth hormone levels very
4442.94 substantially it has indirect effects on
4446.12 the genetic Pathways and The receptors
4448.46 for growth hormone that actually are
4451.04 detrimental for the function of growth
4452.9 hormone so avoiding food for the two
4454.76 hours prior to bedtime is a good idea if
4456.98 you avoid food for longer that's just
4458.54 going to assist even more certainly
4460.88 isn't going to hurt in terms of growth
4462.92 hormone release but extended fast
4465.44 specifically for the purpose of
4467.0 increasing growth hormone
4468.679 are not really logical when you look at
4471.5 the broader effects of extended fast
4473.9 that is not to say that extended fasting
4476.12 is not appropriate for some people it
4477.92 can be in certain instances or that
4480.02 intermittent fasted so-called time
4481.28 restricted feeding is not beneficial for
4483.26 some people it can be here I'm only
4485.36 referring to the effects or in this case
4487.58 the lack of effects of intermittent
4489.32 fasting time restricted feeding on
4491.48 growth hormones specifically now in
4493.52 terms of supplements to increase growth
4495.86 hormone there are very few supplements
4498.38 that have been shown to augment this
4500.179 pathway there is some idea that Arginine
4503.06 supplementation prior to bedtime can
4505.699 further Elevate levels of growth hormone
4508.1 especially when fasted that literature
4510.5 is rather weak to be honest I encourage
4512.12 you to go to examine.com if you want to
4513.86 peruse those particular studies
4516.26 really the things that increase growth
4518.48 hormone very potently fall outside the
4521.42 realm of supplementation they include
4523.58 exercise again look at the Duncan French
4525.8 episode or
4527.78 in the Kyle Gillette episode on
4529.34 optimizing hormones in males in
4531.08 particular but this also pertains to
4532.34 females that avoiding food two hours
4534.679 prior to bedtime really can boost growth
4536.84 hormone significantly in sleep beyond
4539.48 what it would be otherwise but it's
4540.98 really only once you get into the realm
4542.42 of prescription compounds things like
4544.52 peptides like sermorelin which increase
4547.159 igf-1 and growth hormone things like
4549.199 growth hormone Itself by prescription if
4552.199 and only if it's prescribed by a doctor
4554.179 of course and is safe for you that's
4555.92 when you start getting into really
4557.719 significant increases in growth hormone
4559.699 not a lot of supplements out there to
4562.159 increase growth hormone potently now
4564.38 it's a different story when you start
4566.12 thinking about and talking about
4567.82 testosterone and free testosterone and
4570.38 luteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone
4572.48 is released from the pituitary which is
4574.82 this gland
4576.02 not far from the roof of your mouth and
4578.48 its nearby neighbor the hypothalamus is
4581.06 a collection of neurons that sits above
4582.62 the roof of your mouth and talks to the
4584.36 pituitary talks to it through neural
4586.34 connections and hormone-based
4587.96 connections there is a hormone called
4589.82 GnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone that
4592.94 is released from the hypothalamus into
4594.44 the pituitary it stimulates the release
4597.02 of luteinizing hormone or LH which then
4599.659 travels in the bloodstream to impact
4601.64 multiple tissues in the body but mainly
4603.62 the ovary in females and the testes and
4605.48 males to stimulate estrogen production
4607.94 and testosterone production there are
4610.46 supplements that can potently increase
4612.08 GnRH
4614.0 and or luteinizing a hormone and then
4616.58 indirectly increase testosterone and
4618.56 estrogen and I always like to remind
4620.42 people testosterone and estrogen are
4621.98 present in both males and females okay
4624.26 and both are important for things like
4626.3 libido muscle growth
4628.76 and so on a lot of people think that oh
4630.86 in males you know having very high
4632.239 testosterone and low estrogen is
4634.159 actually ideal it's actually not ideal
4636.02 if you want to keep your libido anything
4637.82 that lowers your estrogen too far is
4640.28 going to reduce your libido you don't
4642.199 want estrogen too high but you also do
4644.179 not want it too low so supplements that
4647.239 can tickle this pathway or actually can
4650.06 act as a bit more of a directed hammer
4652.28 on this luteinizing hormone pathway may
4654.5 also impact GnRH are things like fedojia
4659.0 agrestis this is an herb
4661.159 that I've talked about before on the
4662.84 podcast that when taken at dosages of
4666.08 600 milligrams per day many people not
4669.14 all report elevated levels of libido
4671.84 elevated sperm production elevated
4674.92 testosterone in some cases elevated
4677.36 estrogen a bunch of hormones Downstream
4679.64 of luteinizing hormone now are you going
4682.04 to be a fedojia agrestis responder or a
4685.1 non-responder there's simply no way to
4687.26 know except by trying it if you are
4689.78 going to go down this route
4691.699 there are two very important
4693.14 considerations first of all there's a
4694.699 fairly extensive literature on the fact
4696.92 that fidoji agrestis can be toxic to
4700.58 testicular cells and perhaps other cells
4702.679 when taken at very high dosages so
4704.6 obeying the particular dosages of
4706.94 fedogio aggressus that are recommended
4708.679 on various product labels and cycling
4712.159 for doji Augustus can be important some
4715.219 people need to cycle it eight weeks on
4717.38 two weeks off other people opt for 12
4719.9 weeks on a month off I know a few people
4722.659 who have taken it continuously with no
4724.58 issues but I do want to suggest caution
4728.06 when taking fidochio agrestis
4730.76 the cautionary notes are stay within the
4733.34 recommended dosage ranges you can go
4735.08 lower but certainly don't go higher and
4737.36 I think it is wise to cycle every eight
4740.0 weeks or so to come off it for two weeks
4742.82 and then going back on if that's your
4744.62 choice if you feel it benefited you
4747.08 or taking it for 12 week periods of time
4749.48 and then cycling off for a full month
4751.28 before repeating again
4754.76 the best way to know whether or not
4756.32 fedojia or any of these other
4758.0 supplements is impacting your hormone
4759.5 levels in the direction that you want
4760.88 and not impacting your hormone levels or
4762.8 other aspects of your biology in ways
4764.36 that you don't want is from a blood test
4766.46 there is simply no better tool to
4769.28 evaluate whether or not these
4771.38 supplements are working to support your
4773.0 hormones in the ways that you want and
4774.739 not causing issues
4776.239 except to take a blood test this podcast
4778.4 has inside tracker as a sponsor that can
4782.06 do in-home blood tests and give you
4783.44 blood panels there are other sources of
4785.659 blood tests that are quite good as well
4787.82 of course and in the first episode of
4790.219 The huberman Lab podcast that I did with
4791.9 Dr Kyle Gillette again a medical doctor
4794.3 expert in hormones diabetes and various
4797.239 other aspects of medicine he described
4799.64 and it is time stamped how to stand the
4802.34 best probability of getting your
4803.54 insurance to cover a blood test how to
4805.64 talk to your doctor about getting a
4806.96 hormone panel and so on so I'll refer
4809.0 you to that episode for that but blood
4810.679 tests are going to be very important I
4813.08 recommend taking them before adding in
4815.6 any supplement to increase
4817.76 hormones of any kind or decreased
4819.56 hormones of any kind for that matter and
4821.36 then again after about four to eight
4824.36 weeks of taking that particular
4825.8 supplement in order to evaluate whether
4827.659 or not it worked and whether or not it
4829.699 had any negative effects that you would
4831.679 like to avoid
4833.06 I also wanted to remind people of the
4835.04 dosage conversation that we had earlier
4837.08 just because there's a recommended
4838.58 dosage of fedogio agrestis of say 600
4840.679 milligrams per day
4843.199 first of all that is not an invitation
4845.06 to take twice as much and expect twice
4846.92 the positive effects that is not a good
4849.02 approach especially with something like
4850.84 fedogiograstis which can at high dosages
4854.659 be toxic but it's also important to
4857.78 perhaps consider taking a lower dosage
4859.58 and seeing how that affects your
4860.719 hormones
4861.8 that approach requires a bit more
4863.239 patience I know most people are thinking
4864.56 I want the effect and I want it now but
4866.719 I think it's very important when
4868.1 thinking about exercise your nutrition
4869.719 or supplementation to really play the
4871.76 long game to think about what's going to
4874.46 work for you in the immediate end in the
4876.5 long term and to ease into any kind of
4878.6 supplement regimen for instance by
4880.34 taking one thing at a time varying One
4882.86 supplement out and One supplement in
4884.36 starting at minimal effective dose and
4886.64 build up your protocols over a year or
4889.34 several years it really can be
4891.02 beneficial I can say for myself I
4892.76 started exploring the supplement space
4894.62 and taking different supplements in
4896.659 different combination
4898.04 and alone evaluating which ones worked
4900.679 and did not work for me some were
4902.239 absolutely dreadful for me I have tons
4904.4 of stories about supplement fail some of
4906.26 which were just kind of innocuous
4907.699 meaning they were a waste of money which
4909.62 isn't innocuous but at least it wasn't
4911.06 detrimental to my health other
4912.679 supplements which fortunately don't
4914.0 exist on the market anymore
4916.04 um I think actually uh were quite
4918.14 dangerous and I feel lucky that I did
4919.94 not experience even greater negative
4922.159 effects from them other supplements have
4923.78 been tremendously useful for me and for
4926.06 other people for things like sleep and
4927.92 hormone support focus and so on so for
4930.739 Doja gracias is a good example of a
4933.44 supplement that is known to have potent
4935.659 effects but you need to approach it with
4937.94 the appropriate um I would say respect
4940.94 for the fact that the dosage ranges in
4942.679 which it works
4943.94 um have to be kept pretty narrow without
4946.64 causing issues
4948.739 it does increase luteinizing hormone and
4951.86 thereby testosterone and estrogen so if
4954.38 you're somebody who's already
4955.219 excessively high in one or the other
4957.32 it's going to be very hard to just
4959.12 direct it to only testosterone or only
4961.82 estrogen now the topic of today's
4963.62 episode is not about fedoji Augustus per
4966.8 se I highlight it because it is one of
4969.02 the more potent
4970.52 supplements for sake of hormone
4972.38 augmentation but it's still fairly
4974.179 Broadband it's a little more specific
4975.92 than something like shilaji but it's
4978.8 still fairly Broadband in terms of
4980.48 hitting multiple endpoint hormones
4982.88 testosterone and estrogen and maybe some
4984.62 other hormones as well
4986.6 there are other supplements in
4988.699 particular Tonga Ali which is known to
4991.82 for instance increase libido whether or
4994.46 not it does that by way of augmenting
4996.38 dopamine related Pathways or
4998.54 testosterone Pathways still isn't clear
5000.34 it is known to increase free
5002.98 testosterone by reducing sex hormone
5007.3 binding globulin
5009.159 Tonga Ali can be beneficial both for men
5012.64 and for women
5014.14 in dosages anywhere from 200 milligrams
5016.48 to 600 milligrams per day so there I
5019.12 would say scale according to body size
5021.219 although start with the minimum amount
5022.719 and find the minimal effective dose for
5024.76 you again blood work is going to be the
5026.5 most effective way to determine what's
5028.3 working or not working at the level of
5030.46 objective numbers but subjective
5032.679 experience matters too you know if you
5034.42 take it at 400 milligrams for four weeks
5036.699 and you don't notice any effect you
5038.38 might try it at 600 milligrams but not
5040.36 higher and if you still don't see an
5043.659 effect well then it doesn't appear to
5045.52 have worked for you other people
5046.6 experience dramatic effects from things
5048.28 like fedoja and Tonga Ali why would that
5050.5 be the case well if you look to the
5052.42 scientific literature what you find is
5054.52 that the studies that report the biggest
5056.8 effects of any supplement usually start
5059.32 with a population that somehow
5061.36 diminished or back on its heels in one
5063.4 particular Dimension so for instance
5065.02 people that are hypogonadal that are not
5068.14 making enough testosterone or free
5069.64 testosterone in fact their levels are
5071.14 very very low they're subclinical
5074.08 off range in terms of the charts
5076.78 below the normal
5079.06 well those people when they take
5080.62 supplements like Tonga Ali fedoja tend
5082.719 to experience greater effects because
5084.1 they're starting from a lower level than
5085.9 people who perhaps are close to the
5087.52 optimal levels achieved through either
5089.5 age genetics exercise nutrition or some
5091.96 combination of those so that's an
5093.76 important thing to think about these are
5094.96 called floor effects and sealing effects
5097.48 ceiling effects are for instance if an
5099.88 individual already has very high
5101.32 testosterone and free testosterone and
5103.54 they take a supplement to increase it
5104.92 further they might not see any increase
5106.42 whereas somebody who sits more in the
5107.86 middle to low range stands to experience
5110.199 a much greater increase in fact one
5113.32 individual I know who took Tonga Ali
5115.98 admittedly on my recommendation his
5118.78 testosterone was initially very low and
5121.0 he was having a number of different
5122.02 symptoms he did blood work he that's how
5125.08 he knew it was low and he then took
5127.659 Tonga Ali and fedoja in combination
5129.76 because he decided he just wanted
5131.62 results he didn't care which What which
5134.199 thing was going to give him the results
5135.28 and he experienced big increases in
5137.62 testosterone this would be not free but
5139.84 total testosterone of he experienced as
5141.76 much as 600 nanograms per deciliter
5143.679 increase from where he was before which
5145.239 is very dramatic it was a near tripling
5147.219 of where his testosterone had started
5149.86 off to where he ended up I don't know if
5151.9 he's ever done the experiment of
5152.98 removing fidojia or Tonga to find out
5154.84 which one it was and this is why many
5156.219 people just take them in combination and
5157.84 if you have the budget for it and you
5159.58 are interested in just finding what
5161.26 works but not isolating what works at
5164.679 the level of single ingredients that
5166.179 would be the approach I recommend
5167.92 however again I think most people do
5170.5 well to figure out which specific
5171.639 ingredients are going to work best for
5173.199 them by isolating the variables the way
5175.179 I've described repeatedly throughout
5176.62 this episode to my knowledge Tonga Ali
5178.54 does not need to be cycled meaning you
5180.1 don't have to take periods of time off
5181.54 from it I should note that the effects
5184.12 of Tonga Ali can take a little bit
5185.38 longer to experience so perhaps blood
5188.32 work should be done 8 to 12 weeks after
5190.3 initiating the Tonga Ali protocol
5192.699 as opposed to earlier and it does seem
5195.82 to have sort of cumulative effects on
5198.46 libido and that points to the likelihood
5201.639 that it's having some impact on neural
5203.44 Pathways as opposed to hormone Pathways
5205.42 hormone Pathways can be slow but in
5207.04 general
5207.88 neural pathways are the ones that are
5209.92 going to explain slow Rising shifts in
5212.56 any kind of physical or mental aspect
5214.659 that then remains stable over time so
5217.6 the exact effects of Tonga Ali and where
5220.659 meaning where they arise in the brain
5222.94 and body aren't known I will provide a
5224.679 link to a really beautiful review
5226.54 article that covers the literature on
5228.52 tonganali this came out fairly recently
5230.32 and that I've reviewed with a number of
5231.88 other
5233.38 um MDS and medical or medicine related
5237.159 podcasters it's a really nice review
5238.9 I'll provide a link to that gives a
5240.699 survey of Tonga Ali what people are
5242.32 discovering what they're finding what
5243.58 they're not finding and so forth as a
5245.32 final note on supplements for hormone
5247.12 augmentation and supplementation I want
5249.28 to make a brief mention of something
5250.78 specifically related to female Health
5252.94 which is of course the menstrual cycle
5254.62 and across the menstrual cycle different
5256.06 hormones are present at different levels
5257.5 follicle stimulating hormone is very
5259.6 high during the so-called follicular
5261.1 phase right and then you have your
5262.659 luteal phase we have an entire episode
5265.0 coming up about female hormones and
5266.86 Hormone Health that will cover this we
5268.6 also covered a little bit of this in the
5270.52 other episodes on testosterone and
5273.34 estrogen but the point I'd like to make
5275.44 now is that for women
5277.659 they should fully expect that certain
5279.76 supplements not all but certain
5281.02 supplements because of the way they
5283.06 impact different hormones would have
5285.4 different effects maybe even opposite
5287.32 effects at different phases of the
5289.06 menstrual cycle and for that reason I
5290.92 believe it is especially important
5293.5 to have tight control over dosage and
5297.28 individual ingredients in your
5298.6 supplement regimen so for instance if
5300.28 you're somebody who takes Sheila Gene I
5302.26 know many women who take Sheila G or
5304.06 Tonga Ali
5305.62 for instance or Maca and you find that
5308.5 it really serves you well that is it
5310.48 provides the mental and physical
5311.5 benefits that you want and enjoy
5314.32 at certain phases of your menstrual
5316.12 cycle but at other phases of your
5317.739 menstrual cycle it feels like too much
5319.36 or it actually can start to give you
5320.739 negative mental or physical effects well
5322.78 then obviously having control over those
5324.699 specific ingredients is going to be
5326.679 extremely important so that you can
5329.26 titrate the dosage or increase the
5331.36 dosage as the case may be or cease
5333.46 taking those things entirely at certain
5335.38 phases of your menstrual cycle
5337.3 that's not to say that some women can't
5339.219 just continuously take these supplements
5340.9 throughout their menstrual cycle some
5342.28 can but some find that that makes them
5345.219 very uncomfortable or that they would do
5347.139 well to alter different ingredients at
5349.6 different phases of their cycle so again
5351.219 this speaks to the critical importance
5352.96 of single ingredient control dosage
5355.9 control and the ability to cease taking
5358.12 individual or multiple ingredients
5359.98 according to the backdrop of your health
5362.139 generally and obviously the menstrual
5363.639 cycle is a profound shift in the
5365.739 hormones and thus the entire biological
5368.5 and psychological milieu that exists in
5370.719 the body and of course there's the issue
5372.639 of birth control and whether or not
5374.02 people are taking hormone-based birth
5375.4 control certain forms of hormone-based
5377.739 birth control and women involve
5379.6 tonically elevating that means
5381.159 consistently elevating estrogen that's
5383.62 certainly going to reduce the
5385.42 fluctuations and thus the probability
5387.88 that certain hormones and hormone
5389.26 Pathways will change across the
5390.4 menstrual cycle but not eliminate it
5391.9 altogether also there's the key issue of
5394.84 fertility in both males and females one
5397.239 important note even though this is not
5398.98 an episode about fertility we're going
5400.9 to have one soon but the important point
5403.42 about fertility is that there are
5405.4 supplements not just Sheila G but there
5407.08 are supplements and supplement protocols
5408.639 such as
5409.84 L-Carnitine in particular injectable
5412.06 L-Carnitine which does require a
5413.739 prescription at least in the US but also
5415.36 orally ingested L-Carnitine that can
5418.3 improve sperm health and motility and
5420.34 egg health and motility I mentioned that
5421.78 earlier
5422.679 but if couples are trying to conceive
5425.98 it is important that if you're going to
5427.96 take something that is a supplement
5429.76 directed towards sperm and or egg Health
5432.3 that you also consider how that
5434.739 interfaces with some of the other
5436.239 hormone-based
5437.62 compounds that is prescription drugs
5439.42 that you may be taking this is true for
5440.739 people who are doing IVF in vitro
5442.6 fertilization or not
5444.34 again that entire discussion will be
5446.8 handled in our episode on fertility and
5449.139 on female hormone health and we already
5450.639 did the episode with Dr Kyle Gillette on
5452.98 male hormone Health optimization the
5455.139 next category of supplementation that
5456.699 I'd like to address is supplements
5458.08 related to cognitive enhancement and
5460.0 focus and here there are a number of
5462.34 very useful strategies that one could
5464.139 take I'd like to divide this
5465.88 conversation into two general categories
5468.28 of supplements to address cognitive
5469.96 enhancement and focus the first category
5472.62 are supplements that increase energy by
5475.96 way of stimulant properties so the most
5478.96 obvious of these is caffeine caffeine is
5482.5 of course a molecule that can increase
5485.739 levels of alertness it also can increase
5487.78 levels of focus provided that dosages
5490.06 are in the appropriate range the
5493.06 appropriate range in most cases is going
5495.1 to be one to three milligrams per
5496.6 kilogram of body weight taken
5499.48 30 minutes or so before any kind of
5502.179 mental or physical Endeavor we did an
5504.28 entire episode about caffeine where you
5505.78 can learn lots of facts about caffeine
5508.36 how best to utilize caffeine and indeed
5510.52 I'll just give you a few of those now
5511.659 turns out that if your regular caffeine
5514.0 user you can still derive the cognitive
5517.42 enhancing and focus enhancing effects of
5519.82 caffeine if you ingest caffeine every
5522.4 day but if you were to take two days off
5525.82 from caffeine completely and right now I
5527.739 hear all the caffeine addicts out there
5529.62 just kind of cringing at the idea and
5532.96 then take caffeine in the 30 minutes
5535.239 prior to some especially important event
5538.12 physical or mental event where you
5539.8 really need to focus and be able to
5541.78 sustain that Focus for long periods of
5543.34 time it would have an even greater
5545.02 effect than it normally would but since
5546.82 most people are taking caffeine in a
5548.44 kind of ongoing regular way I just want
5550.9 to emphasize that it still has Pro
5552.82 cognitive and pro-focus effects even if
5555.639 it's taken every day or even multiple
5557.32 times per day again a cautionary note
5559.54 don't drink caffeine too late in the day
5561.28 past 2 p.m it can really start to impede
5563.8 uh your sleep at night even if you can
5566.139 fall asleep at night the architecture of
5567.52 that sleep is not going to be great if
5569.199 you're ingesting caffeine in the
5570.639 preceding eight to ten and even 12 hours
5573.04 and that actually raises another
5575.04 tangential but still important point so
5577.06 I'm going to make it and then get back
5578.98 to supplements which is the best
5580.96 cognitive enhancer that you will ever
5582.88 take is a really good night's sleep of
5586.179 sufficient duration okay so sleep is
5589.12 going to be the Bedrock of your ability
5591.88 to focus and remember things in fact
5594.04 it's during sleep that neural
5595.54 connections remodel so-called
5597.659 neuroplasticity it's actually not when
5600.159 you trigger learning but it's when you
5601.54 consolidate and reinforce learning and a
5603.88 number of other things that relate to
5605.08 cognitive enhancement and focus the
5607.12 other thing of course is that you're
5608.86 going to need to have sufficient levels
5611.679 of nutrition so you don't want to be
5613.659 overly hungry or it's going to be hard
5615.28 to focus nor do you want to be
5616.96 overloaded with calories or a volume of
5619.48 food or have your blood glucose to be so
5621.639 high that it's going to make you sleepy
5623.44 there's a reason why when discussing
5625.96 stress and the so-called autonomic
5628.179 nervous system that the phrase rest and
5629.86 digest comes into play rest and digest
5633.52 as the name implies relates to the fact
5636.88 that when we have
5638.38 a lot of food in our gut it tends to
5640.96 make us sleepy in other words it's hard
5643.3 for us to focus and it's hard for us to
5645.46 maintain cognitive attention and
5646.78 remember things Etc so there are a bunch
5649.179 of Behavioral tools for enhancing Focus
5650.679 we did an entire episode on enhancing
5653.02 focus it does touch on supplementation
5654.76 again you can find links to that in all
5656.739 formats at hubermanlab.com we also have
5659.139 a newsletter related to this topic also
5661.239 at hubermanlab.com at zero cost
5663.88 with all of that said and in particular
5666.1 the Highlight about sleep being the best
5667.78 way to enhance your cognitive abilities
5669.88 and focus anytime we're having a
5671.739 discussion about supplements for
5673.179 enhancing cognitive ability and focus a
5675.699 major category of those supplements is
5677.199 going to fall into the stimulant
5678.58 category and that's going to include
5681.639 most often caffeine although there are
5684.04 other sources of stimulants I'm not
5686.739 going to touch on those for the moment
5687.94 just talk about caffeine when people
5689.92 hear caffeine they think well I can just
5691.48 drink coffee and indeed that's a great
5692.86 source of caffeine so is yerba mate I
5695.679 would caution people to
5697.3 um if you're going to use yerba mate for
5698.92 whatever purpose caffeine or otherwise
5700.719 that you avoid the smoked versions of
5703.659 yerba mate they are carcinogenic that is
5706.54 the smoked versions or carcinogenic I
5709.12 know and to consume the non-smoked uh
5711.88 varieties
5713.02 um instead the important thing to
5715.96 understand about caffeine is that while
5718.06 it can be ingested in the form of a
5719.98 drink or an energy drink to your coffee
5723.88 it can also be ingested as a pure
5726.52 supplement that is there are caffeine
5728.44 supplements and I know a number of
5729.639 people including a very very prominent
5731.679 podcaster whose name I won't mention who
5734.139 drinks herbal tea but takes a 100 to 300
5737.86 milligram tablet of caffeine with the
5740.5 herbal tea so in that case it is no
5742.42 longer herbal tea it is caffeinated
5744.1 herbal tea
5745.36 when you take caffeine in pill form it
5748.659 tends to have a much more potent and
5750.699 long lasting effect than when you take
5752.739 caffeine in
5754.84 the form of coffee or tea it's actually
5757.239 a world apart in terms of its effects
5760.239 and if you haven't experienced this
5762.52 before it might be something that you
5764.56 want to explore it might not be
5766.179 something you want to explore in
5767.199 particular if you're somebody who
5768.28 experiences anxiety or panic attacks be
5770.199 very careful with your intake of
5771.34 caffeine again see the episode of the
5773.86 huberman law podcast all about caffeine
5775.719 for more on that but
5778.54 it is the case that even 100 milligrams
5781.3 of caffeine in tablet form I suppose it
5783.46 could be in capsule form as well but in
5785.02 its pure form leads to much greater
5788.86 enhancement of alertness and focus then
5792.699 does often the comparable amount or even
5795.699 twice the amount of caffeine contained
5797.44 in coffee or tea now why would that be
5799.36 has a lot to do with the other things
5801.46 that are in coffee and tea so here I'm
5804.04 not encouraging people to become reliant
5807.04 on caffeine capsules or on caffeine
5809.739 tablets but if you want to increase
5811.84 alertness and focus caffeine is a potent
5815.32 way to do that it works the other
5818.26 category of stimulant that can work in
5820.48 terms of enhancing alertness and focus
5822.699 are going to be things that increase
5825.3 adrenaline in some other way or
5828.159 epinephrine as it's also called
5830.26 adrenaline epinephrine same thing in
5832.06 some other way that are going to
5834.1 touch into or augment the so-called
5837.1 adrenergic and adrenaline systems and
5839.98 there are things like yohimbine and
5842.32 different forms of yohimbine like Alpha
5844.0 yohimbine
5845.44 um there are multiple forms of these
5847.239 things now I would go to examine.com to
5849.4 explore the different forms of your
5850.84 himbine about 10 20 years ago yohimbine
5853.239 was marketed primarily as a pro libido
5855.28 and pro-erectile agent turns out it has
5858.28 very low efficacy for both of those
5860.5 things but there are certain forms of
5862.36 yohimbine that act as stimulants
5865.06 that are effective and are separate from
5868.239 those claims and Pathways one particular
5870.58 form is called Alpha yohimbine it
5873.04 sometimes goes by the name raulstein and
5876.1 that's spelled
5879.54 r-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e again that's Alpha
5881.56 yohimbine and it's used as a stimulant
5884.32 often to also promote fat loss and
5886.239 alertness I have to say that it's a very
5888.699 potent and somewhat
5890.86 um precarious supplement some people
5893.32 experience a lot of anxiety on it that
5895.659 could also be because they tend to take
5896.98 it on either an empty stomach or in
5900.639 combination with sub caloric diets it's
5903.159 a it's sort of getting out on the edge
5904.48 of things that for some people can work
5906.58 not so well for other people they might
5909.219 actually find it to be a very effective
5910.719 stimulant in general in terms of
5912.82 supplement based approaches to increase
5914.8 cognitive
5916.179 function and focus caffeine either in
5919.36 coffee or tea form or in tablet or
5922.84 capsule form but at lower dosages than
5924.94 you would find in coffee and tea I think
5927.219 is actually a reasonable way to explore
5929.52 stimulant-based approaches
5931.54 for enhancing cognitive function and
5934.179 focus I mentioned all that not because I
5936.4 think that you probably already didn't
5937.78 know that caffeine can enhance alertness
5940.239 and focus most people already know that
5941.92 and I acknowledge that but rather as a
5943.96 contrast point for the other supplement
5945.94 based approach for increasing cognitive
5948.219 function and focus which is
5950.98 to increase certain neurotransmitter
5953.38 Pathways that are not stimulant based so
5956.98 for instance
5958.78 Alpha GPC which is essentially a choline
5961.42 donor acts in the pathways related to
5963.58 the neuromodulator acetylcholine and can
5965.86 enhance Focus so at dosages of anywhere
5968.56 from 300 to 600 milligrams people
5971.26 experience heightened levels of focus
5973.48 for sake of mental work or physical work
5976.139 the half-life of alpha GPC is about four
5979.42 to six hours so it's relatively short
5981.58 lasting although you wouldn't
5983.02 necessarily want to take it right before
5984.34 bed I don't recommend that it is not a
5986.98 stimulant it tends to enhance focus by
5989.26 augmenting acetylcholine and
5990.88 acetylcholine Pathways specifically now
5993.34 it does create a little bit of an
5994.9 increase in alertness
5996.52 so some people actually perceive it
5998.739 subjectively as an increase in
6001.5 overall stimulation but it's different
6004.38 than a caffeine type stimulant so for
6006.96 instance 300 milligrams to 600
6009.0 milligrams of alpha GPC taken alone will
6011.58 allow people to be more focused but
6013.679 doesn't tend to make people feel jittery
6015.36 or over stimulated
6017.82 similarly
6019.5 500 milligrams to a thousand milligrams
6021.9 or somewhere in between of something
6024.06 like l-tyrosine which is amino acid
6026.46 precursor to dopamine a different
6028.08 neuromodulator taken a loan or in
6031.679 conjunction with again I believe in
6033.179 separating these things out by product
6034.62 but I suppose you could take Alpha GPC
6036.84 NL tyrosine together if you had already
6038.76 tried them separately and decide they
6040.139 worked well for you then you decide to
6042.3 combine them what people tend to
6044.1 experience is that the cholinergic
6046.44 stimulation from alpha GPC and the
6049.139 dopaminergic stimulation from l-tyrosine
6052.199 or simply l-tyrosine alone or Alpha GPC
6055.56 alone leads to increased levels of focus
6058.139 without the kind of overall feelings of
6061.04 stimulant-based alertness that one would
6062.94 experience with caffeine and indeed or I
6065.52 should say of course there are products
6067.38 out there and there are people out there
6068.82 that combine all three of these things
6071.1 together caffeine Alpha GPC and
6073.26 l-tyrosine and while I'm not suggesting
6075.9 that's a good or a bad thing I would
6078.179 suggest that anytime you start to
6080.219 explore the cognitive enhancing effects
6083.52 and the focus enhancing effects of any
6085.56 supplement that you ask which ones are
6087.9 stimulants so for instance caffeine and
6089.34 Alpha human being
6090.78 which ones tend to tap more into
6093.239 neuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC
6095.94 and l-tyrosine and to separate those out
6099.719 conceptually because whereas things like
6101.94 Alpha yohim binding caffeine will mostly
6104.34 serve the role of increasing levels of
6106.08 alertness but not tightening your focus
6109.56 things like Alpha GPC and l-tyrosine
6111.8 tend to serve the role of less elevation
6115.8 and alertness but more tightening of
6117.36 focus and this of course is why people
6118.739 often stack these and take them in
6120.48 combination so I think it's a very
6122.1 important distinction that most people
6123.3 aren't aware of and I'm not here to tell
6126.0 you that the stimulant-based approach or
6128.34 the neuromodulator based approach is
6130.44 better or worse they are simply
6132.239 different from one another although I
6134.58 will say that I think it is important to
6136.08 explore them separately if indeed you're
6138.48 going to explore any of them before you
6140.88 would start to combine them in a single
6142.92 formula again individual ingredients are
6145.38 going to be the way to go in terms of
6146.76 figuring out what's best for you if
6148.86 anything some people may find that even
6151.26 the slightest bit of caffeine or even
6152.76 the slightest spit of alpha GPC or
6154.619 l-tyrosine just places them into a state
6157.86 of mind and or body that's just
6159.84 uncomfortable and not
6161.88 compatible with the kind of work that
6164.28 they want to do whereas other people
6165.659 searching myself
6167.52 regularly rely on taking 300 milligrams
6170.52 of alpha GPC it turns out more than that
6172.5 kind of doesn't work for me or it tends
6175.26 to send my mind down a pathway that I
6177.659 don't like to be in for sake of
6179.639 cognitive work but I will routinely take
6181.98 300 milligrams of alpha GPC prior to
6184.199 some cognitive work or prior to a
6185.88 workout I do often combine that with
6188.159 some caffeine not in capsule or pill
6189.659 form but rather in the form of cup of
6191.4 coffee or yerba mate and it turns out
6193.98 that for me just by way of example
6196.34 l-tyrosine is something that works very
6198.84 powerfully to elevate my level of focus
6200.82 but that I tend to crash pretty hard
6203.04 afterward and so I tend to error away
6205.38 from l-tyrosine but some people tolerate
6207.119 it really well and actually really like
6208.619 it I rely on something else for dopamine
6210.78 augmentation which is
6212.36 phenylethylamine which is a little bit
6214.26 more short lasting again I arrived at
6216.54 these protocols for myself by mixing and
6219.6 matching but mostly by trying individual
6221.699 ingredients alone before combining them
6224.58 into any sort of cocktail before taking
6226.98 them you for a workout or before a
6229.5 cognitive work bout and I suggest that
6231.42 you explore them in the same way because
6232.86 that's going to deliver you to the best
6234.659 possible protocols for you which only
6237.06 you can determine and then of course
6239.04 there's the category of supplements that
6241.02 can support cognitive function and focus
6243.3 but that also touch on other General
6245.699 functions related to brain and body
6247.5 Health such as metabolic Health mood Etc
6250.26 and the one that comes to mind here are
6252.48 the omega-3 fatty acids I've talked a
6254.34 lot about omega-3 fatty acids that are
6256.98 available in the form of foods so for
6259.08 instance fatty ocean fish there's
6261.179 certain plant-based sources for these as
6263.1 well certain algaes and things of that
6265.02 sort touched on this in the episodes on
6267.06 depression that I've done
6268.86 but
6270.0 this topic mainly comes up around the
6272.04 issue of fish oil fish oil capsules and
6274.679 liquid and this is a discussion I think
6276.3 is worth having
6277.86 early on in the episode we talked about
6279.48 foundational nutrition and supplements
6282.179 that include a bunch of different
6283.139 ingredients we touched on the idea that
6285.84 some people might have the budget to
6287.28 take one such product or any number of
6290.4 different products that combine all
6291.6 those ingredients
6292.8 I should say that for those that are
6295.5 interested in taking a supplement
6298.08 but have a lower budget than would allow
6300.659 for taking one of those General
6302.639 categories of supplements we talked
6304.739 about earlier for foundational nutrition
6306.239 that combines everything vitamins
6307.619 minerals probiotics prebiotics
6309.38 adaptogens digestive enzymes
6312.0 I do think that there's a category of
6313.8 supplements that can greatly enhance the
6316.02 probability of offsetting depression and
6318.659 maybe even improve mood directly or
6320.52 indirectly there's evidence for what I'm
6322.26 about to tell you within the scientific
6324.0 literature and or offset the amount of
6326.34 antidepressant medication that people
6327.659 need to take that's also been
6328.8 demonstrated and improve metabolic
6331.199 function cardiovascular function
6333.719 and also
6335.58 enhance our ability to do focused work
6337.5 and here I'm referring to the so-called
6339.06 omega-3 essential fatty acids in
6340.92 particular the omega-3 form of the
6343.56 essential fatty acids there's now a lot
6345.3 of data showing that ingesting one to
6348.719 three grams of EPA in particular
6353.4 in the form of either fish oil capsules
6355.56 or liquid can be beneficial for a number
6358.98 of different aspects of brain and body
6360.48 health and can enhance
6362.58 focus and cognitive ability
6365.34 this is especially true in developing
6367.92 brains and there's actually an extensive
6370.199 data out of a laboratory at University
6371.76 of California Santa Barbara talking
6373.26 about how mothers who supplement
6375.96 Omega-3s in particular the epas although
6378.3 they also need to get the dhas
6380.4 that leads to Greater brain weights and
6383.639 health of Offspring this is something we
6385.679 will definitely explore in a future
6386.699 episode likely with an expert guest
6388.679 who's doing that work in that laboratory
6390.6 at UC Santa Barbara
6393.42 the point here is that if somebody has a
6396.48 limited budget to purchase supplements
6399.54 and cannot afford a foundational
6401.88 supplement in the sort that we talked
6403.199 about earlier athletic greens are
6404.639 similar but they do have a budget that
6406.8 would allow them to purchase a high
6408.6 quality Omega-3
6410.46 fatty acid fish oil that would and to
6412.619 ingest it in quantity sufficient enough
6414.84 to get above that one gram of EPA per
6417.9 day again this is really important if
6419.52 you look at the product labels you'll
6420.96 often see you know 1500 or 1600
6423.6 milligrams
6426.06 of essential fatty acids but the key is
6429.179 you get above that one gram of EPA per
6432.6 day threshold and as high as three grams
6434.28 per day we had a guest on this podcast
6435.6 Dr Rhonda Patrick who takes anywhere
6437.76 from I believe three to four maybe even
6439.699 more grams of EPA per day for a variety
6443.46 of reasons including some of the reasons
6444.9 we're discussing now before we move on
6446.82 to discussing some of the more Global
6448.26 themes related to developing a rational
6449.94 supplementation protocol
6451.8 I do want to touch on this vast category
6454.739 of supplementation that includes
6456.36 food-based or food mimic type
6458.4 supplements so this would be for
6460.5 instance whey proteins or milk proteins
6463.44 or egg proteins or plant proteins that's
6466.26 a discussion that in and of itself
6468.06 deserves an entire episode if you want
6471.119 to understand which types of protein and
6473.58 source of proteins are going to be the
6475.8 most bioavailable the best for protein
6478.44 synthesis for recovery from exercise
6480.0 building muscle Etc I'd like to refer
6482.4 you to a segment within the episode that
6484.739 I did with Dr Lane Norton where he talks
6486.659 about total protein needs per day it's
6488.82 about one gram per pound of body weight
6492.06 per day for most people although there's
6493.739 some variation depending on activity Etc
6495.98 and the quality of sourcing of those
6499.86 various proteins is extremely important
6501.84 and that of course leads to a discussion
6504.06 about the quality and type of protein
6505.32 that would be present in a supplement
6507.42 like a whey protein supplement or casein
6509.4 which is a milk protein based supplement
6512.219 that discussion is segmented and time
6515.639 stamped in the episode that I did with
6517.5 them you can find at hubermanlab.com he
6519.36 actually pointed to some interesting
6520.56 data on potato protein as perhaps being
6524.04 a great plant-based substitute for those
6525.84 that don't want to take whey-based
6527.04 protein but the fact that whey-based
6528.96 proteins can be very useful for getting
6531.96 to and above a protein threshold for all
6535.139 sorts of reasons not just for muscle
6537.659 building although it's great for that
6539.04 but for other purposes as well
6541.56 and that's about one category of
6544.92 food-based or food mimic type
6546.6 supplements there are for instance
6548.88 branched chain amino acids there are for
6551.1 instance green tea supplements there's a
6553.679 huge landscape of this far too much for
6555.719 us to get into in any kind of
6557.88 um reasonable detail but I do want to
6560.46 acknowledge that those all exist the key
6563.52 thing to understand is that while they
6565.86 can serve a great role in providing
6568.58 replacement for meals that you perhaps
6572.04 couldn't have consumed otherwise and
6574.44 while they often are very convenient
6575.94 because you can drink as opposed to eat
6577.32 your calories I think that most people
6579.179 would agree that
6581.28 getting some significant fraction of
6583.98 your nutrition from Whole Foods is going
6586.08 to be useful for a variety of reasons in
6588.3 particular the fiber that comes along
6589.5 with it the bulk of the food that tends
6591.239 to make us feel sated
6592.8 and of course the fact that a lot of
6595.199 vitamins and minerals and other things
6596.639 that are contained within Foods as well
6598.739 as essential fatty acids in foods like
6601.08 animal-based proteins are not going to
6603.0 be present in most if not all of those
6605.82 kind of food mimic type powders and
6608.1 replacements for food another point is
6610.679 this question about
6612.199 age-related effects so for instance
6615.48 should kids be taking supplements well I
6617.76 mentioned earlier that there's some
6619.139 evidence that making sure that kids are
6620.699 getting enough omega-3 fatty acids can
6622.92 be beneficial they certainly could get
6624.3 those from food-based sources just look
6625.739 up online food-based sources of omega-3
6627.96 fatty acids and epas and you'll see
6629.58 lists there
6631.02 some people choose to supplement on top
6632.76 of that in particular in kids that are
6635.76 developing very quickly
6637.26 I regardless of whether or not they're
6639.9 consuming enough epa's from food some
6642.6 parents choose to supplement on top of
6644.28 that I am personally not a fan of
6647.639 children taking melatonin for the reason
6649.739 that melatonin is already chronically
6651.42 elevated in kids and there's a growing
6653.34 body of literature that melatonin
6655.5 supplementation in kids can be
6657.84 potentially harmful I don't want to
6659.699 create alarm among those who've already
6661.26 been taking it or giving it to their
6662.639 kids or that gave it to their kids in
6664.139 the past but I do think that melatonin
6667.56 in particular should be approached with
6668.88 a lot of caution especially for kids and
6672.3 then of course there's the issue of
6673.98 whether or not all these other
6674.94 supplements that we've discussed whether
6676.44 or not kids can take them safely and
6678.3 again it's highly individual I would say
6680.46 that for the supplements that relate to
6682.86 hormone augmentation and support
6685.739 unless your physician a board-certified
6688.5 MD specifically recommends them I would
6691.5 strongly suggest avoiding intake of
6694.32 those things until at least after
6696.48 puberty and probably in to the late
6698.94 teens and early 20s because the body and
6701.639 brain are still developing and hormone
6703.139 systems are still active even though
6704.94 puberty may happen between ages you know
6707.159 11 and 14 or even 15. puberty can be a
6710.58 long lasting event with a long taper and
6712.679 tail
6713.699 on it so you want to be cautious about
6715.76 augmenting hormones in young people
6718.56 through the use of supplementation
6719.82 unless a physician is working very
6721.619 closely with you or rather you with them
6724.139 and then in ages of say 22 years old 24
6726.78 and older I don't see any reason why
6729.9 people who are in their 50s or 60s would
6732.659 have any different protocols than people
6734.159 in their 30s and 40s except perhaps in
6736.86 the domain of cognitive enhancement
6738.3 where it might make sense again might
6740.46 provide it it can be done safely and
6742.56 with the consult of a physician
6745.32 it might be beneficial for people who
6747.179 are approaching their later years to
6748.679 consider increasing dosages or the
6750.719 variety of things and approaches that
6752.58 they take for cognitive enhancement
6754.199 because age-related cognitive decline is
6756.84 a reality there is no person that
6759.0 escapes that the question is whether or
6760.8 not the slope of that decline is very
6762.54 steep or very shallow and of course this
6765.179 is an opportunity for me to raise the
6767.159 point that I made much earlier and that
6768.96 I'll make over and over again because it
6770.58 really is the most important point to
6772.679 today's discussion which is that
6775.139 behaviors both exercise sleep making
6779.4 sure that your relationship to light
6780.96 getting sufficient sunlight early in the
6783.239 day and throughout the day if you can
6784.56 and limiting your viewing of bright
6787.26 artificial light in the late evening and
6789.659 especially between the hours of 10 pm
6791.159 and 4 a.m things of that sort all the
6793.619 do's and don'ts
6794.94 and of course cardiovascular exercise
6796.86 and resistance training exercise and
6798.54 maybe even flexibility training exercise
6800.6 topics we've covered extensively on this
6802.98 podcast and for which we'll soon have a
6805.26 special series airing with Dr Andy
6807.179 Galpin that gets into a lot of detail
6808.619 and protocol development that you can
6810.36 all employ
6811.679 all of that needs to be done at every
6814.86 age certainly past puberty in order to
6818.4 maximize cognitive function in order to
6821.639 maximize cardiovascular function in
6823.5 order to maximize focus and every aspect
6826.619 that we really all stand to and want to
6830.04 enhance when we think about
6831.06 supplementation so again get your sleep
6833.76 right do that by getting your
6835.139 relationship to light right get your
6837.0 exercise right Quality Social connection
6838.92 right and then of course there's that
6840.239 landscape of nutrition that we talked
6841.679 about extensively earlier and for which
6843.6 we have other episodes that really dive
6845.159 deep including that episode or I should
6847.56 say in particular that episode with Dr
6849.6 Lane Norton where we really took a full
6851.94 survey of the landscape of nutrition
6853.619 everything from protein needs vitamins
6855.54 minerals fiber microbiome it's a
6858.78 deep deep discussion with a lot of
6860.639 actionable takeaways if you're curious
6862.619 about nutrition and in particular if
6864.48 you're a vegan or vegetarian or
6867.36 carnivore based but even for the more
6869.58 common omnivores such as myself I found
6872.04 that to be an incredible Learning
6874.26 Journey thanks to Dr Lane Norton just so
6876.659 much useful knowledge in that episode if
6879.96 you want to learn more about nutrition
6881.159 the behavioral tools the nutritional
6883.26 tools are really going to serve as the
6885.42 primary two layers upon which your
6887.34 supplementation Protocols are going to
6889.02 rest and again I want to emphasize that
6890.639 your supplementation protocol may be
6892.92 zero supplements it could include no
6895.26 supplements whatsoever and that would be
6896.94 perfectly fine provided that you're
6898.5 sleeping as well as you want to and need
6900.179 to you're able to focus and work as well
6902.159 as you want to and need to you're able
6903.54 to perform physically as well as you
6905.46 want to and need to and you feel that
6906.6 your hormones and related functions are
6909.239 where you want them
6910.86 however for most people
6912.96 who are doing most everything right
6916.02 they want to explore how they can make
6918.6 things like their sleep their focus
6920.48 their hormone function even better and
6922.86 that's where supplementation makes a lot
6924.42 of sense and when I say it makes a lot
6926.04 of sense I mean it makes a lot of sense
6927.36 to explore in a rational and regimented
6929.699 way there are a couple of big themes
6931.32 that we've talked about a few times
6932.639 during today's podcast that I'd like to
6934.44 reiterate now because they are so
6936.239 crucial to developing a rational
6937.92 supplementation protocol the most
6940.02 important of which is unless we're
6941.82 talking about foundational nutritional
6943.8 support that is coverage of vitamins
6945.78 minerals digestive enzymes probiotics
6948.3 prebiotics and adaptogens
6951.0 we should really be focusing on single
6953.82 ingredient formulations foundational
6955.8 supplements that include all those
6957.36 things I just listed off all combined in
6959.76 One supplement are fine I simply don't
6961.8 see any other practical or reasonable
6963.659 way to get each and every one of those
6965.219 things through single ingredient
6966.9 formulations however when you want to
6969.3 start thinking about and actually
6970.739 practically exploring things like
6972.719 supplementation for sleep or Hormone
6974.58 Health or cognitive function the single
6976.739 ingredient formulations are going to
6978.0 give you the most power and control
6979.86 they're going to make sure that you can
6982.199 find the minimal effective doses that
6983.82 you can rule out things that are not
6986.1 effective for you or that may be
6988.8 detrimental for you in whatever fashion
6991.199 and it's not just about cost
6993.84 Effectiveness it's also about arriving
6996.08 at small kits or cocktails of
6998.82 supplements that you can really manage
7001.159 and work with that you're not dependent
7002.9 on but that you really feel can augment
7005.0 the various aspects of your health that
7007.04 are important to you so that's really
7008.54 what today's episode is about even
7010.34 though we had coverage of specific
7011.9 supplements and their functions in these
7013.94 different domains of mental and physical
7015.26 health and performance today's episode
7017.179 was really geared toward giving you
7019.88 resources and a framework to think about
7022.219 how to approach supplementation how to
7024.44 navigate sticking points and pain points
7026.48 in supplementation how to get the most
7029.36 out of your supplementation regimen
7030.98 without spending an excessive amount of
7032.96 money and if you don't have finances to
7036.08 allow for a lot of exploration of
7038.0 supplements how to narrow in on the most
7039.679 effective supplements the most quickly
7042.08 and derive all the benefits that you can
7045.199 from them and as a final point the that
7048.56 is redundant with a few of the themes we
7050.179 talked about today but that I don't
7051.38 think I ever really explicitly stated is
7054.44 that
7055.28 while the word supplement makes it sound
7057.44 like these compounds are something just
7060.26 to add on top of or compensate for
7062.78 deficiencies in nutrition or other areas
7064.88 of your life many of them are actually
7067.219 quite potent compounds these are potent
7070.46 non-prescription
7072.26 molecules that really can move the
7075.02 needle in terms of your ability to think
7077.06 more clearly sleep better support your
7079.58 hormone function but as always they are
7083.0 just one element within an ecosystem of
7085.76 other factors such as your behaviors
7088.219 which includes do's and don'ts such as
7090.139 your nutrition maybe even such as
7092.42 prescription drugs that you also might
7094.28 happen to be taking or hoping to be
7096.02 taking less of or removing completely
7098.599 again that has to be done in discussion
7100.34 with Physicians if you're going to do it
7101.84 at all but
7103.76 the real Point here is that what we call
7105.92 supplements are actually a powerful gear
7108.26 within a larger system aimed at each and
7111.56 every one of us customizing tools for
7113.84 our mental physical health and
