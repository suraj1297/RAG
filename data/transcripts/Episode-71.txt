0.36 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.36 where we discuss science,
3.477 and science-based tools for everyday life.
9.69 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.63 and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
13.39 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.58 Today, I have the pleasure of
introducing Dr. Samer Hattar
18.84 as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
21.64 Dr. Hattar is the Chief of the Section
23.7 on Light and Circadian Rhythms
25.62 at the National Institute of Mental Health
27.59 in Bethesda, Maryland.
29.53 Dr. Hattar has many important
discoveries to his name.
33.14 He was one of a handful
of groups that discovered
35.93 the light sensing neurons in the eye
38.49 that set the circadian clock.
40.193 This is a fundamental discovery
made in the early 2000s
44.66 that has led to an enormous
number of additional discoveries
48.17 on how light regulates our
sleep, our immune system,
52.17 our mood, mental health,
metabolism, feeding,
56.47 and many other important processes.
59.41 If ever there was somebody who understands
61.21 how all of these processes interact
63.72 and can inform best practices
for our daily behaviors,
67.64 it's Dr. Hattar.
69.18 During our discussion today,
Dr. Hattar answers questions
72.34 that are absolutely
essential for us to know
74.92 about our health and wellbeing.
76.89 For instance, how to
align our sleep schedule
80.32 with our activity
schedule, such as exercise,
82.96 and how to align light,
activity and exercise
86.75 with our feeding rhythms.
88.73 He presents a new model
of how light, activity,
93.09 and feeding rhythms converge
to support optimal health.
96.3 And when those are not aligned correctly,
99.25 how our mental and
physical health can suffer.
102.01 It's a discussion that is rich
with scientific mechanism,
105.27 made clearly, of course, so
everybody can understand,
108.3 as well as specific
protocols to deal with shifts
111.73 in day length, shifts in activity,
114.31 and in order to optimize
sleep, metabolism,
117.77 and wellbeing of various kinds.
119.65 I learned so much from
Samer as I always do.
122.28 He is an absolute wealth of
knowledge on all things related
125.66 to light and circadian rhythms,
127.34 physiology, and neuroscience.
129.36 I don't think you'll find anyone else
130.77 as knowledgeable about
these topics as Samer.
133.08 And so, I'm delighted that he
joined us here on the podcast
135.93 to share this information.
137.5 Before we begin I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast
139.94 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
142.76 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
144.78 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
147.347 and science related tools
to the general public.
150.04 In keeping with that theme,
151.02 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
154.15 Our first sponsor is ROKA.
156.13 ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
158.16 that are of the absolute highest quality.
160.48 I've spent my career
working on the science
162.21 of the visual system and I can tell you
164.22 that one of the things
that our visual system
165.56 has to contend with is
adjusting so that when we go
168.73 from a very bright area
to a dim or shadowed area,
171.3 we can still see things clearly.
173.33 ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses were designed
175.57 with the science of the
visual system in mind.
177.36 And so they make those
transitions seamless.
179.13 You always see things
with crystal clarity.
181.37 Another great thing about these glasses
182.78 is that they're very lightweight,
183.93 so you don't even really remember
that they're on your face.
186.2 And they won't slip off if you get sweaty.
189.89 The glasses were designed
initially for running
192.78 and for cycling and for active wear,
195.1 but they work great for
that and they work great,
197.87 and they also happen
to look great for work,
201.17 if you go out to dinner,
for social settings,
202.81 so they can really be worn in
essentially any circumstances.
206.0 If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,

216.86 Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
219.904 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
222.34 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
224.91 to help you better understand your body
226.66 and help you reach your health goals.
228.7 I've long been a believer
in getting blood work done
231.71 for the simple reason
that many of the factors
234.07 that impact our immediate
and long-term health
236.27 can only be detected in
a quality blood test.
239.74 The problem with a lot of
blood tests out there, however,
241.83 is you get numbers back, but
you don't know what to do
243.74 about those numbers specifically.
245.57 ROKA has solved that problem
at a number of levels.
247.89 First of all, they make getting
the blood tests very easy.
250.53 They'll come to your house if you like,
251.38 or you can go to a local clinic.
253.0 Second of all, once you
get your numbers back,
256.1 there's a very easy to use
dashboard where you can identify
260.22 obviously what the numbers are,
261.41 but also the various
things that you can do
262.85 to bring those numbers into
the ranges that you want;
265.73 through either behavioral
practices like exercise,
268.59 through nutritional practices
or supplementation, et cetera.
271.49 So they made the whole thing
very easy start to finish,
274.26 in a way that allows you to
best direct your health goals.

286.84 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Magic Spoon.
289.81 Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,
292.53 keto-friendly cereal.
294.41 I am not ketogenic,
296.23 meaning I don't follow
a purely ketogenic diet.
298.61 I tend to fast in the
early part of the day,
300.83 I tend to eat kind of low carbish
302.6 through the middle of the day.
304.1 And then in the evening
I eat carbohydrates.
305.83 That's what works best for me,
307.42 and allows me to feel alert all day long,
309.33 and to sleep really well at night.
311.85 Magic Spoon is a terrific snack for me
313.94 because it tastes terrific;
it's got some sweetness,
316.73 but it doesn't take me out of
that state that I want to be in
319.51 during the day where I'm
sort of ketoish, I would say.
322.05 I'm not actually in ketosis,
323.64 but I'm following more
or less a low carb diet
325.86 during the day, which keeps me alert.
327.7 So either fasting or low carb,
328.93 and Magic Spoon is consistent with that.
331.1 And then as I mentioned
before in the evening,
332.81 I do eat carbohydrates.
334.9 Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,
337.37 13 to 14 grams of protein,
339.07 and only four net grams of
carbohydrates in each serving.
341.89 So I think it qualifies as
low carbish or low carb.
345.7 In addition, it only has
140 calories per serving.
348.11 It's also just delicious.
349.39 They have flavors like cocoa, fruity,
351.68 peanut butter, frosted.
353.2 I particularly liked the frosted one
354.64 because it tastes like donuts,
355.75 and I particularly like donuts.
357.2 Although I try not to eat
them too often if ever.
359.96 If you want to try Magic Spoon,
361.48 you can go to MagicSpoon.com/Huberman
364.4 to grab a variety pack.
365.56 You can use the promo code

376.0 And now, my conversation
with Dr. Samer Hattar.
379.69 Samer, thanks for sitting down with me.
382.28 - My pleasure.
- Yeah, we go way back.
385.68 So, you are best known
in scientific circles
388.79 for your work on how light
impacts mood, learning, feeding,
394.29 hunger, sleep, and these sorts of topics.
397.09 So, just to kick the ball out
onto the field, so to speak,
402.81 how does light impact the way we feel?
405.64 So, when I get up in the morning,
407.78 I have the opportunity
to interact with light
409.79 in certain ways or to avoid
light in certain ways.
412.25 I have the opportunity
to interact with sunlight
414.15 or with artificial light.
416.04 Maybe you could just wade us
into what the relationship is
420.61 between light and these things
422.67 like mood and hunger, et cetera.
424.12 - Sure.
425.25 So, I mean, you do appreciate the effect
428.06 of light for vision.
429.13 So, when you wake up in a beautiful area,
432.3 beautiful ocean, light is essential;
435.29 the sunrise, the sunset, blue
sky, beautiful mountains.
440.16 So, that's your conscious
perception of light,
443.18 but light has a completely
different aspect
445.75 that is independent of conscious vision
448.41 or image forming functions.
450.4 And that's how it regulates many important
453.42 functions in your body.
454.71 I think the best that is
well studied and well known
457.98 is your circadian clock.
460.02 And the word circadian
comes from the word circa,
462.71 which is approximate and diem is day.
465.25 So, it's an approximate day.
466.62 Why is it an approximate day?
468.56 Because if I put you or
any other human being
471.15 who have a normal circadian
clock in a constant conditions
474.96 with no information about
feeding time, about sleep time,
478.94 about what time it is outside,
481.13 you still have a daily rhythm,
482.92 but it's not exactly 24 hours.
484.86 So it will shift out of the solar day
488.05 because it's not exactly 24 hours,
489.88 and hence the name circadian.
491.38 - So, just to ask a quick
question about that.
493.44 When you say you have
this about 24 hour rhythm,
497.76 how does that rhythm show up
in the tissues of our body?
502.102 - Great question.
502.935 So, it shows up at every
level that we know we studied;
506.22 it shows up at the level of the cell.
508.46 It shows up at the level of the tissue,
510.31 and it shows up at your behavior.
512.13 The most obvious for you
is your sleep-wake cycle.
515.35 You sleep and you're awake and
sleep at the 24 hour rhythms.
519.68 And if you measure the
sleep-wake cycle of humans
522.33 who are maintaining constant conditions,
524.56 you will see that the period
length of the sleep rhythm
527.04 on average is more than 24 hours.
529.64 In humans it's 24.2 hours.
531.86 So you'll be drifting .2 hours every day
535.24 out of the solar day if
you don't get the sunlight.
537.55 So the sunlight adjusts
that approximate day
541.42 to an exact day, so now
your behavior is adjusted
545.06 to the light-dark
environment or the solar day.
548.04 - Okay, so if I understand correctly,
549.64 if I were to go into a cave-
551.39 - Yeah.
- Or I would to be
552.3 in constant light.
- Yeah.
554.06 - And I didn't close my eyes-
- Yeah.
555.94 - In constant light,
that I would still sleep
559.08 in one coherent about.
- Yes.
561.387 - And I would still be
awake for more or less one
563.53 coherent about, maybe a nap.
- Yes.
565.55 - But the total duration
of my day, so to speak,
571.33 would be a little bit
longer than 24 hours?
574.39 - Perfect.
- But if I'm in a condition
576.94 like most people are where the sun goes up
578.657 and the sun goes down, and
I have some understanding
581.31 of that sunrise and sunset, then-
583.287 - You don't have the understanding,
584.18 you don't have to have
conscious understanding.
586.62 You have the detection.
- Right.
588.247 - So, circadian photoentrainment
is the word we use,
591.7 entraining the circadian clock
to the photic environment
595.3 is completely subconscious.
596.96 You're not aware of it.
598.14 It's not like vision or image forming,
600.82 where you actually know
what you're looking at.
602.9 So, it's all hypothalamic.
605.43 It's part of the brain that
is not consciously driven.
608.58 So, you actually do not
know when it happens
610.78 or when it doesn't happen.
611.75 And that's what we'll
get into when I tell you
614.18 why light affects your mood
and why sometimes people
616.75 don't know how to deal with light
618.21 to improve their mood, for example.
620.28 - Okay, so this is a subconscious vision.
622.37 - Yes.
- Okay.
624.48 Before you tell us about
how light impacts mood,
626.68 I'm curious, what is the
relevance of adjusting this clock
631.54 from a little bit longer
than 24 hours to 24 hours?
635.07 I mean, it seems like a small difference,
636.49 24 hours and 40 minutes or 24 hours.
640.04 Like what's the relevance?
642.47 I mean, why should we care
about that short difference?
644.43 - So, let's do the math.
645.44 If you shift out .2 hours a day,
647.59 in five days you're shifting out one hour.
649.56 So you're literally one hour off
652.18 in your social behavior in five days.
654.53 In 10 days, you're two hours off.
656.59 And if you're an organism
that is living in the wild,
659.62 shifting out of the
right phase of the cycle,
662.14 you could either miss food
or you could become food.
664.95 So it's really essential for survival.
667.07 I think it's one of the
strongest aspect of survival
670.63 for animals to have the anticipation
673.71 and the adjustment to the solar cycle.
676.49 - And for humans as well.
677.97 When you say animals, I'm
assuming that applies to us?
680.08 - Absolutely, yeah.
- I see.
681.8 So even though it's just a
short bit longer than 24,
686.79 if that accumulates over days,
688.35 then you could find yourself
very much out of phase
690.92 with the rest of your species essentially.
693.466 - Yeah, so let's say it's .2 hours.
695.44 So, in five days it's one hour.
697.85 In 25 days it could be five or six hours.
701.44 You could be in New
York and you're feeling
703.3 as if you traveled from
New York to London.
705.2 So, you would be having
jet lag in New York,
708.38 even though you didn't
do a jet lag travel.
710.79 So it's very important for the adjustment.
713.68 And if we have time,
maybe we could talk about
715.95 why this is important for seasonality,
717.99 because also it allows
animals to anticipate
720.66 the change in season.
722.31 And the more you're high
in the north or the south,
726.35 the more that these weather
changes occur very harshly,
730.25 and you have to be ready for them.
732.13 And that happens in us as well.
735.11 - All right, well, we will
definitely get into seasonality.
737.91 Okay, so we've got this
subconscious vision
740.59 that aligns us with the turn of the earth.
744.49 How does that work?
746.744 What is the machinery that
allows that to happen?
751.09 And how does that machinery work?
753.93 - Yeah, so, we knew that
in mammals, including us,
757.02 we are mammals, humans,
758.58 that the eyes are required
for this function.
760.55 So, if humans are born without eyes,
763.34 or the optic nerves are damaged,
765.27 humans are not able to
adjust to the solar cycle.
768.84 So we know that the eyes are required.
771.1 And since we thought we
knew about the eyes a lot
773.84 before 2000, we thought that-
775.697 - You say before the year 2000?
777.56 - Before the year 2000, yes.
- Mm hm, yep.
779.05 - We thought it's these
photoreceptors in your retina
782.7 that allow you to see.
783.69 So, in the human retinas,
785.65 there are two types of photoreceptors;
788.16 they are called rods and
cones because of their shapes.
791.4 And these rods and cones
simply take the photon energy,
794.39 which light is made of,
796.08 and they change it in a
way to an electrical signal
798.67 that allow us to build the
image of the environment
802.4 in our cortices.
- Subconsciously?
804.55 - Consciously in this situation
cause it's vision, right?
806.98 It's image forming vision,
it's a visual cortex,
810.26 and associative cortices,
which allow you to build
813.47 conscious perception of the environment.
816.34 However, people have found,
including me with the work
820.43 of David Berson and Ignacio Provencio,
822.52 that there is a subset of ganglion cells.
825.56 The ganglion cells are the
cells that leave the retina,
828.8 their axon leave the retina
and project to the brain.
831.76 So these were thought to only
relay rod and cone information
835.7 from the light environment to the brain.
838.08 We found that a small subset
of these ganglion cells
841.52 are themselves photoreceptors
that were completely
844.27 missed in the retina.
846.02 And these are the photoreceptors
848.1 that relay light
environment subconsciously
852.09 to the areas in the
brain that have and house
855.02 the circadian clock or
the circadian pacemaker,
858.1 which adjusts all the clocks in our bodies
860.55 to the central brain clock
that allows them to entrain
863.84 to the 24 hour light-dark cycle.
867.45 - Incredible.
868.283 So, as I recall 'cause I was a
graduate student at the time,
871.56 in the year 2000, there
was this landmark discovery
874.46 made by you, Ignacio Provencio,
David Berson, and others,
878.0 that these cells exists
that can communicate
880.35 day and night information to the brain.
882.21 - Yeah.
- In this very small
883.56 subset of cells.
885.46 Since then, I've heard, but
maybe you can confirm or refute
889.24 that this system that connects the eyes
892.95 to the rest of the brain
is actually the most
895.23 ancient form of vision.
896.34 That this is probably the
form of vision that some early
900.07 version of human beings had
before they had pattern vision,
903.11 before they could see colors and shapes
904.69 and motion and all that.
906.45 And that the same cells
that perform this role
911.39 are actually similar to insect eyes.
914.87 I think I heard David Berson
say once that we actually
916.99 have a little bit of
the fly eye in our eye.
919.88 What's he talking about?
- Yeah.
921.31 So, it's really interesting actually,
923.5 because these same ipRCGs we
discovered they contribute
928.11 a little bit to image formation.
929.56 And now, work from Tiffany
Schmidt specifically have proven
933.01 that they do contribute to
image forming functions.
936.3 But they contribute to very limited
940.72 aspect of image formation.
942.01 So, it fits your hypothesis that these
944.26 are an ancient photoreceptors.
945.84 The other thing that
adds to that hypothesis
948.69 is that they are expressed
in cells that don't have
950.95 any modification that make
them look like photoreceptors.
954.14 So, the photoreceptors
that I told you about
956.34 that are important for
vision, image formation,
959.83 they have very specialized
structures that allow them
963.134 to pack these structures
with photopigments;
965.82 these are the photo-detecting proteins,
969.08 so they could detect a
high sensitivity of photons
972.16 that pass through them.
975.15 These new photoreceptors don't have
978.06 these specialized structures.
980.41 So they just really need a
lot of light at the time,
984.45 we thought they need a lot
of light to be activated.
988.1 So that's why we think they are ancient.
990.09 And that's why we think they
adjust to ancient functions
993.223 that are as important as regulating
995.75 your body circadian clock
to the solar environment,
999.32 to solar day or to the light-dark cycle.
1002.21 - So, you mentioned ipRCGs,
intrinsically photosensitive.
1005.3 So these are cells that
connect the eye of the brain
1007.08 that behave like photoreceptors.
1008.41 - Right.
- Essentially.
1009.32 And then you mentioned melanopsin,
1011.73 which is the actual pigment
that converts the light
1014.59 into the electrical signal-
- Yeah.
1016.0 - More or less.
1017.57 And my understanding is that
melanopsin was identified first
1021.8 in frog melanophores.
- Yes.
1024.18 - So does that mean that
we have like little pieces
1026.12 of frog skin in our eyes?
1028.05 - So, honestly, David Berson
say you have a fly in your eye
1030.98 because it sounds better.
1032.5 The more accurate I think is that you have
1034.813 a frog skin in your eye.
1036.07 It's not as catchy, but really,
1040.0 the name melanopsin is
from melanocyte opsin,
1043.26 so it's melanopsin because it was found
1045.41 in the frog melanocytes.
1046.73 You know the frogs can change
their color depending on light
1050.32 and melanopsin drives this response.
1052.73 So when Ignacio Provencio first discovered
1055.98 these opsins in frogs,
1057.81 luckily he was smart enough
to see if they are expressed
1060.29 in the frog eye.
1061.74 They were expressed in the
frog eye and it what appears
1064.29 to be retinal ganglion
cells, which I told you,
1066.5 the one that connects
the eye to the brain.
1068.49 He had the insight to go and see
1070.34 if they are expressed in the monkey eye.
1072.6 And he found that they are
also expressed in what appears
1075.14 to be retinal ganglion cells,
1076.77 and really that what
opened the field wide open.
1079.48 Then David Berson did
the seminal experiment
1082.92 where he went to the brain
where the central oscillator,
1087.47 the oscillator that drives
circadian rhythm in the brain
1089.85 called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
1091.84 that has been known for many
years to receive retinal input.
1095.81 And he labeled the cells
that project there.
1098.34 And then he found that even
if you destroy rods and cones,
1101.32 you could get light
responses from these cells.
1103.57 So you could imagine he
nearly fainted when he saw
1107.0 that these cells can respond independent,
1109.74 completely in the absence
of rod and cone input.
1112.73 - Yeah, I'll never forget reading
1113.79 those papers in 2000, 2001.
1116.86 I was at the meeting in DC when Ignacio,
1120.309 Iggy, we call him Iggy,
1121.59 showed this image of this basically
1124.1 what is frog melanophores
1126.05 in the human eye.
- Yes.
1127.31 - [Andrew] And everyone was like,
1128.143 "oh my goodness, this is the thing."
1129.22 - Yeah.
1130.73 - And I want to get into how light
1132.66 actually can control circadian rhythms.
1134.42 In a moment.
- Absolutely.
1135.253 - But I think it's worth
mentioning now that people
1138.45 who are pattern vision blind,
1140.16 so people who cannot see
and no conscious vision,
1144.0 but have eyes, many of them
still have these cells;
1147.65 these melanopsin intrinsically
photosensitive cells,
1150.12 and can essentially match
or entrain, as we say,
1154.29 onto the light-dark cycle.
1156.04 - In fact, they possibly have no problems
1158.06 in circadian photoentrainment,
1159.43 they'll have a normal sleep-wake cycle.
1161.6 - But they're totally blind?
1162.62 - But they are totally image blind.
1164.17 And what's really interesting is that,
1166.66 and this story I heard
from Chuck Czeisler,
1168.52 so I'll give him credit,
1169.86 that some of these people
who are image blind,
1172.24 usually they get dry eyes and
they give them a lot of pain.
1175.65 And doctors used to think,
oh, since they are image blind
1179.3 and they're getting dry eye,
1180.133 why don't you just remove their eyes?
1182.11 They're not using them anymore.
1183.67 And the minute they
would remove their eyes,
1186.01 they start having cyclical
sleep problems indicating
1188.86 that now they are not entraining
to the light-dark cycle
1192.3 and are having cyclical jet
lags when their clock shifts
1196.27 through the light-dark cycle.
1198.02 - That's really interesting.
1198.97 And I hear from a number of blind people
1202.54 in my various aspects of my job,
1204.59 and a lot of them have issues with sleep.
1207.49 I think, in part because they
don't realize that they too
1210.73 need to see light at particular
times of day or night
1213.18 in order to match their schedule.
1215.36 - Absolutely.
- Well, I think
1216.27 that's a perfect segue for
us to talk about how light
1220.91 and viewing light can impact
our sleep-wake rhythms.
1224.58 And then we'll move into some
of the other ways in which
1227.44 light can impact other
forms of bodily function.
1230.38 - Yeah, so I love the way you set it up
1233.27 because one of the most
interesting and difficult aspect
1237.27 of trying to educate
people about light effect
1240.52 on subconscious vision is
that it's subconscious.
1243.79 So we're all aware of
what we think is intensity
1247.21 because we see the room,
but if you talk to people
1250.3 who know how to take
photographs and stuff like that,
1253.55 they know that the
intensities varies greatly.
1256.14 But our system, because we
have to see the same way
1259.1 in very bright conditions
and very dim conditions,
1262.15 we're not very good at
estimating intensity consciously.
1266.09 So when you try to tell
people about intensity,
1268.45 you really struggle because
they think they know intensity,
1271.58 but they really don't.
1272.71 - You mean light intensity?
- Light intensity.
1274.62 - Yeah.
- So the cones themselves
1277.22 have an incredible ability to adapt
1279.56 to different light conditions.
1281.47 So you can see at all
different conditions.
1283.52 Otherwise it'd be a disaster.
1285.18 If you don't change the
setting on your camera
1287.99 and you go from inside
the room to the outside,
1290.03 it becomes completely white,
you don't see anything.
1292.64 So if your cones don't
adapt to the environment,
1295.99 then you're not going to
be able to see in this room
1298.58 and on the beach, right?
1300.98 But the problem is your ipRCGs,
1304.21 the cells that we talked about,
1306.41 they measure intensity pretty well.
1308.58 They really know what intensity is.
1310.38 They have a very good linear
measurement of intensity.
1313.25 They don't adapt as well.
1314.9 They don't adapt actually
that much, to be honest.
1318.47 So that tells you that
subconsciously the system is used
1323.33 to measuring light intensity
in a natural environment,
1326.54 because when you are now
in the natural environment,
1328.86 you don't have industrialized lighting,
1332.12 then your system is functioning very well.
1335.53 But now when we change these environments,
1338.14 we could really mess up ourselves.
1339.66 So you have to teach people
how to understand intensity.
1343.44 And that's something that you
have to explain to people.
1345.91 And I think I love to do it myself.
1347.96 I do it in what is called
the lowest amount of light
1351.24 required to allow you to see comfortably.
1353.5 So you have to do this
as an fun experiment.
1356.45 - Okay, so explain to me how this goes.
1358.75 And maybe we could break up the day
1360.58 into three or four parts.
1362.88 So let's say assuming
that most people wake up
1365.75 in the morning-
- Mm hm.
1366.62 - As opposed to night
shift workers, et cetera,
1368.55 we could talk about later.
- Right.
1369.877 - But they wake up in the morning,
1371.5 so let's divide the day into quarters.
1373.751 What is the proper way
to interact with light
1377.05 in the first part of the day?
1379.3 - So, I honestly think the
easiest thing is waking up,
1382.88 get as much light as you can.
1385.52 - To your eyes?
- Yeah, it's really nice.
1387.5 Your system is prime.
1388.84 If you're entrained,
it's prime to get light,
1390.92 the sun should be out.
1392.68 Most animals in the wild,
1394.06 they actually seem to track the sun.
1396.32 The sun has a huge
influence on life on earth.
1398.76 It's actually life on
earth is because of sun.
1401.9 So, that's easy.
1404.07 In the morning when you
wake up, you need light.
1406.143 Just get the light.
- Okay, so what is
1407.02 the behavioral practice
that you recommend?
1410.5 Let's say somebody is in a condition where
1412.34 there's a lot of cloud cover.
- Yeah.
1413.287 - Is it important to get outside?
1415.65 - So, I have to tell you,
1416.82 the cloudiest day is going
to be much more brighter
1419.43 than your room.
1420.263 You could ask any photographer.
1422.41 A cloudy day, unless it's
really dark, dark clouds,
1425.5 usually cloudy days have
much more light outside
1428.85 than inside the room,
1429.87 even when you have good
lighting inside the room.
1432.78 So I think in the outside is
usually even when it's cloudy,
1436.999 you're going to get to enough
intensity to help you adjust
1439.75 your cycle to the day-night cycle.
1441.8 - So, how long do you...
1443.91 These are general rules of thumb,
1445.06 but how long do you
recommend people go outside?
1446.553 - So, if you do it daily,
you possibly need very few.
1449.97 If you do it daily,
because remember this thing
1452.06 is going to happen on a daily matter.
1453.547 So, let's say 15 minutes.
- So, the clock is tracking
1455.43 it on a regular basis?
- Absolutely.
1456.81 It's photon counting, it's tracking.
1459.62 I would say 15 minutes.
1460.71 If you don't do it daily,
you may want to increase it.
1463.66 And we'll talk about when you
travel, what you could do,
1465.74 but yeah, 15 minutes should be fine.
1468.02 You do it more, it doesn't hurt.
1469.87 - And through a window,
1471.41 my understanding is that through a window,
1473.21 it dramatically decreases
the amount of light energy
1475.47 coming in.
- It depends on how thick
1478.28 the windows are and how dark they are.
1480.23 So, but it's also nice to go outside
1482.58 and to feel the seasons.
1484.49 - Sunglasses off?
1486.09 - I don't use sunglasses.
1487.58 - Yeah, but you have your
Jordanian photopigment.
1490.1 - Yeah, yeah, that's right.
- You know, so, yeah.
1492.23 Whereas my eyes are very sensitive, right?
1494.38 - No, but I personally,
if I'm in the shade
1498.24 or if it's not incredibly bright,
1500.24 I try to, especially in the morning,
1501.567 but I'm also an early person.
1503.63 So we have to differentiate between early-
1504.813 - What time do you wake up?
1506.27 - I wake up at 4:30 in the morning.
1507.553 - But the sun isn't out yet.
- It's not out yet, so it's-
1510.22 - So, what do you do?
1511.053 You turn on artificial lights?
1512.16 - I usually don't turn on artificial light
1514.21 because I know the sun is
going to come up eventually,
1516.56 but that's why I don't like the change
1519.0 in the timing that they do.
1521.123 - Wait, but what do you do
between 4:30 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.?
1523.79 - I mean, I look at my computer,
1525.53 and my phone.
- Oh, I see.
1526.363 - So possibly I get enough light,
1528.005 but in reality, I mean as
long as you let your body
1532.03 get the morning sunlight,
which I think is really,
1535.86 to me and there is no evidence of this,
1537.69 but to me, if you look
at all animals, plants,
1540.9 this morning sunlight
seems to be very important.
1543.66 And we don't have experiments to show it,
1547.43 but I have a gut feeling that it
1549.29 has a huge impact on humans.
1551.71 - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab
at the Stanford Sleep Lab
1554.44 has shown that these early
morning light flashes
1557.16 can adjust the total amount of sleep-
1558.68 - Absolutely.
- That one will get.
1560.29 It makes it easier to get into sleep.
1561.462 - Absolutely, absolutely.
1563.57 And Ken Wright also did this
beautiful camping experiments
1568.27 that showed that-
- Maybe you could describe
1570.421 those 'cause those are
beautiful experiments.
1571.254 - Oh, yeah, they are
beautiful experiments.
1573.21 He took these college
students that had a late onset
1577.48 of sleep and late waking time,
1579.68 and then he said, let's go
camping and just don't use
1582.21 any artificial light and
you could go to sleep
1585.15 as late or as early as you want,
1587.81 and wake up as late or as early.
1589.33 And he found a huge shift
in their sleep pattern
1593.04 just by exposing them
to the light-dark cycle.
1595.45 I mean, so-
- And it has lasted.
1597.7 - And it lasted, yeah.
- Even after they came back.
1599.396 - Exactly.
- Those two days of camping
1600.9 reset the circadian clock?
- Seven days, but it lasted.
1603.42 Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
1604.99 Yeah, it's really incredible.
1606.8 - Okay, so get bright light
of some sort early in the day,
1611.45 ideally sunlight, even on a
cloudy day, it's going to be-
1613.69 - Absolutely.
- Brighter than indoor light.
1615.74 - So that's easy.
- Okay, so then-
1617.64 - And the other thing that
I would like to mention
1619.57 to people, if you think
it's very dim outside,
1622.42 let's say it's very cloudy, stay longer.
1624.61 So remember intensity
is only one component.
1627.35 Duration is also
important because remember
1629.39 that the circadian system is
not like the image system.
1633.01 In the image system you
have to change every second
1635.37 because you're looking
at different objects.
1637.02 You have to change your perception.
1638.843 But for the circadian system
it's trying to figure out
1642.17 where am I in the day-night cycle?
1644.97 So the more you give them the information,
1647.04 the better you are.
1648.03 So, if it's very bright,
you don't need a lot
1650.067 because it's clearly going
to make you fire like crazy.
1653.71 But if it's not bright, stay
longer, stay for one hour.
1656.99 You know, have your coffee
outside or something like that.
1659.75 It's just going to help.
1660.833 - I think you said something
extremely important,
1663.09 which is that this circadian
system is trying to figure out
1666.47 when you are in time.
- Exactly.
1668.67 - Not where you are in space.
1669.707 - Sorry, I said, where you are in time.
1670.887 - Yeah.
- I mean when you are.
1672.58 - Oh no, no, I wasn't correcting you.
1673.73 I just meant that I think
fundamentally that's
1676.426 the incredible thing about this system.
1678.91 - Absolutely.
- That you have this clock,
1681.01 this 24 hour clock in your brain,
1682.84 but it needs to be
synchronized to the outside.
1685.59 So could we go a little deeper
into this circadian setting
1689.81 behavior and come up with
some general rules of thumb?
1693.37 So, let's say it's a very bright day.
1694.867 - Mm hm, mm hm.
- Extremely bright.
1697.31 No clouds, the sun's out.
1700.98 You said 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
1702.747 - And I'll tell you if you're sensitive,
1705.08 you don't even have to go in the sun.
1706.76 You could be in the shade.
1708.16 There's going to be so many
photons out there in the shade.
1711.29 It's going to be perfect.
1712.33 You don't even have to see the sun.
1714.4 You don't have to have the sun.
1715.96 You know, it's great for vitamin D,
1717.36 that's a different story.
1718.32 You could do this for your
skin and protect your skin.
1722.21 That's not my area of expertise,
1723.82 but for that effect on
the circadian system,
1727.77 as long as you're outside in
the shade and it's sunny day,
1730.72 10 to 15 minutes should be ample amount.
1733.6 - Okay and then let's say
it's kind of overcast.
1738.07 You know, it's not particularly bright
1739.36 or there's solid cloud cover,
but obviously the sun is out,
1742.92 but it's not as bright.
1745.31 How long do you think it
would take to set the clock?
1747.2 - 10 to 15 should be sufficient.
1749.34 Stay for half an hour.
1750.52 Stay for 45 minutes.
1751.79 If it's very darker out, stay for longer.
1754.53 - Okay and if for some reason,
1756.4 one finds themselves very far north,
1758.58 and it's very, very dense a cloud cover.
1762.6 How long and at what point
should somebody consider
1766.01 using an artificial light
source to mimic the sunlight?
1770.21 - Yeah, honestly, this
is where we don't have
1772.57 a lot of information still,
because this is where
1775.88 we're going to discuss
this maybe in more detail,
1778.23 that if you put humans
in artificial conditions,
1782.06 the circadian system is
very sensitive to light,
1785.59 but in reality, in the real environment,
1788.86 light also is affecting other
aspects that are independent
1792.62 of the setting of the circadian pacemaker.
1795.3 - Okay.
- And these which we call
1796.8 the direct effect of light
on mood, for example.
1799.96 So, that is very hard to figure out
1802.16 what intensity you need to use.
1803.76 And we haven't done enough experiments
1804.937 'cause this system has been
discovered just recently.
1808.95 But I would say if you use
bright light in the morning,
1811.71 and I mean, it's hard
for me to give numbers.
1814.7 It can get complicated.
1818.12 But yeah, I mean, honestly,
if you're that far north
1821.51 and you're in the winter
and you make sure you don't,
1824.37 use these light boxes.
1825.61 I would suggest that
personally, but that's it.
1828.81 - I use, it's actually not
designed for circadian setting,
1831.75 but I have a 930 lux
light pad that I bought
1835.99 and I bought it, they're
very affordable compared
1838.41 to the dawn simulating lights.
1840.52 - Yeah, you don't need them.
1841.353 - Which are quite expensive, frankly.
1843.34 - Yeah.
- And I put it there.
1844.79 And so, just basically, when
I wake up in the morning,
1847.05 I use that until the sun comes out,
1848.85 and then I make sure once
the sun is out, I go outside.
1851.23 But I keep that thing on all day.
1853.33 And I don't know if that's good or bad.
1855.13 Is a good or bad?
1855.963 - I, honestly, I don't think
being exposed to bright light
1859.4 in the day is going to
ever be bad because really
1861.73 if you're outside in the day...
1863.8 Unless, you know, the worst
that's going to happen
1866.11 if the temperature is very high,
1867.7 your body's going to say don't
dehydrate and go to sleep.
1870.4 So you could tell actually
sometimes when it's very hot,
1874.0 the more you get exposed to bright light,
1875.86 the sleepier you feel in the afternoon,
1877.8 which is counter-intuitive.
- Mm hm.
1881.289 And that's to protect us, you
think, against dehydration?
1883.37 - I think if you think
about the human evolution
1886.07 from near the equator in between noon
1889.38 and a certain time in the afternoon,
1891.59 it would have been very
hard for you to maintain
1894.64 physiological homeostatic function,
1896.67 being active at this very
high temperature time.
1899.74 So I think napping was a way,
1902.09 that's why I think it has a
major function which is still...
1905.12 Napping was a way to somehow take you away
1907.81 from that dangerous zone.
1909.23 And maybe that's why people
in the north they say,
1912.08 in the winter we can't
wake up in the morning
1914.15 'cause they don't have this long light.
1915.73 So, they sleep more at night.
1917.32 But in the summer they say,
1918.4 we feel like we can't go to sleep.
1920.36 We have to put all these dark curtains.
1922.95 So, I think, venturing that
much up north has been...
1928.84 Came up with a problem
because evolution was used to
1931.28 a certain light environment
that was completely
1934.91 changed with a human.
1936.37 With other animals, I think
that lived there longer,
1940.22 they have come up with
very interesting adaptation
1942.75 of actually measuring
even very small changes
1946.18 in the light intensities that still occur.
1949.36 And so, even if you're near the poles,
1952.31 even though it's always light,
1953.94 but there is a change
in the light intensity
1956.11 across the day-night cycle.
1957.21 So, your system, if it's linear,
1959.06 and remember I told you that
ipRCGs are incredibly linear,
1962.87 can still measure, oh, this is
lower light than higher light
1966.529 if the organism has
the ability to do that.
1969.78 - I see, yeah, it's interesting.
1971.23 I've spent so much time learning from you
1974.56 fortunately about these cells,
1976.62 and yet I never really
appreciated until now
1979.09 how on the one hand they are
tracking the amount of light
1983.19 to understand when we are in time
1985.47 relative to the 24 hour cycle,
1987.86 but also that you keep mentioning this
1990.21 linear measurement of intensity;
1991.9 that they really are trying to figure out
1993.9 when we are in time by measuring
the intensity of light.
1996.307 And of course the sun is
the most intense source
1999.0 of light available to us.
2001.05 So, okay, so I think we've nailed down
2004.22 that first part of the day.
- Exactly.
2005.97 - Basically it's get 10 to 30 minutes
2007.63 depending on how bright it is,
2009.05 and try and do that as often
as possible to give the system
2012.22 a regular source-
- Daily is the best.
2013.283 This system is really about,
2016.13 and you'll see that even for
the effect on depression,
2018.49 it's about multiple days it is.
2020.61 So you don't have to worry
if you missed it one day,
2023.61 stay longer if you want.
2025.17 But if you're in a hurry and
you want to do other stuff,
2028.17 that's a great recommendation.
2029.36 - Mm hm, so you might want to
compensate with some extra time
2032.02 if you missed a day or two.
- Absolutely.
2033.77 - And this is why I've
heard you say before,
2035.92 it's entirely possible to
get severely jet lagged
2038.97 without traveling.
- Absolutely.
2040.77 - Simply by staying in,
being on your phone too much,
2043.04 not getting the sunlight.
- Absolutely.
2043.937 And you saw this during the pandemic.
2046.1 A lot of people mentioned that their
2047.73 sleep-wake cycles suffered a lot.
2050.81 Because if you're not going
out and if you're staying
2053.79 at home and you don't have big windows
2056.42 and you're waking late, waking up late,
2058.77 and then you're using very
bright light too late at night,
2061.56 your body is going to shift.
2063.21 And now, your day is going
to start instead of like
2066.38 really when the sun comes up,
2067.62 let's say at six o'clock in the morning,
2069.99 so your day is going to start
at 11 o'clock in the morning.
2072.12 That's what your body's going to think
2073.7 is the beginning of the day.
2075.82 So, then you're not
going to be able to sleep
2078.41 at 10 o'clock at night,
2079.74 because now that's really for your body,
2083.113 it's completely different timing.
2085.39 And you could see this
happen during the pandemic
2088.06 at a very high scale.
2089.81 People get delayed in their
sleep-wake cycle a lot.
2092.72 - And there is this idea of chronotypes,
2094.833 that we all each intrinsically
have a best rhythm
2099.15 of either being a morning person.
2101.093 - Absolutely.
- You called yourself
2101.926 an early person, or a night owl,
2103.78 or more of a kind of
standard to bed around 10:30,
2106.91 up around 7:00 type thing.
2109.081 And I think there are now good data,
2111.3 correct me if I'm wrong,
2112.87 from the National Institutes
of Mental Health and elsewhere
2115.09 showing that the more we deviate
from that intrinsic rhythm,
2119.16 the more mental health issues
2121.26 and physical health
issues start to crop up.
2123.15 - So, there is great data on this,
2124.95 and there is a couple of
things that complicate this.
2127.16 The first is the people
who usually are late,
2130.53 they tell you that the
society doesn't accommodate.
2133.084 - By late, what do you mean?
2134.94 People that wake up late
and go to sleep late?
2136.1 - Go to sleep late and wake up late.
2138.146 They have an overwhelmingly higher level
2141.01 of depression and failures.
2143.51 I mean, clearly, I mean,
2144.69 the reason the people say
sleep early, wake up early,
2148.437 you're better because
human notice that people
2151.57 who go to sleep early and wake up early,
2154.31 they do better in life.
2155.46 They notice that.
- They just perform better?
2157.36 - They perform, but the question is,
2158.9 is that intrinsic to the
system or is that society
2162.45 because society start things
usually early or late?
2165.09 That's a hard question to ask-
2166.04 - We discriminate against late risers.
2167.94 - In a way, we discriminate, right?
2169.64 But the other explanation
is Ken Wright's experiment.
2173.5 These late riser, if they were
truly chronotypically late,
2178.13 why would they shift so easily
when you put them in the...
2181.73 If you were really chronotypically late,
2183.93 and there is a phase relation between
2186.19 the light-dark environment
and your circadian clock,
2188.83 then doing this camping
experiment should not have caused
2191.6 much changes because it's not
that light is going to affect you
2197.28 in a certain way, it's that
this is the relationship
2199.57 that your body decided that I'm
a late sleeper, late waking.
2203.82 So, I'm honestly, I'm
still unable to figure out
2208.14 how much of this late
waking up is controlled
2211.03 by the light environment
and how much is intrinsic.
2213.82 I'm sure there are differences,
2215.85 but are they as big as we
see in the environment?
2218.58 Because you have people that
go off to sleep a 7:00 p.m.
2222.89 and wake up at 1:00 a.m..
2224.13 These are clearly advanced phase-
2226.21 - So people that go to sleep at 7:00 p.m.
2228.02 and wake up at 1:00 a.m.?
- Yeah.
2229.4 - And feel good doing that?
2231.07 - I'm not so sure they feel good,
2232.76 but a lot of the time you talk to people,
2234.8 they say they are high achievers,
2237.06 but they suffer because
they go to 7:00 p.m.,
2240.36 wake up advanced phase sleep syndrome.
2243.732 They call it a syndrome,
but then you have people
2247.39 who would not be able
to sleep till 5:00 a.m.,
2249.937 and not be able to wake
up till 3:00 p.m., right?
2253.6 And I'm not so sure that
the circadian system
2255.92 is that variable in the human population.
2258.15 I mean, clearly there are
maybe some genetic factors
2260.76 that make a small percentage
of like everything
2263.87 with the bell shape.
2265.46 But I think most of the time,
2267.15 the light environment may play a role.
2269.14 And once, as we've talked about,
2271.5 this as a long-term effect of light.
2273.84 Once you get into a rhythm,
and I don't mean it as a pun,
2277.42 in reality, once you get into a rhythm,
2279.44 it's hard to break out of that
rhythm because if you start
2282.78 sleeping late and waking up late,
2284.84 you're not getting the morning sunlight.
2286.8 - Right.
- And so,
2287.94 you're just going to be late.
2289.65 And if you're like me waking up early,
2291.98 you're getting the morning sunlight.
2292.907 You're getting what Zeitzer said...
2296.53 I said his last name wrong.
2299.46 The one in Stanford who did the-
2301.06 - Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah.
- Zeitzer, yeah.
2303.57 - [Andrew] He actually worked for-
2305.556 - Zeitzer, yeah.
- Zeitzer.
2306.389 So, Zeitzer and Czeisler.
- Yeah, it's confusing.
2307.55 - Yeah, there are a lot of
zz's and i's in their names.
2310.47 - Yeah.
- Both phenomenal scientists.
2311.93 - Yeah.
- What it seems to me
2314.6 is the case is that the
only way to really know
2318.32 if you're meant to be an
early bird as they call it,
2321.36 an early person or a late person,
2323.53 or somewhere in between is
to get morning sunlight,
2326.27 and figure out whether or not
that makes you feel better.
2328.26 - And to understand,
2331.54 to be educated about how
to measure intensity.
2334.727 "How to measure" I put in quotation
2337.21 'cause you either get a measuring device,
2339.77 but you cannot depend on your
eye to measure intensity.
2343.729 - Okay, so how do we do that?
2344.562 'Cause you keep coming back to this.
2346.367 So, that tells me that it's important.
2348.186 - It's very important.
- So, obviously,
2349.26 so there are apps, free
apps like Light Meter,
2352.86 where you can walk around
and hold the button down
2354.61 and see how many lux
are in the environment.
2358.03 - These are complicated
because you have to point them
2360.09 to specific regions.
- Right.
2361.26 So, how do people start to
develop an intuitive sense
2365.13 of the measurement of intensity?
2367.32 - Yeah, I think at one
point I posted on Instagram,
2370.94 how I keep my nighttime at home.
2373.57 And I found out that my
night vision is very strong.
2376.96 So I found out that I,
especially in the winter,
2379.67 I only need candle lights.
2381.23 So I literally use these tea lights,
2383.327 and I put like 15 or 20 of them-
2385.86 - How romantic.
- And it's so nice.
2387.81 I could see it clearly doesn't
affect my circadian system.
2390.743 - You and your cats-
- And my wife.
2393.346 - And your wife of course.
- It's just great, right?
2395.86 But I don't expect people to have
2397.31 the same night vision as me.
2399.42 So, I mean, I tell
people, do the experiment.
2403.05 So if you put three or
four lights in your room,
2407.27 switch two, sit for 15 minutes.
2409.68 - Switch two off?
- Switch two off.
2411.23 Let's say you're using five.
2412.77 And see, after 15 minutes,
2414.63 you will not recognize you
switched these two off.
2417.4 My gut feeling is that
most people would need
2419.83 at least 10 times less light
than they use at night to see.
2424.04 The problem people use it
2425.53 because most of the time they didn't
2427.21 see the morning sunlight.
2428.32 They are actually hungry for
light without their knowledge.
2431.1 So they come switch all these lights on,
2433.06 but at the wrong time.
2434.76 Because they woke up late.
2436.22 - Okay, now I understand.
2437.854 So, this morning light
viewing goes way beyond-
2441.51 - Absolutely, absolutely.
- Setting your clock.
2443.0 It's also a way to
determine how little light
2446.35 you need later in the day.
- Exactly.
2448.262 - And we're going to talk
about this in a moment,
2450.17 but how little light
you get later in the day
2453.25 is a very strong
determinant of things like
2455.26 when you will wake up,
2456.12 whether or not you wake up
feeling refreshed, et cetera.
2458.41 Let's move-
- And that's why,
2460.29 - Yeah?
- I'm going to break it
2461.44 on your show, Andrew, that
I'm going to tell you,
2464.05 I think there is
something else that people
2466.47 do need to think about, which
is the tripartite model.
2469.58 That this model incorporate
three components
2472.37 we should talk about in
details that allows us humans
2476.2 and all animals to incorporate
the circadian clock,
2480.41 and its relation to light,
the homeostatic drive,
2484.09 and the direct effect of the environment,
2486.2 which includes stress,
light, all kinds of stuff.
2489.21 They have to be incorporated together.
2491.36 If you think, that's
what I think right now,
2493.087 if you think of one alone, you
will always miss something.
2497.848 And when you think of them as a whole,
2500.0 things really become clear.
2501.52 It's actually quite amazing.
2503.06 - Okay, well, we will
definitely want to hear
2505.58 about your tripartite
theory and go into detail
2508.73 about those homeostatic mechanisms.
2510.67 I want to make sure that for
people who are thinking now,
2514.02 I'm sure about light
and how it impacts them.
2516.91 So the morning light viewing behavior,
2518.98 I like to think we've tacked down clearly.
2521.342 - Absolutely.
- And thank you for that
2522.21 because there's so much
information out there
2523.96 and I've tried to relay that information.
2526.06 Of course, you're my primary source
2527.32 for all things circadian,
as well as Jamie and others,
2530.74 of course, and Matt Walker.
2532.06 But I think you've made
that very, very clear.
2535.98 Now, let's say I've gotten
my morning sunlight.
2539.71 Okay, great.
2540.543 Maybe my bright artificial light,
2541.65 and throughout the day you
said to get a lot of light.
2543.89 So, I'm working at my desk.
2545.05 Maybe I'll go out during
the day a few times,
2547.9 but I'm working at my
computer, I'm doing things.
2550.55 Is there anything about light viewing
2552.13 in the middle of the day that
people should keep in mind?
2555.56 Or can they just sort of freestyle it
2557.69 depending on what they're doing?
2558.58 Most people are not in a
dark room throughout the day-
2561.99 - Yeah, so my gut feeling,
2563.38 if you've got your morning sunlight,
2565.57 you walk from your car
slowly or you walk to work,
2569.74 you didn't wear sunglasses when the lights
2571.44 were still dim in the morning,
that you could freestyle it.
2575.04 That even if you don't get a lot of light,
2577.47 there is a way to just...
2580.5 In the day, you don't
have to just worry about
2582.73 getting a lot of bright light,
2583.86 but personally, I like to do that.
2585.87 So I go out at lunch and have
my lunch outside as well.
2589.72 This reminds the body that
here it is even brighter now.
2593.61 But the evidence is
that you could literally
2596.67 help your circadian clock by
giving lights at dawn and dusk.
2600.43 But again, if you think
of the tripartite model,
2602.89 this may be important
for the circadian clock,
2605.12 but is it important for your mood?
2607.94 So that's where I think you
need, or the homeostatic drive.
2611.31 So that's where you
need to think about it.
2613.68 So, for the clock, for
entraining your clock,
2616.82 you literally can entrain it
only by the dawn sunlight.
2619.85 You actually don't need dawn and dusk.
2621.91 People usually forget that.
2622.84 - Yeah and I appreciate
that you're distinguishing
2624.87 between circadian effects
and other effects of lights.
2627.283 - Yes.
- You're being very precise,
2628.84 which is appreciated.
2631.63 Until we hear about this tripartite model,
2633.68 which we will cover, for
the sake of the discussion,
2637.35 let's treat the light viewing behavior
2639.64 as what are the benefits or
drawbacks of viewing light
2644.3 for all biological purposes,
not just circadian settings?
2647.44 So, in the morning, it's
clearly going to set the clock.
2650.84 And then, during the day,
if I understand correctly,
2653.86 the idea is to get as much
bright light as you can,
2655.89 because you're feeding,
it sounds like a sort of
2658.56 light hunger.
- Exactly.
2660.74 - I see.
- I love this way to put it.
2662.27 I think there is a weird light hunger
2664.26 considering that we're not
photosynthetic organisms.
2667.71 There is a weird light hungers in animals
2669.88 that they need measure.
2673.17 And I think that relates to the season
2675.13 because the whole
reproduction cycle of animals
2678.22 is going to depend on the availability
2679.74 of food in the environment.
2682.65 And if you don't know when
the season is going to happen,
2685.29 they don't have calendars,
2687.04 it's going to be very hard to survive.
2688.73 So I think that's why we
have this light hunger.
2691.1 That's a major hypothesis.
2692.71 It's not been tested.
- Interesting.
2694.86 So, then afternoon and
evening start to approach.
2699.12 So, I've had this weird experience.
2700.8 Maybe you can psychologically
or biologically
2704.04 diagnosed me now, Samer.
2705.26 So, where if I go into a
movie in the afternoon,
2707.84 like a matinee.
- Uh huh.
2709.34 - And I come out and it's dark,
2711.53 I notice a significant drop in my mood
2715.18 and my ability to go to sleep.
2717.84 Whereas if I get some view
of the light in the evening,
2721.41 it doesn't have to be the sunset,
although sunsets are nice,
2723.94 but I get some light
pulse in the afternoon
2726.81 that I have no trouble
whatsoever falling asleep.
2729.22 - And this happens on a
single time to watch them?
2732.53 - Yeah, more or less.
- Wow, that's interesting.
2735.48 - And then you mentioned
the camping experiment
2737.3 where when they went camping,
2738.44 they're seeing the sunrise and the sunset.
2739.988 - [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm.
2741.17 - So what should people
do in the afternoon
2744.93 slash evening time in terms of
their light viewing behavior?
2748.22 - I mean, the best thing to do is to let
2750.27 the natural light creep
into darkness, right?
2753.15 That would be the best,
2754.73 but clearly that would be inefficient.
2757.11 You want to go home, you want to read,
2759.79 you want to talk to your kids,
you want to talk to your family.
2763.43 So, I think it's nice to extend the day.
2766.04 I don't think that's wrong.
2767.18 If you somehow can block that light
2770.27 from affecting your circadian clock.
2772.14 - So, should people use blue
blockers in the evening?
2775.44 - I personally do not like any blockers
2779.06 that take a single wavelength of light.
2781.01 Because again, if you think
of a holistic approach,
2784.27 yes, the blue blocker
is going to prevent you
2786.23 from affecting your
circadian clock very much.
2789.61 But then your vision is
going to be distorted
2791.76 because we always see in full spectrum,
2794.26 the sun has this
beautiful spectrum, right?
2796.9 And then when you start
seeing without the blue,
2800.32 things look yellow and it
can get really weird, right?
2803.78 I mean, so I personally,
2806.42 I've tried the blue blocker
and I couldn't even wear them.
2809.46 I thought they were just
really horrendous to be honest.
2813.04 - Well, along the lines of blue blockers,
2814.99 I think a lot of people
mistakenly wear them all day long.
2818.41 - Oh my God, that would be very bad.
2819.819 - A lot of people do that.
- That would be very bad.
2821.505 - A lot of people do that.
2822.338 They think that blue light is bad.
2824.1 I think that the-
- No, no, no.
2825.26 - The concept of blue light being bad
2827.97 led to a lot of product development.
2830.43 And a lot of people are
just assuming that viewing
2832.89 blue light is what was
giving them headaches.
2834.63 When in fact it might've just been
2835.87 looking at screens at
close distance all day.
2838.0 - So, here's the problem, right?
2839.213 I mean, the blue light
got the bad reputation
2842.12 because people who gave a pure blue light
2844.15 showed that it 'caused
a huge retinal damage.
2847.05 But again, if you're using
blue light in its pure form,
2850.46 it has a lot of energy because
it's shorter wavelength,
2853.65 but we're talking about
full spectrum light.
2856.44 There are ways now where you could change
2859.0 the spectrum of the
light and keep it white
2862.13 between day and night and
change the content of the color
2866.31 without you noticing.
2867.63 So you don't even have
to affect your vision.
2869.81 - So how would you go about doing that?
2871.53 - So, you just lower the
level of the blue light.
2873.906 You don't have to eliminate it.
2874.98 - So just dim the lights?
2876.32 - Dim the blue, then increase the yellow,
2879.26 but keep all the colors
in a certain white.
2882.9 So, you know, you could have
different warmness of white.
2886.89 And people know how to do this.
2888.29 Physicist know how to do this.
2889.69 People who work with
light know how to do this.
2891.63 - Well, maybe somebody
in the wellness slash,
2894.32 I don't like the word, but biohacking,
2895.88 or optical community will do this.
2898.287 I think it's really important,
I see so many people
2900.853 wearing blue blockers.
- They have meetings now.
2902.4 I don't know why they block-
2904.08 - Well, I think they're just uninformed.
2905.23 I think, frankly-
- Yeah and to be honest,
2907.17 it's easy, right?
2908.003 It's easier to explain
to somebody if ipRCGs
2911.305 respond mostly to blue,
remove blue, you'll be fine.
2914.1 - Right, right.
- Right?
2914.933 But that's not as simple as
that because they also receive
2917.42 rod and cone input.
2918.38 So you want to actually...
2920.05 And we could go into details,
2921.92 that's boring for your listeners,
2923.34 but it also affect the adaptation
2925.25 properties of the whole retina.
2927.17 So you don't want to
do something so drastic
2929.64 that you take just one
color of the spectrum.
2931.85 It just seems very counter
intuitive to me, to be honest.
2936.53 - You've told me before as well,
2938.64 that just because these
intrinsically photosensitive
2942.42 circadian setting ganglion cells
respond best to blue light,
2947.23 if the light is bright enough
because they also get input
2950.21 from other components of the eye,
2952.41 it doesn't matter if you block the blues.
2954.66 - Yeah.
- If you're looking
2955.55 at bright light at night,
2956.56 you're going to disrupt
your circadian cycle.
2958.01 - Absolutely and that's
why I didn't want to
2959.523 go into the boring details,
2960.93 but themselves, the
photoreceptors have a wide range
2964.05 of responsiveness.
2965.37 So they are more sensitive to blue light,
2967.4 but that doesn't mean they
don't respond to green light
2970.35 or to shorter than blue light.
2972.25 They respond to very, very wide spectrum
2975.35 with different sensitivity.
2977.05 So unless you understand the
system just removing 480,
2980.69 I don't think it's going to do-
- 480 nanometers, yeah.
2983.52 So, your home is a cave at
night basically with some-
2988.691 - It's a nice cave.
- It's nice cave.
2990.66 - Yeah.
- With candles.
2991.72 - That's right.
- Right and you and your cats-
2993.712 - And I watch TV and dim it.
- And your lovely wife.
2996.2 - Yeah.
- Who I know, who's also
2997.08 a phenomenal scientist in her own right.
2998.093 - Thank you, yeah, she is.
3000.092 - She is.
3001.89 But you do keep your home quite dim
3004.48 to dark at night?
- Yeah.
3006.16 In fact, I did go to meetings
with some of my friends
3010.11 who work on this and they
really struggled with me.
3012.32 They said we could have
broken our legs living
3014.95 in the same light environment that you do.
3017.01 So I am an extreme, but
I measured it for myself.
3020.49 And I asked, Rejji, my
wife, if she's okay with it.
3022.94 She also liked the dimness.
3024.27 Both of us can see well in dim conditions.
3027.18 And that helps us a lot,
3030.59 but I think you have to
measure it for yourself.
3032.78 You really have to...
3035.01 It's a very simple experiment.
3036.5 Just try to dim the
light as much as you can.
3039.05 I call it the minimum amount of light
3041.57 you require to see comfortably.
3044.29 - And that's how you want your environment
3046.03 ideally at night?
- At night.
3047.2 This is what I think is the game changer.
3050.0 If you reach to a level
where it's just barely,
3053.44 you're literally on the
cusp of seeing uncomfortably
3056.63 versus seeing very comfortably,
3058.83 you are going to be very much better than
3062.37 I don't like to make it completely dark.
3064.31 I think complete darkness induce anxiety
3067.55 in humans, to be honest.
3068.81 So I don't like complete darkness.
3072.26 - Kids don't like complete darkness.
3073.53 They like a nightlight.
- Even animal,
3074.793 even nocturnal animals don't
like complete darkness.
3077.6 I mean, we have studies in
animals that are nocturnal,
3081.07 that if you put them in complete
darkness for several weeks,
3083.7 they have severe anxiety
and depression like effect.
3088.29 So keep the light dim, use
red light that is very dim,
3094.03 if you want to keep the room for sleeping.
3096.81 Red light that is very
dim has very small effect
3100.31 on the circadian clock.
3103.26 And below 10 lux of red light,
3105.02 literally doesn't affect sleep at all.
3107.45 So there are ways to do it.
3109.103 It's just we need to educate the public.
3111.27 And I feel like you literally
need a whole lecture
3115.61 to just explain to the
people how to deal with light
3118.307 because it's not as
simple as people think.
3121.12 - Well, that's what we're doing here.
3122.31 - Yeah.
- We're stepping through it
3123.25 piece by piece and the
reason we're doing that
3126.375 is because it's not as simple as saying,
3128.18 just block blue light or get
a lot of light during the day,
3130.37 and minimal at night.
- I mean, just to put it
3131.287 in perspective and tell that we only have
3134.35 three different cones in our retina
3137.26 that respond to three different colors.
3140.07 We call them red cones for simplicity,
3143.16 green cones and blue cones.
3145.31 Yet we have only three of these,
3147.13 but we could see massive
palette of colors.
3150.67 So that tells you something.
3152.34 If the system was just
simply about a single color
3155.82 and us just removing 480
or just blue is sufficient,
3159.95 then we should only see
in red, yellow, and blue.
3162.46 We shouldn't see all these
different hues of color,
3165.16 but because the system is not that,
3167.42 we see all these different colors.
3169.75 And that's why it's
important to remind people
3171.99 that the white light is made
of many different colors.
3175.54 It's actually like the rainbow.
3176.99 That's why you see the rainbow,
it's made of many colors.
3179.68 White light is never truly white.
3181.64 It's made of lot of different colors.
3183.86 - It's like the Pink Floyd album cover.
3185.44 - Exactly.
- With the light coming
3186.714 through the prism.
- Exactly, exactly.
3189.54 - So, dim at night, maybe
dim red light ideally,
3193.0 or candle light.
3193.833 Find that minimum required light level.
3196.987 - Test it, just make sure
when you lower the lights,
3199.4 sit for at least 10 to 15
minutes, let your system adapt.
3203.73 Because if you had a bright
light and you switch it off,
3206.67 surely you're going to
suffer because your system
3208.7 didn't adapt yet; it was
used to very bright light.
3211.91 So you want to engage your rods,
3213.91 which take a long time to dark adapt.
3216.77 So that's why I tell you,
just wait a little bit.
3219.64 Don't just switch it off and
now I don't see, put it on.
3222.38 Put it off, sit down, wait for 10 minutes,
3224.74 ideally 15 minutes and
then see how you see.
3228.58 And then once you do that,
you will notice that actually,
3231.93 yeah, I could see quite well
even with much less light.
3237.6 - What do you do regarding screens?
3240.45 - Yeah, that's the hardest thing.
3242.52 Again, I mean, there
are beautiful programs
3245.33 that change the whole intensity
and color of the screen.
3248.74 These could help dim your screen at night
3251.07 to the lowest part.
3252.02 I mean, yes, you won't see it
3253.48 when you wake up in the morning,
3254.57 but then you can increase that intensity.
3256.83 So, try to decrease.
3258.23 I mean, just what we were talking about.
3260.31 Think of light intensity,
duration, color, and time of day.
3265.17 You really have to keep these
four things together, right?
3268.75 - We've roomed together
at a couple meetings
3271.24 from time to time, no longer,
3272.66 because one of us not to be
named has a severe snoring issue
3276.78 that made the other one pseudo-homicidal.
3279.259 [Samer laughing]
3281.3 You can guess who that was.
3284.59 But I've seen you check your phone
3287.46 after dark once or twice.
- Mm hm.
3290.4 - And you did it by sort
of pointing your phone
3293.17 away from you, right?
- Exactly, yep, absolutely.
3295.557 - And actually I'm sort of half joking,
3298.164 and you dim it quite a bit.
- Yeah, dim it quite a lot.
3299.5 - I'm sort of half joking,
3300.47 but it actually makes
sense that if you shine
3302.73 a flashlight in your eye,
3303.79 it's much brighter than
if you shine a flashlight-
3304.623 - Light only go in direct line,
3306.47 so if you'd just look on the side,
3308.16 most of the light is going to go this way,
3309.86 and you're only seeing this way.
3311.65 - Okay, so, and as
silly as that might seem
3313.82 to people listening, I mean what it means
3315.46 is that getting bright
light in your eyes at night
3318.77 is something that you
really want to avoid.
3321.54 But there is the reality that-
3323.01 - And even when I check
sometimes if I have something,
3326.697 and I check it so fast
and switch it off so fast.
3329.3 So I'm also aware of duration-
- Not my messages.
3332.54 - I'm also aware of the duration, right?
3334.78 So duration, intensity,
color, and time of day.
3338.24 Ideally I should not
check iPhones an iPads.
3341.18 I don't use iPad at
night because it's hard
3343.41 to lower it enough 'cause it's a huge.
3346.48 But even my iPhone, I try
not to use it at night.
3349.52 And like once it becomes 8:30 or 9:00,
3352.49 I don't look at it at all.
- Unless it's World Cup
3354.98 or Euro Cup, in which case
Samer's on 24 hours, everybody.
3357.566 - Right, that's only every four years.
3360.473 - He's a big soccer fan.
3362.23 All right, this has been
incredibly, no pun, illuminating.
3367.78 Let's talk about the
relationship between light
3370.45 and some of these other non-circadian
3373.6 or pseudo-circadian effects.
3375.89 And we will try and link those.
3379.18 But you had a what I
consider absolutely landmark
3383.38 beautiful paper published
in "Nature" a few years ago,
3386.94 showing that if you disrupt
the exposure to light
3392.79 or the timing of the exposure to light
3395.0 that there are dramatic
effects on the stress system
3398.15 and on the learning and memory system.
3401.05 Maybe we could talk about each of those
3403.08 separately or together.
3404.98 What are the effects on stress
and the effects on learning
3408.07 when light viewing behavior
3410.99 and sleep-wake cycles are disrupted?
3413.35 - Yeah, so just to remind
you, you know that,
3417.591 but to remind your
listeners that I was trained
3420.48 as a circadian biologist.
3421.74 So I really was indoctrinated
into thinking that light
3426.48 has to affect the clock,
3427.67 which then caused all
these different effects.
3430.17 So, that's what I believe.
3431.91 That's my dogma.
3432.76 That's what have made me really happy.
3434.7 And then Tara LeGates and
Cara Altimus joined the lab
3439.935 and we started discussing a lot of data.
3441.417 And we said, what if there
is a direct effect of light
3444.2 that we're missing, independent
of the circadian clock?
3447.24 So this is not an easy
question to us to answer,
3449.99 because as we've been talking all along,
3452.08 light affects the circadian clock.
3453.68 So how could you give light
at different times of the day
3457.337 and not mess up the circadian clock?
3459.3 Luckily, we came up with such a way,
3461.04 and that's why it was important
to do these experiments
3464.95 the way we did them.
3466.45 And we proved that this light-dark cycle
3468.92 does not disrupt the clock,
3469.79 there is still a circadian rhythm,
3472.46 and does not cause sleep deprivation.
3475.9 And yet, surprisingly, if you give light
3478.82 at the wrong time of the day,
3480.16 even without disrupting
the circadian clock
3482.76 or without causing sleep deprivation,
3485.01 as you mentioned you get
the huge mood changes
3488.62 in the organisms and you
get learning deficit.
3492.74 So, this really, and at
the time people have really
3497.03 hit us hard.
3497.863 I mean, it was really
hard to publish this work
3501.14 and you could, yeah.
3502.73 - Well, it came out in "Nature."
3503.99 - Yeah.
- So in the end you prevailed,
3506.87 but I want to make sure that I understand.
3508.37 So, you're saying that yes,
3510.98 there are effects of light
on the circadian rhythm.
3513.22 - Absolutely.
- Sleep meaning
3514.053 sleep and wakefulness.
- Yes.
3516.11 - And their timing.
3517.42 However, there are direct
effects of light on mood
3520.85 that can be dissociated from the effects
3522.893 on sleep and waking.
- Absolutely.
3524.85 - So if I interpret that correctly,
3527.17 that could mean that when we
view light and how much light,
3532.87 could make us feel happier or
less happy or even depressed,
3536.81 stressed, learning, et cetera.
3539.64 - Bingo.
- Even if we're sleeping
3542.01 and waking up at the appropriate time?
3543.92 - Bingo.
3544.753 I mean, eventually because we're talking
3546.74 about the whole system,
3548.06 eventually when you start
having the other problems,
3550.41 you also develop sleep problems,
3552.9 but you're absolutely right.
3554.2 And in fact, now, research
from Diego Fernandez
3557.307 in the lab have found that
now we know that they actually
3561.57 require different brain regions.
3563.13 So we don't only have a theory,
3565.2 we don't only have a light environment
3566.94 that showed they can be dissociated,
3569.24 we know that they use completely
different brain regions.
3572.32 So, the SCN that I told you about earlier,
3574.59 the place where the central pacemaker is,
3576.7 the one that receives
direct input from the retina
3579.41 through the ipRCGs to
adjust your circadian clock
3583.09 is not the area that
receives the light input
3586.04 for mood regulation.
3587.07 It's a completely different brain region.
3589.03 - What's the brain region called?
3590.19 - So the brain region,
3591.05 we called it the perihabenular nucleus.
3594.08 I'm not so sure how good or bad the name,
3595.87 but it doesn't matter, it's that PHb.
3598.02 And what's really amazing,
3599.21 this region also receives direct input
3601.29 from the ipRCGs, but projects
to areas in the brain
3604.53 that are known to regulate mood,
3606.27 including the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex,
3610.59 which has been studied for many years
3613.21 to be impacted in the human depression.
3616.01 So just by this amazing serendipity
3619.86 to find that a region that is
so deep in the advanced brain,
3625.1 like the prefrontal cortex
is your executive brain,
3629.07 one of the most elaborated in humans,
3632.06 to see that they receive inputs from
3634.24 these ancient photoreceptor
was stunning to us,
3638.26 and told us how much we didn't understand
3640.41 the importance of light
on a human behavior.
3643.12 - So, how does that finding
inform daily protocols
3647.66 for you or for other people?
3648.98 I realize you can't leap
always from one paper-
3651.103 - Absolutely, yes.
- To daily protocol.
3653.71 But if light indeed does
control prefrontal cortex,
3657.14 executive function,
learning, stress and mood,
3662.45 and let's say I'm waking up
each morning and I'm sleeping.
3665.18 What should I do different?
3666.39 - That's why we came up
with the tripartite model
3668.92 because yes, we could think
about just adjusting the clock
3672.16 with lights in and being
dark throughout the day.
3674.89 But that may not be important
3676.41 for your whole physiological function.
3677.94 So, now, if we include these
other effects of light,
3681.69 that's why I prefer to still
get a lot of light in the day.
3684.67 I don't want to be in
very dim light condition
3686.93 throughout the day.
- I see.
3688.04 - So, even though it
doesn't affect your clock,
3690.69 as you beautifully said, Andrew,
3692.13 it may affect your mood
and learning and memory.
3694.76 It may affect your alertness level,
3696.61 which is going to allow
you to learn better.
3698.55 It may affect your homeostatic drive,
3701.16 maybe your homeostatic
factor would go higher
3703.49 so you could sleep earlier.
3705.27 So it's important to think
of light as stimulating
3708.53 all these brain regions,
3709.84 which means it's producing more activity,
3712.34 which in reality this is how people think
3714.33 of the homeostatic drive,
that the more active you are,
3717.18 the more the homeostatic
drive is built up,
3719.73 the better you sleep.
3721.52 So that's why we came up
with the tripartite model
3724.6 because as a circadian biologist,
3726.55 I only thought of light
through the circadian clock
3728.82 affecting behavior.
3730.25 As a sleep biologist, they
only thought of the homeostatic
3732.86 drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior.
3735.81 And for people who study light
for vision and other form,
3738.6 they thought only of
the environmental input.
3741.01 But now if you put them all together,
3742.87 you get with this tripartite model
3744.71 where it's really mind boggling.
3746.66 And it makes so much sense.
3748.32 The organism doesn't want to
depend on a single component,
3751.63 but if you could incorporate
these three together,
3754.7 you could have a beautiful
system that is well adapted.
3758.09 So let me tell you the
sleep-wake cycle, right?
3760.35 So we know that there
is a homeostatic drive
3762.81 to affect sleep.
3763.643 You've had beautiful talks about that.
3765.89 - Which is basically
the longer you're awake,
3767.51 the more you want to be asleep.
3768.527 - So, that's your homeostatic drive.
3770.32 We've talked about the
circadian influence of sleep
3772.89 and the fact that light-dark cycle
3774.97 affect the circadian system,
which eventually affects sleep.
3778.07 So these two components
are well understood.
3780.29 Now the third factor is your direct light
3783.18 or environmental input.
3784.77 How much stress, how much
light you get from there
3787.29 also can highly impact sleep.
3789.66 So even if you have a good
circadian and homeostatic drive,
3793.32 if you're getting light at
the wrong time of the day,
3795.8 or if you're being stressed
and thinking a lot,
3798.09 then your sleep is going to suffer.
3799.83 So you have to think of the three together
3802.66 to have a beautiful sleep-wake cycle.
3805.07 - I see.
- And that's why
3806.41 we came up with the tripartite model.
3808.12 The same thing happens with feeding.
3809.7 I could beautifully put it to people.
3811.75 Your hunger, your energy level is measured
3814.29 by the arcuate nucleus.
3816.15 Your daily intake of food is again,
3818.3 dependent on the SCN and light-dark input.
3821.12 We found that if food is not available,
3823.97 there is yet a third input that
is not depending on the SCN,
3828.53 not depend on the arcuate,
3829.82 depending on a completely
different brain regions.
3832.86 So the animal can actually start looking
3835.02 or the human can start looking
for food when it's scarce,
3838.56 even at time when they are
not supposed to be active.
3841.56 So, that's how the organism think,
3843.21 they have to evaluate multiple
inputs for them to decide
3847.4 what is the best physiological outcome
3849.27 at that moment, at that season?
3851.35 - I see.
3852.98 So, I want to get into
arcuate and feeding,
3854.73 but just to make sure
we can keep our hands
3857.42 around this tripartite model.
3859.55 So, if I understand correctly,
3860.68 we've got the circadian influence,
3863.04 then you've also got the drive to sleep.
3865.37 - Right.
- Actually, one of the ways
3867.11 that I think that can be best
understood is if somebody
3870.29 ever pulls an all-nighter,
3872.1 they get tired around
11:00 or 12:00 or so,
3875.4 and then very tired
around 3:00, 4:00 a.m.,
3878.53 but then even if you stay
up sometime right around
3881.113 7:00 or 8:00 a.m., your
normal wake up time,
3882.87 you start to feel alert again.
3884.21 - Exactly.
- And that's because
3885.52 the sleep drive is extremely strong,
3888.0 but there's a circadian rhythm that drives
3889.84 wakefulness in the morning.
- Exactly.
3891.08 - Okay, so that's two are the components.
3892.78 - [Samer] Right.
3893.76 - Before we get into
the feeding component,
3895.33 I want to talk about these direct effects
3896.57 of light on mood.
- Mm hm.
3898.06 - Okay, Diego Fernandez's data.
3901.13 And this perihabenular thing.
- Sure.
3903.6 - So, let's just for the
moment set aside the tri part
3907.63 of the tripartite model and just focus on
3909.65 what are the direct
effects of light on mood?
3912.06 And the way that I interpret
what you've said so far
3914.4 is that the protocol
that emerges from this
3916.63 if one trying to optimize their mood is,
3919.47 yes, see light, view light I
should say, early in the day,
3922.83 in order to set your circadian clock.
3924.61 Maybe also in the evening as well.
3926.58 And of course, avoid light at night,
3928.71 get it as dim as possible.
3930.51 However, you said, it's
also a good idea to get
3935.81 as much bright light during
the day as you safely can,
3938.92 in order to improve
your mood independently
3941.52 of regulating your sleep-wake cycle.
3943.047 - And that's the hypothesis.
3944.41 Here's the problem where
it's not going to be
3946.17 as satisfying as the
circadian is that as you know,
3949.22 this brain region has been
discovered very recently.
3952.11 - Habenula?
- The perihabenular region.
3954.02 - Well, we've known about it a long time,
3955.39 but nobody knew what it did.
3956.32 - So, we knew about the habenula,
3957.637 but that's why the name is confusing.
3959.76 It's actually not the habenula itself.
3961.777 It's the perihabenular.
- Oh, near the habenula.
3963.46 - It's near the habenula.
3964.32 - Why don't you just call
it the Samer Hattar nucleus?
3966.23 - I should have.
3967.063 I don't know why I haven't done that.
3968.55 - Maybe 'cause if you
do that, it's not okay.
3970.51 Okay, so for here ever after
the perihabenular nucleus,
3974.51 we should probably call it the Hattar-
3976.223 - The Hattar-Fernandez.
3977.056 - How about
Hattar-Fernandez-Berson nucleus.
3978.8 - Yeah, that should-
- Okay, this is like nerdy
3980.84 science attribution stuff,
but I'm just going to call it
3983.24 the Hattar nucleus.
3984.74 Wikipedia, line it up.
3987.166 Okay, so this structure is taking light,
3989.38 and independent of sleep
rhythms and circadian rhythms,
3992.35 it's driving changes in mood.
- Something.
3994.18 - How does it do that?
3995.06 Is this through the dopamine system?
3995.893 The serotonin system?
- We still recently,
3998.98 we haven't identified
this region very well.
4001.164 We don't know what light does to it.
4002.76 We don't know how it interacts.
4004.74 So this is an area that
is ripe for discoveries
4007.66 and we're working on this right now.
4009.68 But that's why I said,
it's not satisfying.
4011.81 This is like the function of sleep.
4014.06 Why do we sleep?
4015.23 We know sleep is very important to us,
4017.09 but we still don't have
a satisfying function
4019.41 of why do we sleep, right?
4020.97 - I see but the why questions-
- We have hypothesis.
4022.754 - The why questions, I
think it's our good friend
4025.19 and colleague at University of Washington,
4026.62 Russ Van Gelder, who always says,
4028.17 when somebody asks why, that
the best answer is just to say,
4031.17 I wasn't consulted at the design phase.
4032.95 - Yeah, exactly.
- Right, none of us
4034.31 really know why.
- No, but the point is
4036.52 maybe I shouldn't have said why,
4037.68 what is the function of sleep?
4039.19 It's still very hard to know.
4042.73 What is the reason organisms
have to go offline for so long?
4048.13 You know, people assume it's for repair,
4049.88 assume it's for learning and memory,
4051.367 assume all kind of stuff,
4052.73 but there is really no
clear function for sleeping.
4057.25 There is no clear function for sleeping.
4060.059 I mean, if you talk to
people, there are hypotheses.
4062.36 - I mean, all we know is
that if you don't sleep-
4064.491 - Exactly.
- Or your sleep
4065.324 is very fractured, you get messed up.
4066.777 - And you could die even, right?
4068.49 I mean, it's really
bad if you don't sleep,
4071.76 but we don't know what is the function?
4075.64 What is that sleep have done to organisms
4078.29 that couldn't have done with rest?
4080.81 What if you just could
rest without sleeping?
4083.05 Just sit down and rest.
4084.2 - Well, my lab is trying to
figure out whether or not
4086.24 these non-sleep deep rest protocols
4088.06 can compensate for sleep.
4090.103 - That would be interesting.
- I mean, obviously sleep
4091.16 is better, but many people are not getting
4093.69 the sleep that they need.
4094.63 - Right.
- But, okay.
4096.493 So, and if people are
sensing that Samer and I
4099.04 are about to start talking
over each other and arguing,
4101.06 that's always the goal
4102.15 when we talk, right?
- That's right.
4103.53 - Unlike other scientists I interact with,
4105.54 when Samer and I get together,
4106.72 it's considered a successful conversation
4108.93 if we get into a big fight,
4110.24 and then go for a big meal-
- That's right.
4111.74 - Where I pick the restaurant.
[Samer chuckling]
4113.28 Okay, so let's talk about
food and eating and appetite.
4119.13 You had yet another, yes, I
greatly admire your success
4124.754 in this way, yet another
incredible discovery
4128.21 showing that there are
direct effects of light
4132.89 on appetite and feeding behavior.
4135.28 Okay, maybe you could just summarize
4136.46 those results for people.
4138.57 - Honestly, that paper is
the one that allowed us
4140.65 to come with the tripartite model,
4142.17 because we were thinking
completely wrong about it.
4144.9 We wanted, this experiment,
it'd be fun for your audience
4148.7 to hear why we started this experiment.
4150.93 Remember that when we
discovered the ipRCGs,
4154.07 we figured if they are the only relay
4157.376 to entrain the circadian clock,
4159.3 then you could kill them
and have an animal opposite
4162.77 to the one that we spoke or
a human opposite to the one
4165.3 that we spoke about earlier.
4166.43 Where instead of having no pattern vision
4169.41 and have circadian photoentrainment,
4171.57 we could produce an animal
that have pattern vision,
4174.0 but no circadian photoentrainment.
4175.761 - Hm, so circadian blind.
4177.58 - Circadian blind, but pattern sighted.
4180.8 And we succeeded in that.
4182.88 The problem when you have these animals,
4184.54 which I've told you many times already
4186.88 is that they don't adjust
to the day-night cycle.
4189.71 So doing experiments on them
become very complicated.
4193.33 - What is their behavior like
if you don't have these cells?
4195.83 Are they awake and then
asleep, awake and then asleep?
4197.18 - They just drift like the
humans we've talked about.
4199.83 - They think they're in Las Vegas
4201.351 with no clocks or watch-
- They drift, exactly.
4203.01 - They stay up later every
night and go to sleep-
4204.45 - They can either, depend on their clock.
4206.39 If their clock is shorter,
they come in earlier.
4208.61 If their clock is longer,
they come in later.
4210.13 - So they're really messed up?
4211.17 - They really don't adjust to it.
4212.96 If they were in the wild,
4214.12 they'll be eliminated in a second, right?
4216.01 There is no way they'll survive.
4218.02 So, me and Diego started
talking and we're like,
4220.9 what if we use non-light
in training agent?
4223.65 And what is the strongest
non-light in training agent?
4226.86 Food.
4228.02 So we thought that the
light defective animals
4232.65 will have more sensitivity
to food entrainment
4234.87 because as you know more than me,
4236.44 this is an area that you've
worked really well on,
4238.88 for vision, if you're image blind,
4241.02 your hearing and somatosensory
get improved, right?
4244.88 The lack of vision improves
your hearing and sensation.
4249.61 But we found actually
that if you don't have
4252.11 the light to system, actually
the food ability to entrain
4257.49 the animal goes completely to the ground.
4259.83 Completely opposite to what we predicted.
4262.74 - So light viewing and feeding
behavior are interacting
4267.28 in ways that support one another.
4268.667 - And that's why we came
with the tripartite model.
4270.99 We figured it's different than
sensation of the environment.
4274.28 When you sense with vision,
vision and hearing interact,
4277.65 but your vision is a real full modality.
4280.14 You want to see.
4281.4 That's what vision wants to do.
4283.15 You want to hear.
4284.12 That's what hearing wants to do.
4285.61 You want to sense.
4286.48 That's what sensing want to do.
4288.27 But for the circadian system, light, food,
4292.34 all these entraining agent,
4293.81 they somehow have to interact
to keep a coherent system.
4298.29 You don't just assume if you remove light,
4300.18 this one is going to be stronger.
4301.42 No, they need to know each others.
4303.7 The light informs when the
animal is going to eat.
4306.39 - Well, what I like about
this so much is that
4310.48 in the world outside of science,
4312.64 in which I don't really exist
in, but that I see a lot of,
4316.55 this kind of wellness and stuff with
4318.71 all this mind-body integration stuff.
4321.97 It's interesting because
people view the body
4325.1 more as a system, right?
4326.61 A system of organs that interact,
4328.42 as opposed to the way
that standard science
4331.337 and medical profession is like,
4333.17 you work on the liver or
you're ear, nose and throat,
4335.77 or heart and lung, or brain or-
4338.15 - Wow, that's a great
way of thinking about it.
4340.1 - But the biology is integrated.
4342.1 - Yeah.
- And so, for somebody who's
4346.0 interested in effecting
their eating behavior,
4349.36 something that you are familiar with,
4351.66 and that we will talk more about
4353.01 your experiences of in a moment,
4356.38 how should they use
light in order to adjust
4359.33 their eating behavior?
- Right.
4361.45 So, now that I've told you
about all these interaction
4364.21 between the different inputs
to the circadian clock,
4367.81 just you think about it as an engineer,
4369.78 what would be the best thing?
4371.33 The best thing is to know
when your food times happen
4375.27 in the day, when should you get light,
4377.37 and when is your circadian
clock in your system, right?
4382.06 So, if you eat at very
specific times of the day,
4385.52 that's another signal that is
telling your body, your clock,
4388.69 you're in a certain time of the day.
4390.61 So if you're having lunch at
the correct time every day,
4393.33 and you're getting bright light,
4394.64 now you have two systems that
are informing your clock,
4398.08 your clock is going to be better.
4399.56 - So regular mealtimes?
4401.03 - Regular mealtimes that
fit your circadian clock.
4404.19 So, and in fact, if you do
that, when I started doing this,
4408.38 and it helped me lose weight,
4410.11 is that I'm exposing
myself to the right amount
4413.02 of light-dark cycle, I'm
eating at regular time.
4415.92 It is amazing.
4417.03 You would be not hungry,
let's say you eat at noon,
4419.62 you will not feel any hunger at 11:45.
4422.693 And then all of a sudden the hunger jumps.
4425.21 This is clearly not an energy issue
4427.08 because it could not be that drastic.
4429.49 - No, the desire to eat is
mainly driven by these cues,
4434.17 these hormone cues that are
very exquisitely timed to-
4439.46 - Exactly.
- Sleep-wake cycle,
4440.86 but also to light.
- Exactly.
4442.8 And you know, in the wild,
4444.54 you could imagine why energy level
4446.43 through the arcuate nucleus-
4448.077 - You should explain to
people what the arcuate is
4450.13 'cause I don't think we've
done that adequately.
4451.95 The arcuate nucleus is an
area of the hypothalamus
4454.31 that drives hunger and feeding behavior.
4456.7 And what we're talking
about is the fact that
4459.22 it's taking cues from
your viewing of light,
4463.12 believe it or not, is
impacting your level of hunger.
4466.27 And this is a non-trivial way
in which your timing of hunger
4471.91 and amount of hunger is regulated by when
4474.52 and how much light you view.
4476.79 So, let me ask you a couple of practical-
4478.82 - But can I just, this is
really, before you asked me-
4480.771 - Sure.
- Sorry, Andrew.
4482.34 We said we are going to fight, but to me,
4485.2 the interesting thing to think about it,
4486.97 in the wild when you didn't
have the availability
4488.96 of food that we have,
the arcuate plays a huge
4492.35 important role because
if you weren't successful
4495.82 in getting food, then the
arcuate is going to tell you,
4498.61 look, you have to take
risks and go get food
4501.16 because your energy level is very low.
4503.24 And that's great, there's tons
of great research about that.
4506.43 But I think what's missing
is the fact in humans,
4509.36 we're not getting to a situation...
4511.47 Most of us, we're not
getting to a situation
4514.07 where we have low energy levels.
4516.42 Most of the time actually
we eat not because
4518.557 we are really have low energy,
4521.44 but because we want to eat.
4523.01 So I think that's why
I feel that the timing
4526.36 is very important for us because we always
4528.99 have enough energy level for us to eat.
4531.54 - Well, I mean, I enjoy
eating so much that I'll eat
4533.88 just for the sensation of chewing.
4535.44 - True, true.
- I mean,
4536.273 I enjoy the taste too.
- True, absolutely.
4538.31 - And I enjoy the social aspects
4539.82 when those are a part of it.
- Absolutely.
4540.97 - But I literally enjoyed
the physical act of chewing.
4543.83 - [Samer] Absolutely, absolutely.
4545.73 Uh huh.
- Which explains a lot.
4549.3 Okay, so how regular are
you or do you recommend
4554.48 people be about mealtimes?
4556.27 Because what I'm hearing is
that light viewing behavior
4561.06 is pretty straightforward.
4561.98 Get a lot of light in the
morning and throughout the day,
4563.92 minimize it in the evening and
at night, generally speaking,
4567.43 for sake of mood and circadian rhythm.
4569.15 But for sake of regulating
timing and quality
4573.594 I should also say of food intake,
4575.8 because people clearly make
better choices about food intake
4578.42 when they are anticipating a meal
4580.74 and they aren't constantly hungry.
4582.7 And so, the ability to regulate
hunger for particular phases
4586.13 of the circadian cycle is
quite valuable for all people.
4589.16 Not just people trying to
lose weight, but all people.
4592.35 Are we talking about down to the minute?
4594.85 - Absolutely not.
4595.683 - All right, so 12:00
noon is my normal lunch,
4598.71 let's say plus or minus?
4601.42 - Half an hour.
- Okay.
4602.93 So eat around between 11:30 and 12:30.
4606.1 - If that's the time.
4607.287 And it depends if you
also do multiple meals.
4609.64 Remember three meals, that's
a decision that somebody
4612.89 came up with, I don't know why.
4614.36 - And nowadays, fewer people
are doing that I think.
4616.44 - Yeah.
- Given our friend,
4617.953 Satchin Panda's work.
- Right.
4619.45 I mean, so you could have two meals,
4621.27 you could have very multiple
meals that are distributed
4626.16 across your active time.
4627.97 I agree with Satchin Panda's
work that try to avoid eating
4632.53 when your system is
supposed to be relaxing,
4634.89 when you're supposed to
be at non-active times.
4638.64 So, limit your eating to the
active time of your cycle.
4643.63 And that seemed to be, and Joe Takashi
4645.91 is doing some beautiful stuff on this,
4648.21 that seems to be incredibly important
4650.14 for aspect of the circadian.
4653.34 - And for health.
- And for health.
4654.69 - Yeah, we're referring
to Satchin Panda's work,
4657.55 he wrote a beautiful book
called "The Circadian Code."
4659.87 Maybe Samer, with some luck
you'll write a book as well.
4663.48 Meaning the world will be
lucky to have that book,
4666.11 but Satchin's data really
strongly point to the fact
4669.61 that liver health, brain
health, metabolic factors,
4675.33 and endocrine factors of
various systems and organs
4678.62 all seem to benefit from having
a period of each 24 hour day
4682.27 in which we are not eating anything
4683.66 and then eating at very regular mealtimes.
4684.858 - [Samer] Absolutely.
4686.84 - Let's talk about eating and mealtimes
4688.6 and let's move a little bit away
4690.34 from the science for the moment,
4692.18 although we will return to it,
4693.52 and talk a little bit
more about your experience
4696.71 with eating and mealtimes.
4698.52 So, you're looking in good shape lately.
4701.47 - Thank you.
- I know you've been
4702.41 putting work into it.
- Yeah.
4703.77 - We talk a lot and you've been exercising
4705.95 and you've been eating
well, meaning quality food.
4710.53 You just came back from Jordan
4711.58 where I'm assuming the food is amazing.
4713.253 - Yes, the food is amazing and honestly,
4715.49 usually I gain a lot of weight in Jordan,
4717.79 but this time I didn't gain any weight,
4720.04 which was really nice, so.
4721.38 - Yeah, when I met you, you
were probably about 100 pounds
4728.74 heavier than you are now.
4729.86 - Yeah, 275 pounds.
4731.357 I'm 219 now.
4733.01 It's crazy, yeah.
- You had a lot of vigor then,
4734.981 and you have a lot of vigor now,
4736.72 but I know that you undertook
a very specific protocol
4741.55 in order to lose the weight,
4743.77 based on your understanding
of the circadian system-
4745.55 - Yes!
- And of light,
4746.98 and appetite and mood.
4749.19 Maybe you could just tell
us a little bit about
4750.95 what that schedule looks like.
4752.31 And we realize that this
is not a prescriptive
4754.38 for everybody, but you
found what worked for you.
4756.73 - Yeah.
- To maybe just describe
4758.37 those changes.
- I mean, honestly,
4759.46 I followed my circadian cycle, right?
4761.58 Of what we've talked about, right?
4764.02 So I dimmed the light at night,
I slept at regular hours,
4767.97 I ate my major food in breakfast and lunch
4771.05 when I'm really active
and I'm really hungry.
4773.66 And at night when I avoid dinner,
4775.76 because my circadian system
really shuts off at 3:00.
4778.4 I'm an early person.
4779.9 Like you could give me anything
I would eat before 3:00,
4782.43 after 3:00, nothing appeals to me anymore.
4784.78 My system is shut off.
4786.14 - Well, what time are you going to sleep?
4787.27 And what time are you waking up?
4788.103 - Oh, so in my case, I
should have put this up.
4790.34 I mean, I go to sleep
literally at 9:00 p.m..
4793.4 I mean, I literally five
minutes after 9:00 p.m.,
4796.61 I'm completely out.
4798.4 And I wake up between 4:30 and 5:00 a.m..
4801.04 So if I extend it, I go to 6:00 a.m.,
4803.63 but very rarely.
4804.69 It depends on how tired I was.
4806.65 - And that, as I recall, was
an important set of changes
4810.63 for you to be able to-
- Absolutely.
4811.69 - Regulate your food intake.
4812.543 - Absolutely because then I'm
having very big breakfast,
4816.41 and again for different
people it's different,
4819.46 I have a big breakfast
at 7:00 a.m. maximum.
4822.88 So I have a big breakfast,
coffee, and all this stuff.
4825.89 Then I have some simple
snack around 10:00.
4829.05 Then I have regularly lunch at noon,
4831.06 or between noon to 1:00.
4832.25 Then I have another snack at 3:00.
4834.297 And the hardest time to regulate the food
4836.24 is between 12:00 and 3:00.
4837.073 This is when I really
feel hungry all the time.
4839.323 - This is your equivalent of kind of
4840.87 late evening for most people.
4841.92 - Yes!
- So for me,
4842.759 it would probably be
between 7:00 and 10:00 p.m..
4844.62 - Exactly, exactly.
- Got it.
4846.4 - And then at night I'm
completely not hungry,
4849.02 but usually as you said,
4850.4 the beauty or the enjoyment of food,
4852.66 like when my wife cooks some
really beautiful Indian food,
4856.13 I eat, but I'm not hungry.
4858.19 And I notice if I eat with
that, I usually gain weight.
4861.16 But if I regulate that at
night, I also lose weight.
4864.44 So there is a combination of
all these things that help you
4868.22 adjust the input of
food, the input of light,
4872.37 the input of the clock,
and the drive to hunger.
4875.92 - Yeah, I appreciate you sharing that.
4877.49 And I want to emphasize that some people
4879.52 are not hungry early in the day.
4881.17 They might be late shifted people.
4882.761 - Exactly.
- In which case,
4883.594 eating later in the day
will work well for them.
4885.024 - It will work well as
long as they don't eat
4886.63 early in the morning.
4887.463 That's just, you have to
work with your schedule,
4889.9 with your active schedule.
4891.46 - Yeah, you and I have been talking
4892.293 about this offline for years.
4893.78 I'm glad we're finally having
this discussion publicly now.
4896.71 What we're talking about really is finding
4898.27 your ideal sleep schedule.
4899.77 - Exactly, exactly.
- And finding your ideal
4902.38 eating schedule.
- Exactly.
4903.79 - And understanding how
those two things interact.
4906.532 - And do you know the
nice thing, as you said,
4908.07 finding them out is going to help you
4909.74 to understand how they interact
4911.43 because we know from the tripartite model
4913.03 that they are all interconnected.
4915.86 And for each person they're going to be
4917.59 interconnected differently.
4919.63 So, for each person you would...
4922.01 You know, for me, if I exercise at night,
4925.37 I'm going to mess up my whole system.
4926.953 - When do you exercise?
- Morning.
4928.96 Morning works great for me.
4930.48 I mean, it's amazing.
4931.84 Morning exercise for me works great.
4934.57 If I tried one time,
because it was easier for me
4937.28 to exercise at night before I leave,
4939.27 when the traffic is there from the night.
4941.117 And I think that messed me up
because I couldn't sleep well
4944.7 and I couldn't wake up well.
4946.06 And that led to more changes in my food.
4947.89 I gained weight again
actually, believe it or not,
4950.91 even though I was exercising.
4952.64 So I think this really makes
me think that you have to think
4956.93 of the tripartite model to
see what is the best times
4961.37 and what is the best interrelation between
4963.59 the different component,
as you beautifully said,
4965.94 between your mealtimes,
your light exposure,
4968.38 and your sleep that works for you.
4970.81 - Well, thanks for that.
4971.643 Usually Samer's insulting me.
4973.13 Today, he's complimenting me.
4974.61 I'm going to compliment
him right back by saying,
4977.12 this is the first time that
I've ever really understood
4981.5 how yes, light can control sleep.
4984.49 Yes, it control mood.
4987.1 Yes, it can impact feeding,
4989.1 but that it's really about
doing the self exploration
4991.75 to align those in the way that works best.
4994.62 And what I'm hearing,
tell me if I'm wrong,
4996.56 but what I'm hearing is
that once you understand
4999.37 what gives you the best sleep-wake cycle,
5001.98 then you should exercise
during the period of time
5005.53 in which you feel most alert.
5007.68 And if it works for your schedule,
5010.73 ideally you would also eat
during the time in which
5013.19 you feel most alert and then stop eating
5015.767 and stop light viewing behavior
as you head towards sleep.
5018.27 - Right.
5019.103 So, the only thing I would say
that complicates all of this,
5022.3 and that's what makes me
sad, is your light exposure.
5025.12 - Mine personally?
- Sorry.
5026.18 - No, I'm just kidding.
5027.95 - The people's light exposure, right?
5029.9 This is what complicates it
because you're not going to be able
5033.63 to figure all this out if
you're shifting yourself
5036.49 out of your comfort zone.
5037.74 - By viewing-
- By viewing light
5039.51 at the wrong time of the day.
5041.24 So, let's say if you were under
an ideal natural conditions,
5047.01 you're a person who would
sleep later than me.
5049.26 Let's say we'll sleep at midnight
and wake up at 8:00 a.m..
5052.97 Let's say you don't
eat anything till noon,
5055.01 and as you said, you
eat late in the evening.
5057.86 Then this would be perfect for you,
5059.61 but now see what happens
if now you include
5062.47 the light component.
5063.32 Now, if you push your sleep
from midnight to 4:00 a.m.,
5066.81 now you're waking up in the
morning and you're actually
5070.7 really not the morning...
5071.89 You're working, I'm sorry, at
noon instead of eight o'clock,
5075.05 and the time where you're
not supposed to be hungry,
5077.47 now you're going to start
eating directly at noon
5079.74 or something like that, or even delay it.
5081.72 And now you're shifting your whole cycle.
5083.99 And you don't know if this
interaction between your sleep,
5086.5 feeding and the light-dark environment
5088.29 are still going to be maintained or not.
5090.6 And that's the problem that people have.
5092.51 - So, as I'm hearing this what
I'm realizing is most of us,
5096.69 probably me included, are
messing up at least one, two,
5100.83 or three of these components.
- Exactly, exactly.
5102.46 - But that the probe, the way
to figure out what's right
5106.98 for oneself is to start
manipulating light exposure.
5110.33 - Right and I'm going to be honest,
5112.61 I'm biased 'cause I believe that light
5115.16 is the strongest time giver.
5117.97 And a lot of people disagree.
5119.61 Some people think feeding is.
5121.09 - I always thought that light
was the primary zeitgeber,
5123.41 the primary light-
- Yeah, but a lot of people
5125.02 think it's food.
5125.853 A lot of people even sometimes
mentioned social interaction.
5128.67 - Have they read the literature?
5130.01 - I agree with you.
5131.127 I totally agree with you.
5132.47 - I mean, my understanding is that light
5133.85 is the most powerful driver-
- Absolutely.
5135.537 - Of the things we're talking about.
5136.48 - That's why I think we
need to regulate this first
5138.7 and everything else fits.
5140.47 And you know, the nice thing
is that your sleep-wake cycle
5143.4 and exercise tell you really bluntly
5145.87 if you're doing it right or not.
5147.273 - Tell me more about that.
- I'll tell you more.
5148.81 When I shifted my exercise, honestly,
5152.17 things fell apart like never before.
5154.32 - When you moved from
exercising early in the day
5156.743 to late in the day?
- In the morn, yeah.
5157.576 It completely fell apart for me.
5159.52 I didn't enjoy exercise at night.
5161.52 My pain tolerance for
exercise wasn't as good.
5164.32 I'm talking with N equals
one and I'm aware of this.
5166.53 I've never tested this
empirically, but at least to me,
5170.5 it really messed up everything.
5172.39 I started having problem
because my body temperature
5174.55 would go up and that will affect my sleep.
5177.01 I possibly was running in
the gym with a lot of lights.
5179.5 So maybe the light was
a component, but for me,
5183.1 exercising in the morning,
it's so much better for me.
5186.417 But a lot of people can't even
5187.95 think of exercising in the morning.
5189.79 So it depends on when you feel comfortable
5192.0 in your sleep-wake
cycle and your exercise.
5194.22 I think that tells you if your system
5195.91 is in synchrony with one another.
5198.51 - That's really interesting.
5200.15 We're good friends, our
friend, Pat Dossett,
5202.563 that we both know.
- Mm hm, oh, absolutely.
5203.89 - He did nine years in the Seal Teams.
5205.76 And he's one of these people he says,
5207.63 he's happy to go for a
run or a swim anytime
5210.03 between 4:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m..
5212.6 And he'll train in the afternoon too
5214.21 'cause he's a Seal Team guy and
they'll do whatever anytime,
5217.42 that's part of the phenotype,
5218.86 but he feels best doing that, right?
5222.35 I like to exercise mid-morning.
5224.104 - Interesting.
- And I'm happy to skip eating
5225.88 until 12 or 1:00.
- Great.
5228.282 - And I like to go to
sleep around 11:30, 12:00,
5230.265 'cause I'm a normal human
being rather than you
5232.1 who goes to bed at 9:00 p.m.
- What about Pat actually?
5234.13 I've never asked him what time.
5235.32 - Pat?
5236.153 So, Pat's ideal to sleep
time, I've asked him this,
5238.71 would be around 8:30 or 9:00 except now-
5241.155 - Oh, so I'm like Pat!
- Yes, but he has two
5244.65 young children, two
years old and a newborn.
5247.65 And so, the cycle is disrupted, right?
5249.287 - Yeah, but that's known, right?
5251.6 I mean the effect of childbearing.
5253.46 - Right.
- And I think that we could
5254.88 talk about this, that's more complicated-
5256.974 - Right.
- But that's pretty much.
5259.13 - Yeah, I mean, I think we
need to come up with a new name
5261.57 for chronotype because-
- I agree, I agree.
5263.66 - Chronotype implies that it's
just about sleep and wake;
5267.06 being an early bird or a night owl.
5268.88 And what we're also talking
about is how exercise
5271.25 and eating match onto those.
5272.887 - The the phase relation between them.
5276.04 - Right.
- And the phases between
5277.63 different components, as you said.
5279.44 - 'Cause they interact.
- Because they interact.
5281.18 - Right.
- And they don't have
5282.55 to be in the same phase.
5283.53 Like let's say my light and food
5285.57 could be very close to each other.
5287.01 Your light and food could
be different, right?
5289.35 The phases don't have to
be, they can be plastic.
5291.87 So you have to find this for yourself.
5294.258 You maybe you're a person
who eats late at night,
5297.05 exercises late at night,
5298.95 or you may be a person who
exercise early, eat later.
5301.51 So, as long as the phase is good,
5305.22 that's what you have to find out.
5307.36 - Okay and if I understand correctly,
5308.9 when you're talking
about phase relationship,
5310.35 it means you want to lump
exercise, feeding and light for-
5314.14 - And sleep.
- And sleep in a way
5316.4 that as a coherent and total system
5319.61 makes you feel really good.
5321.17 - Temporally in a great order.
5323.27 - Uh uh.
- Absolutely.
5325.29 - And I think that-
- And I could tell you to me
5327.54 is literally getting exposed
to sun clearly in the morning,
5332.48 clearly at noon, I go out,
5333.98 I keep my windows in the
office completely open,
5337.43 eating mostly in the early
time of the day and exercising.
5340.56 And literally at the end part of the day,
5343.41 I'm not really in a more
thoughtful vegetative state.
5347.63 Like I really can't like after
5:00, I tell my students,
5351.23 if you want to tell me
anything complicated,
5353.12 you're wasting your time.
5354.36 My brain just doesn't function.
5356.35 So even though I only sleep at night,
5357.91 but I'm really starting
to shut off, ramp down.
5361.14 Really I mean, I could send email,
5364.43 talk about brainless stuff, but my power,
5367.65 my energy to do powerful stuff
really drop tremendously.
5372.29 So all my students who know me very well,
5374.34 they put the meetings with
me early in the morning
5376.98 'cause they know this is when I'm...
5378.63 So, everything for me and
for me, it's very tight.
5381.64 So it could be different for...
5383.09 It's very clustered in the morning.
5384.373 It's all tied together.
5386.0 And literally the remaining part
5387.37 seems to be just a vegetative state.
5390.431 - Mm hm.
5391.44 Yeah, you and my bulldog, Costello,
5394.7 who unfortunately passed away recently.
5396.35 - Oh no.
- Yeah.
5397.477 - I did not, that's so sad.
- Yeah, Samer and Costello
5399.01 were good friends.
5399.843 Yeah, sorry to break it to you here.
5401.57 Yeah, he had a good long
life and he went easy,
5404.46 but he had a circadian clock
that basically would just sleep
5407.3 around 24 hours a day,
5409.77 minimal activity interspersed
every third day or so.
5413.84 You do have this morning vigor.
5415.81 - Yes.
- And I think other people
5418.46 are going to have more
of an afternoon vigor.
5419.89 Do you think that this can
change across the lifespan?
5423.856 The rumor is that teenagers
naturally want to sleep in later
5428.19 and stay up later.
5429.44 Do you think that's social rhythm?
5430.84 Or do you think that
that's actually biological?
5432.5 - Yeah, that's a tough question.
5433.89 I mean, it could be both.
5437.43 One thing that worries me is
that it seems that if anything,
5441.34 with age this morning rigor gets stronger.
5444.912 - You mean, you want people to become more
5446.18 of morning people.
- More of morning people.
5447.013 - Well, why does that worry you?
5447.846 I think that's good.
5449.0 - Because for me, I'm
already very shifted morning.
5451.76 I don't want to be one of these 7:00 p.m.
5453.74 to 1:00 a.m. sleepers at some point.
5456.0 - On the other hand,
it's also kind of nice
5457.64 because it's quiet and
you can get work done.
5459.12 - Yeah, but honestly from 4:30 till 7:30
5462.35 when my wife wake up, it can be very long.
5465.77 Yes, you achieved a lot,
but it's quiet outside.
5469.991 So, I don't want to be at 1:00
a.m., let's put it this way.
5472.95 - You can tell Samer is
more social than I am.
5475.606 - That's right, that is true.
5477.057 - But we should touch on that actually.
5478.57 So, your wife, she follows
a different schedule.
5482.08 - Yeah.
- So, the social rhythm-
5484.85 - I'm honestly...
- Is important I think.
5486.89 What should we do?
5487.86 How should we conceptualize
and how should we adjust
5491.32 ourselves according to the social rhythm?
5492.153 - And I honestly love this hypothesis
5495.36 that people came up with and
Pat's kids reminded me of.
5499.32 Because kids are really going to
disrupt your sleep-wake cycle,
5502.87 it seems like there is
a chrono attraction.
5506.64 That's usually people
who attract each others
5508.98 have actually different
sleep-wake schedule.
5511.85 And the idea being is
that this allows them
5514.19 to take care of their kids
throughout the day-night cycle.
5517.19 - And have a peaceful marriage.
5518.75 - And have a peaceful
marriage in a way, right?
5521.24 So, I mean, we didn't
have kids, me and Rejji.
5523.39 So maybe this is, but it
seems like evolutionary
5526.55 it makes sense that if you
want to protect your kids,
5529.98 you don't want everybody
to be morning vigor,
5532.08 and then the kids don't have.
5533.68 So you want it distributed across.
5534.72 I mean, it makes sense.
- It's a reasonable argument.
5537.86 - Yeah.
- I've heard that one
5539.18 of the reasons that people
think that the clock
5542.37 is not exactly 24 hours,
5544.68 but it's 24 hours plus or
minus 20 minutes or so,
5548.45 is because we believe that we
evolved in clans or groups,
5553.8 villages, whatever, that
were about 100 to 200 people.
5557.09 And in order to have protection around
5560.27 the early morning hours-
- Interesting, same idea.
5561.81 - When we're vulnerable to predation
5563.93 and in the late night hours,
5565.49 that you would want some
individuals of our species
5568.17 to be naturally more like night owls
5570.07 and some more like early people.
5571.3 So your theory of parenting
is similar in that way.
5575.96 - Right.
- The social rhythm
5577.62 is a powerful rhythm though.
5579.2 Meaning if I go out and I'm tired,
5582.49 let's say I'm tired at like 9:30.
5584.01 I don't want to go out, like I'm to need-
5585.203 - So can I just say something about that?
5586.643 I think the social rhythm is
powerful at the obvious levels.
5591.41 Like it affects your sleep,
5593.27 it affects how much you wake up or eat,
5595.9 but I'm not so sure it's
as powerful as people think
5598.61 on the clock.
5599.79 Now, eventually it will mess up the clock
5601.81 because now if you're doing
a lot of social at night,
5604.76 getting enough light, eating
at the wrong time of the day,
5607.03 eventually you're going to have an effect,
5609.8 but I don't think just the
social interactions themselves
5613.88 have been shown to affect
your clock very strongly
5616.32 for some reason.
- Yeah, that's good to know.
5618.63 Well, for people hearing this,
5620.6 they're probably getting the impression
5622.25 like I'm the night owl,
and then Samer is the one
5625.37 that's in bed at 9:00 and
then wakes up at 4:00.
5628.91 But having attended many
meetings with Samer,
5631.34 I can tell you that he's the party animal.
5633.53 So let's talk about that.
5636.01 I mean, let's talk about the
fact that you're the partier,
5638.7 who's up until 2:00 dancing
at these various meetings,
5641.86 which I've seen.
- Yep.
5642.923 - He's actually a good dancer I'm told,
5645.65 but what should we do when
we do stay up very late,
5650.93 for whatever reason;
could be because we had
5652.96 to take a midnight trip to the hospital,
5654.69 an unfortunate reason,
5655.67 or it could be because you're
in the presence of people
5658.4 that you don't see very
often and you go out
5661.35 for a really nice night out on
the town and you get to sleep
5664.41 around 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning.
5667.22 How should one get back on schedule?
5669.16 Do you force yourself to
then get up and view light
5671.36 at the normal time that you
would get up and view light?
5673.47 Or do you allow yourself to sleep in?
5675.05 What what's the optimal protocol?
5676.003 - I would allow myself to sleep in,
5677.81 and remember this is a long-term effect.
5680.02 This is something that you
live with for a long period.
5682.794 And remember I told you
about the experiments
5685.21 we did with the mood,
5686.31 these required two weeks
of that light schedule
5688.95 to cause mood disturbances.
5690.57 So these don't happen
just in a single day.
5692.79 - So this is the way you
justify staying out late
5695.11 every once in a while.
- Well, in the meetings
5697.4 you've seen me in,
5698.233 I've done this for five
or six days continuously,
5700.65 but what you didn't see that
when I came back to my home,
5703.45 it took me two weeks
as if I did a jet lag.
5705.97 So I really do suffer for two weeks
5708.28 after doing a six crazy
night of staying up at night,
5712.18 drinking at the wrong time of the day.
5714.06 So it's not that I'm
completely okay with it.
5716.95 When I go back, everything goes back.
5718.57 It takes me actually
literally two weeks to recover
5721.37 from the circadian rhythm meeting
5723.23 that you've seen me
partying at some point.
5725.88 - Which is kind of ironic
that the circadian rhythm-
5727.473 - I know.
- Meaning people are totally
5729.19 disrupting their circadian cycle,
5730.6 but scientists are human beings too.
5732.72 - Right, so I think if you do
it at very little occasions,
5738.39 I think you should not worry too much
5740.99 that this will have lasting impact.
5742.85 And the good news is that if
you readjust your schedule,
5745.98 you could come back to it.
5747.21 The problem is when you
maintain this wrong schedule
5750.33 for a prolonged time
and it becomes chronic,
5753.16 prolonged periods of time,
5754.28 that's when you have the problems
5755.99 and the accumulation of the problems.
5758.17 So when you have sleeping problem,
5760.36 you produce metabolic problem.
5761.76 When you have metabolic problems,
5763.02 you produce lack of exercise.
5764.85 And you could see how things
can spiral out very quickly.
5768.38 And then it would be
hard to come back to it.
5771.06 - Well, certainly sleep disruption is both
5772.94 a symptom of and-
- Yes.
5775.19 - A cause of almost all-
- Absolutely.
5777.62 - Mental health disorders.
- Absolutely.
5779.72 - And certainly the metabolic syndromes
5782.07 that people are talking about
nowadays and all of this,
5785.12 it all funnels back to light.
5788.07 This is what's so remarkable.
- Eventually, yeah.
5790.08 - And so we have these devices,
5791.75 and I use my phone and I use my computer.
5795.21 But do you think that the
mere dimming of the screen
5798.5 or not interacting with screens,
5802.43 say 90 minutes or two
hours before bedtime,
5805.79 according to what we're saying today,
5808.96 this should have a profound effect
5810.59 on all these factors.
- And it does.
5812.22 And I really believe it does.
5813.87 And, again, I think as
Pat did these inventions
5819.49 where you get a pouch where
you put your phone in a pouch.
5822.22 - Mm hm, so, what Samer's
referring to is our friend, Pat,
5826.18 this former Seal Team member,
5828.9 who's also very impressive
person in the landscape
5831.3 of business and family, et cetera.
5832.78 A real superhuman by any
regard has this habit of taking
5838.56 his phone and putting
it into a sealed pouch
5840.97 in the evening.
- Yeah.
5841.868 - So it's basically walled off-
5842.701 - And in his program he sends you actually
5844.971 these sealed pouches.
5847.45 And so that I think is a
great idea because not only
5851.34 it will take away the light from you,
5853.44 but it also take away the distraction
5855.25 because you want to repair and
recover, and sleep does that.
5859.89 And if you have your phone
dinging all the time,
5862.31 or the light flashing from it,
5865.07 you're just not getting enough sleep
5866.647 and you're causing
yourself major problems.
5870.975 - I never asked you
this, but I realized now
5873.2 that I should have long
ago, but I'll ask you now.
5879.13 Why and how did you get
into all this stuff?
5882.41 - Yeah, I mean, honestly, first of all,
5885.14 I wanted to study genetics and I knew
5889.16 I wanted to do PhD in genetics.
5891.87 But I only got accepted in
one university at the time.
5894.53 And I joined the Learning and Memory Lab.
5896.86 And I liked learning and
memory at the beginning,
5898.7 I worked on the snails
on Aplysia californica,
5901.3 and started looking at
learning and memory.
5903.22 But then the same lab was
looking at these daily variation.
5906.74 I was really struck.
5908.43 Like you never think about
it outside of science.
5911.05 It's really struck me that organisms
5914.54 can measure day biologically.
5917.38 That was very shocking to me.
5919.21 And I just really got
attracted and I wanted to see
5922.66 why does this happen?
5924.54 What is the effect of
different times of day?
5926.4 And I just stuck with it.
5927.73 It just, it was mind blowing for me
5930.14 who was in medical school,
5932.01 that I've never heard about it before.
5934.39 You know, it's really amazing medicine,
5936.2 I think still now we are very good
5938.96 at looking at stuff spatially,
5941.17 but we're very bad at
looking at temporal aspects.
5944.65 So we always like to see
images, static images,
5948.3 spatial information.
5949.133 - Right, take an x-ray,
measure a temperature-
5951.044 - Yeah, exactly.
- Measure a blood pressure.
5952.84 - But we don't think of temporal.
5954.87 And you talk to John Hogenesch right now,
5957.45 and he's telling you the
importance of chronomedicine
5960.525 or chromo pharma...
5962.9 Whatever the word is.
5964.07 And it really just getting the drugs
5967.68 at the right time of the
day is going to be essential
5970.16 for our health.
5971.5 - Do you think that's going to
come from using better trackers,
5973.95 like Oura rings, WHOOP
straps, these kinds of things?
5977.34 - I love the trackers,
5978.4 but I think there's even
more exciting discoveries.
5980.84 Now you could take a single blood sample
5982.91 and measure many biological components
5985.61 and figure where you are
in the circadian clock.
5988.15 Something that was very hard to do before.
5990.64 So if you have a marker to know
where you are in the clock,
5993.49 you could actually understand
more the effect of everything;
5996.78 exercise, feeding, light input.
5998.81 - What is the marker?
6000.01 - So there are some papers
from what's her name?
6003.49 Phyllis Zee and from Achim Kramer
6007.01 where they measure multiple RNAs
6008.9 that are known to tell you
what phase of the clock is,
6011.9 or multiple proteins or
biological reactions.
6016.7 And depending on a combination of factors,
6019.23 not a single factor,
6020.17 you could tell where you
are in the circadian clock.
6023.4 So they could instead of
just measuring temperature
6025.92 or melatonin, just one measurement.
6027.9 And melatonin specifically, is
also complicated by the fact
6030.48 that melatonin is affected by light.
6034.157 And temperature, your
temperature and sleep can be
6036.58 easily dissociable, right?
6038.314 When you travel up those
different timezone,
6039.617 you sleep at different times
in the temperature cycle.
6043.33 So having multiple components
measured will give you
6046.69 a better determination
of your circadian phase,
6049.82 and understanding your
circadian phase in humans
6053.25 will telling you what is the
effect of giving certain drugs
6056.05 at certain times of the circadian phase.
6057.74 So, in the future, this
is going to be studied
6060.32 at a much higher level when
you can determine the phase
6063.63 in relation to all the other stuff.
6067.06 - It's striking to me that in
all animals, besides humans,
6072.08 if they deviate too much
from the appropriate exposure
6075.32 to light and light-dark cycle,
6076.9 they essentially don't mate and/or die
6080.5 and/or get killed off.
6082.36 But in humans, we are able
to override that at least
6085.46 to some extent, but the ways
in which we suffer appear to be
6090.33 things like obesity, metabolic syndromes,
6093.99 reproductive syndromes that are accompany
6095.98 the other syndromes, you
know, endocrine syndromes,
6098.4 and mood and depressive disorders.
6101.26 Is there any effort at the
level of the nationally
6105.66 or laboratories that you're aware of
6107.65 to try and use light in order
6109.92 to improve mood and mental health?
6112.44 - I mean, honestly, this is my mantra.
6114.54 This is the thing that I think people,
6117.22 because I say, don't take
a pill, take a photon.
6120.727 And not, I mean, you take pills.
6122.39 That's important.
6123.223 I'm just making it that
really we have an opportunity
6126.93 right now with the incredible
advances of LED lights,
6130.46 of changing spectrum of light,
of regulating intensities.
6135.92 And just for simple changes,
6139.05 you could really improve
sleep-wake cycle, productivity,
6142.94 and still you could actually get more done
6145.57 because as we've talked about,
6147.54 when you have all these messed up,
6149.57 now you have to sleep more,
but your sleep is fragmented.
6152.91 It's not very good.
6154.1 - And you can't focus
when you do sit down-
6155.253 - And you can't focus or
you don't have alertness
6157.522 when you need the alertness.
6159.34 So having all these could allow
you to do even more actually
6164.0 at the end than less.
6165.353 And that's the exciting part it.
6167.97 - One of the questions I
get asked most often about
6170.45 is about ADHD.
6171.73 I think there's a lot of self-prescribed
6174.17 as well as clinically prescribed ADHD.
6176.25 People are having a tremendously
difficult time focusing
6178.9 and not just because they're sleepy,
6180.58 they just can't seem to
anchor their attention.
6182.3 And there could be
multiple reasons for this,
6184.2 but there are now several
clinical trials ongoing
6186.85 using light to try and anchor
people's attention and mood
6190.27 and wellbeing for sake of focus.
6192.0 And I think that while I love this saying
6194.54 that you mentioned, "Take
a photon, not a pill."
6197.69 And with due respect to
the need for pharmacology
6201.51 for some certain people,
6202.743 I think most people just
haven't really dialed in
6206.08 their relationship to light
in a way that allows them
6208.15 to rule out whether or
not they need medication.
6209.743 - Absolutely, absolutely.
6211.34 That's the best way to put it.
6212.67 I can't add to that.
6214.8 - Let's talk about jet lag.
- Mm hm.
6217.62 - But not in the context of,
okay, if somebody's traveling
6220.93 from Europe to Japan
or from the east coast,
6223.27 because that varies tremendously, right?
6225.14 I mean, there's as many
different variations
6227.02 on travel as there are
individuals out there with roles-
6230.147 - Right.
- And jobs, et cetera.
6232.46 But rather, let's talk
about what are the two
6235.12 or three things that people can do
6236.72 to adjust their schedule quickly?
6239.44 Yesterday, I called you and said,
6241.347 "Look, I know somebody
who's traveling six hours.
6244.08 I won't even mention in which direction,
6245.49 'cause I don't want people
to anchor to that example.
6248.16 And you described some very
simple tools of viewing light
6253.79 a little bit earlier than normal
6255.81 and getting on the local
food schedule, et cetera,
6258.63 that would allow them
to shift more quickly.
6260.802 - Exactly.
- And the reason I want to
6261.635 have this conversation is
yes, for the travelers,
6263.81 and for the shift workers,
6265.84 but mostly because of the
fact that you've proven
6270.2 again and again that people are disrupted
6273.66 in their circadian behavior at home.
6276.407 So, aside from what we've
already talked about,
6279.04 how can one adjust
quickly to a new schedule?
6282.4 Like let's say, fall classes are starting,
6284.12 you start a new job or you have a baby
6285.79 or a puppy or whatever,
what is the best way
6288.59 to shift the clock quickly?
6290.22 - So, it's very simple as
we've talked yesterday.
6292.62 So imagine you're in the outside
with no industrial light.
6299.04 If your body thinks
you're in early evening
6302.1 and you see a bright light,
what does this tell you?
6304.97 Oh, wait, this is not early evening yet.
6307.64 It's still early afternoon
or late afternoon.
6311.2 So I have to delay my clock
to go back to late afternoon.
6314.93 So if you get light early in the evening,
6318.17 it delays your clock.
6320.1 So what does that-
- Meaning that makes you
6321.49 want to go to sleep later?
6322.9 - Yes, it delays your clock.
6324.101 So, you're in New York, right?
6327.79 People in Italy have an advanced clock
6329.78 because they are six hours ahead of us.
6333.06 So if you're in New York
and you get light early
6336.517 in the evening, you delay
even further from Italy.
6339.47 So now you're delaying away from Italy.
6342.1 Now the same thing happens.
6343.61 Let's say, you thought dawn came up
6345.73 and you thought it's already dawn,
6347.74 but it was let's say three
o'clock in the morning
6349.83 or four o'clock in the morning.
6350.86 And then you get to
bright light and you say,
6352.737 "Oh, wait a minute.
6353.84 Dawn is not the up yet."
6355.84 So I should advance my clock.
6357.43 Or I'm at night, but I'm
getting bright lights,
6361.46 so I should run because
dawn is already up.
6364.67 So then later in the
night, later in your night,
6369.27 and actually it just
happens that in humans
6371.95 you get a temperature
nadir later in the night,
6374.85 low temperature in your body.
6376.56 After that, lights start
advancing your clock.
6380.06 So if you want to go to Italy,
6381.57 instead of getting light
early in the evening,
6383.47 you want to get light
after the temperature low.
6386.73 So you could advance your clock
even before you go to Italy,
6390.06 and you're catching up to the
Italians just by using light.
6392.89 It's as simple as that.
- Great.
6394.42 - So you could do it for every region.
6396.73 You could calculate how much
they are advanced of you.
6400.01 You could know how much these
light shifts happen per day,
6402.947 and you can calculate what you need to do,
6405.95 very simple math, to adjust
either in direction of delaying
6409.9 if you're going from
New York to California,
6411.81 you want to delay your clock
6413.42 or advancing if you're going
from New York to Italy.
6416.35 - So, in order to make that a visual
6418.61 and because a lot of people
are listening to this,
6420.25 not looking at it on video,
6421.85 we will put a zero cost
downloadable figure of this
6427.01 on the HubermanLab.com website
related to this episode.
6430.3 But I think I can summarize
it in language as well.
6434.44 If I understand correctly,
6435.53 what you're saying is if
your typical wake up time
6439.12 is say, 7:00 a.m., then your
low point in temperature
6443.01 probably occurs somewhere
around 5:00 a.m..
6445.89 - Yeah.
- And if you view light
6447.67 right around then it's
going to essentially
6450.48 advance your clock.
- Yeah.
6451.76 Because then your body thinks,
oh, it's seven o'clock,
6454.66 so advanced your clock
by one to two hours.
6457.04 - But if I were to view
light, say at 3:00 a.m.,
6460.8 then it would probably delay my clock?
6462.72 - Yeah.
- Okay.
6463.93 Yeah, so, and then let's say
I land in a new schedule.
6467.22 I want to adjust to a new schedule.
6468.39 Let's say I didn't manage to do anything
6470.05 with my light viewing before I went.
6471.49 And I didn't anticipate the trip.
6473.53 Suddenly I'm on a new schedule, okay?
6476.24 I was told that one of the
ways to help shift the clock
6479.8 and to avoid gastrointestinal issues
6482.1 is to eat on the local schedule.
6484.51 - Mm hm.
- To start basically behaving
6487.11 like a local.
- Mm hm.
6488.27 - Even though your
circadian clock will take
6490.74 a little bit of time to catch up.
6491.607 - Right, absolutely.
6492.85 But you have to remember the light, right?
6495.41 So, now that we explained it very simply,
6497.99 let's take a very simple example, right?
6500.85 New York to Italy,
that's a simple example.
6503.88 New York time, Italy time,
six hour difference, right?
6506.83 So let's say you fly
from New York at night.
6509.65 You reach Italy at eight
o'clock in the morning.
6511.9 What is the time in your
New York time although you-
6515.51 - Six hours back.
- Six hours back.
6516.343 - It's 2:00 in the morning.
- It's 2:00 a.m..
6518.54 So when you land Italy,
6519.83 you want to avoid light like the plague.
6522.18 Yeah, you could eat,
6523.22 but you really don't
want to get the light.
6524.417 - Right, 'cause otherwise
it's going to delay you.
6526.32 - It's going to delay you, it's
going to send you to California
6528.31 instead of sending you to Italy.
6529.68 - Right, and so this is such a key point.
6531.6 If anyone's confused about this,
6532.97 we will put some diagrams up.
6534.31 But what Samer is saying is so crucial.
6537.77 Just because getting
bright light in your eyes
6540.15 early in the day is really
beneficial when you're at home,
6542.46 when you travel to a new time zone,
6544.97 you have to take into account
what your body thinks.
6550.253 Excuse me, you have to
take into account where
6552.29 your body thinks you are.
- Exactly.
6553.51 - And so if you're looking
at the Italian sunrise,
6555.59 having just flown from New York to Italy
6557.91 and you didn't prepare
for that trip by waking up
6560.05 a little bit earlier in anticipation-
6561.64 - Multiple days, yeah.
- And you view light
6565.03 at 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. Italian time,
6567.59 beautiful Italian sunrise,
6569.4 you are going to delay your clock.
6571.09 You're going to basically throw
yourself back to California,
6573.94 but you are in Italy.
6575.24 You're going to throw your
biology back to California
6577.28 and you are going to be up in
the middle of the Italian night.
6580.05 And you're going to be miserable-
- Miserable.
6582.43 - I'll tell a brief anecdote
6584.15 'cause I called Samer in desperation.
6586.77 A few years ago, I traveled to Abu Dhabi,
6589.06 NYU Abu Dhabi to give a
seminar, 12 hours out of phase.
6592.01 It's a 12 hour flip.
6593.09 And I thought I could just muscle it.
6595.17 I thought I'll get up, just view sunlight
6596.91 when the sun comes up and I fell apart
6600.9 mentally and physically.
6602.08 And Samer came to my rescue.
6604.31 I called him, I said, "I
don't know what to do."
6606.07 And he said, "Go to the
gym at the local dawn,
6612.58 workout, eat and then view
sunlight starting the next day."
6618.38 And that basically got me on the schedule.
6619.92 So I used food and
exercise to adjust myself
6622.21 because my light viewing activity
6624.08 was just completely out of whack.
6625.56 - Yeah, I mean, and we
talked about other details,
6628.13 so you have to calculate it,
but you're absolutely right.
6631.07 I mean, it's very
important to avoid getting
6635.55 the wrong light information
when you're trying
6637.41 to adjust your body because
otherwise it shifts you
6640.108 to the other cycle, absolutely right.
6643.23 - Well, you are one of these
people that has such vigor.
6647.45 It's one of these things
where having known you
6649.67 all these years, you have a
tremendous capacity for work
6652.76 and for soccer, and for
arguing, respectful arguing.
6657.02 And sometimes, you know-
- It's getting worse with age.
6659.9 - Yeah, well, we could
talk about that offline,
6661.84 but I think a lot of your
vigor and a lot of your ability
6665.44 to work hard and focus and
really do so many things
6668.71 at an impressive level is
because you think about
6671.24 these issues and you think about
6673.19 when you're going to be optimal for focus,
6675.61 when you're going to be
optimal for exercise,
6678.306 and the when is the key.
- Right.
6680.167 - And I think a lot of
people live in the landscape
6682.49 of feeling like there's
something broken inside them
6685.18 because they can't focus-
- It's subconscious.
6686.58 - Or they get too-
- It's subconscious, right?
6687.93 Remember it's all subconscious.
6690.02 These effects and, Andrew,
you're absolutely right.
6692.16 Now, honestly, joking aside about age,
6695.22 I really agree with you that
I think part of the reason
6697.99 I'm continuing to be able to do this,
6700.03 that I really think about it.
6702.15 And I make sure that I
keep everything aligned.
6705.83 And that actually helps me a lot.
6707.66 Like I don't suffer in sleep.
6709.93 I don't suffer in waking up.
6711.17 I never use a timer to wake up.
6713.6 I mean, people say, aren't you scared?
6715.2 Like you have to give a
lecture at 8:00 or 7:30.
6718.15 Honestly, I was like, there is no way
6719.5 I'm going to go beyond that.
6721.11 It just, even if I try,
6722.53 I can't sleep beyond 6:00
a.m. in my regular times,
6725.7 it's just, it's not going to happen.
6727.43 By 4:30 my eyes are wide
awake and I'm in bed.
6730.75 It's just system is so aligned, it works.
6735.81 - A lot of times people will
say, how come I go to sleep,
6738.36 I fall asleep fine, but then
I wake up at 3:00 or 4:00
6740.6 in the morning and can't fall back asleep.
6742.77 Is it possible that those
people were supposed
6744.78 to go to bed at 8:00 p.m.?
6746.36 - It's possible.
6747.23 I mean, it is possible.
6748.8 It is also possible that
sometimes people will wake up
6751.58 and go back to sleep.
6752.75 But yeah, I mean, it is possible.
6755.52 Or it's possible that their
clock is completely misaligned,
6758.57 that they are getting
maybe a nap time at night
6761.54 when they are supposed...
6762.373 And then they possibly
feel so sleepy in the day.
6764.45 So, all these are possible combination.
6766.92 - Well, that's an interesting
idea I hadn't considered.
6768.63 So, that what they think is their sleep,
6770.74 their body is so out of whack
with the light-dark cycle,
6773.55 that it's actually a nap.
- A nap.
6775.41 Or the weaker part of the sleep.
6777.12 I mean, you see this when you traveled
6779.84 to different time zone before you adjust.
6782.25 You go to sleep really well,
6783.95 but two hours later, you're fully up.
6786.38 Two hours.
6787.38 If you were so tired and
this is your regular sleep,
6789.89 there's no way you're going
to wake up in two hours.
6793.31 So, then you feel very
sleepy later in the day
6796.38 or something like that.
6797.213 So it depends of how your whole system
6800.15 is aligned to the environment.
6801.6 - That's a very interesting idea.
6804.525 I think that's going to
resonate with a lot of people.
6806.92 I wake up every morning
around 3:00 or 4:00,
6810.61 I generally use the bathroom
6812.49 and then I fall back asleep very deeply.
6814.77 It doesn't seem to disrupt
my daytime wakefulness.
6817.4 And I think a lot of people
obsess over that waking up
6820.39 and worry there's something wrong.
6821.223 - Absolutely.
- Provided they can go back
6822.7 to sleep it's okay.
- Exactly.
6823.543 If you can go use the
bathroom, go back to sleep,
6826.07 that should not be a problem.
6828.17 Maybe with some people, when
they go to use the bathroom,
6830.063 they use very bright light and then
6831.52 they get an alerting signal.
6833.73 So, maybe it could be as simple
as that, that affects you.
6837.92 Maybe when you wake up,
you put tons of light
6840.45 or you start reading your iPad.
6842.49 So there's all these combination
that we still don't know
6845.27 about that could be affecting
their sleep-wake rhythms
6848.08 and their sleep maintenance.
6850.41 - Do you take melatonin?
6853.48 - I don't need it to be honest.
6854.72 In my case, there is no reason to use it
6856.93 because I could guarantee you
that by maybe eight o'clock,
6860.88 my melatonin has already started to go up.
6863.14 And by the time I sleep,
my melatonin is very high
6865.64 because I don't use a lot
of lights after sunset.
6869.15 - And light inhibits melatonin release.
6870.267 - And light really blocks melatonin level.
6873.51 - You hear this myth that
the pineal gland calcifies
6877.45 as we get older.
6878.283 Do you know anything about that?
6879.283 - I mean, I've heard about
that, but I don't know...
6882.46 I mean, there is not very clear evidence
6884.34 that it affects the sleep.
6885.48 I don't know much about it, to be honest.
6887.31 - Yeah, the evidence that
I've seen is that yes,
6889.13 there's some calcification
around the pineal,
6891.26 just because of where
it sits in the brain.
6894.71 It's close to some bony structures.
6897.187 - I see.
- But I don't think
6898.8 there's any evidence that
it has negative effects.
6901.71 - I mean, if you still have,
6903.23 you could measure melatonin
and that should tell you
6905.46 if it has any, it's such
an easy thing to do.
6907.6 - Yeah, I think this is more
of a internet wellness thing
6911.13 that got outside the cage.
- That's possible.
6914.103 I think you're absolutely right.
6915.48 - Yeah, it sounds terrible, calcification
6918.08 of the thing, right?
- Yeah, exactly.
6919.79 Like the heart thing, right?
- Yeah, exactly.
6923.93 Let's talk about seasonality a little bit.
6927.76 I learned, and I don't
know if this is still true,
6932.21 but that most suicides occur
in April, in the spring.
6937.39 I think there's a poem that says,
6938.827 "April is the cruelest month,"
6940.51 I think as the poem begins.
6944.55 Are there data that
suicides are more frequent
6947.26 at particular times of year?
6948.65 And if so, is the spring
that time of year?
6950.88 - Yeah, a lot of people talk about this.
6953.38 And one of the hypothesis
is that the winter month
6957.08 that are very bad for mood,
6959.63 make people not wanting to do anything.
6962.04 And they get into such
deep level of depression
6965.6 that when the sun comes up,
6967.14 they get actually the energy
to act on their depression,
6970.0 which sounds really terrible.
6971.503 And it's just terrible.
- Sounds just terrible.
6972.77 It's terrible.
- So that's the idea
6974.76 that the lack of light
throughout the winter
6977.04 caused them to go into such depression
6979.11 that they don't feel like doing anything.
6981.72 Then when the light comes
in with rigor in the spring,
6985.09 it gives them that after all
the depression they suffered,
6988.25 it gives them that push to take
that sad, final act I guess.
6994.58 - What other seasonal effects have been
6996.33 demonstrated in humans?
6997.49 - Yeah, I mean, I think in
humans, it's not very clear
7000.5 because we don't think about seasonality,
7002.54 but if you start thinking about us,
7005.273 I think we go through
major seasonal changes.
7008.05 I really do.
7008.883 I think our eating pattern
changed across the year.
7011.76 I could tell you that
me thinking about this,
7014.61 there is a clear changes that
happens to me across the year.
7018.52 But for animals, this is really essential
7020.88 because for animals they have
to time their mating behavior
7025.37 was when they deliver their
progeny in the most abundant
7029.39 amount of food and artificial light
7032.03 is causing major disruption.
7033.99 Because if you change
the way these animals
7036.63 are receiving the light information,
7039.02 they either start mating
much earlier or much later
7042.12 and their numbers dwindle.
7043.64 And they get into the
dangers of really completely
7047.04 getting eliminated or extinct.
7049.03 - Well, human birth rates
are definitely going down.
7051.05 - Right, in some-
- I mean, in the US
7053.942 in particular, yeah.
- In some areas, not others.
7055.462 - Not others, right.
7058.06 But are there other effects
of seasonality on humans
7061.42 that we are aware of?
7062.87 - Honestly, you could see it perfectly,
7066.098 I think, in Scandinavia,
7068.418 I mean, you could talk
to people who live in-
7071.32 - Sure, they get seasonal depression.
7073.05 - Well, seasonal depression is one,
7074.66 but actually when you start
asking them questions,
7077.02 they tell you like in the winter
they barely could wake up.
7080.63 They barely have the energy,
before even depression.
7083.55 Even people who don't
get seasonal depression,
7085.96 they will tell you our
energy level is lower.
7088.1 Our ability to go to work is not the same.
7091.3 And in the summer, most people
actually sleep very little.
7094.99 They tell you, we really
can feel like we're manic,
7099.25 we have all this energy
and not in a negative way,
7102.68 in a funny way, right?
7103.72 I mean, but if we want to sleep,
we have to put this curtain.
7107.08 And I think in these situations,
7109.18 you could really appreciate
the seasonality of humans.
7112.6 I think we kind of
destroyed our seasonality
7115.62 because we don't get exposed
to that much natural light.
7119.82 We have all this artificial
light, but I think honestly,
7123.3 one of the thing that is going to happen
7125.41 if they follow your
recommendations about giving light
7128.89 at the same time, giving
food, giving exercise-
7130.66 - Wait, let's be clear, those
are your recommendations.
7132.843 - Well, I mean-
- No, I mean just
7134.88 in fair attribution.
7136.1 - What I'm saying is that
this is going to cause them
7138.54 to also experience some
changes across the season,
7141.71 because now they're going
to see the sun differently.
7144.95 If you're going to go out in
the morning in the summer,
7148.15 you're going to get a much brighter...
7149.53 That's why I don't like
the change in time.
7151.24 I know people think, oh,
because you're biased,
7154.71 'cause I think-
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
7156.08 Sorry, the change in time,
7157.095 are you talking about daylight savings?
7158.42 - Daylight savings.
7159.253 It's such a bad idea because it disrupts
7161.79 that rhythm that you're having.
7164.2 'Cause I think your body,
if you keep that rhythm,
7167.09 you will see the whole seasonality.
7168.86 And I look at it from a different
aspect than other people.
7173.05 And people say I'm biased
because I'm a morning person,
7175.35 and it may be true, but
there are situation-
7179.03 - Secret conspiracy about morning people.
7181.08 - Yeah, but if you think about it, Andrew,
7183.34 there is a situation
where you're getting light
7186.87 perfectly well and then all of a sudden
7188.53 they delayed by one hour because...
7190.69 And then even though it's the summer,
7193.07 your body now, if you're
still not adjusting think,
7195.967 "Oh wait, what happened?
7197.34 What kind of happened?"
7198.55 - Well, I'm glad you're bringing this up
7199.78 because I always thought
what's the big deal, one hour?
7203.95 Right, one hour shift.
7205.12 Spring forward, fall back.
- It's so hard to adjust
7206.77 to one hour actually.
7208.02 - But this goes back to the
beginning of our discussion.
7211.69 It's not just one hour.
- Right.
7213.75 - Because it's one hour
across that one day.
7216.376 - Right.
- But there's this cumulative
7217.39 effect on the clock and
these three elements
7220.66 of your tripartite model.
- Yeah, exactly.
7222.387 - Right, the homeostatic,
sleep and the light,
7224.82 direct effects on mood.
- Exactly and when
7226.27 it's so close, it's
sometimes hard to figure out
7229.65 how to adjust it perfectly because
7232.29 we're already sleep
deprived in our society.
7234.16 And then you shift it by...
7236.887 So it just, it all accumulates
and it has no benefit.
7240.75 - Well, you work at a major
government organization,
7242.86 National Institute of Mental Health.
7244.006 - Yeah.
- Why don't we campaign for-
7245.677 - Honestly, I have no idea.
7247.62 I mean, it makes no sense.
7248.453 - No, I'm saying why don't we go campaign?
7250.11 - Yeah, I would love to.
7250.943 I mean, it makes no sense
to have the summer light
7254.47 goes up at 9:00 p.m.,
7256.44 the light goes down where I
live in Baltimore at 9:00 p.m.
7259.597 And then all of a sudden,
7261.36 when you really want to see
the light longer in the day,
7264.89 you now shift the other way.
7266.267 And now it goes all of
a sudden at 6:00 p.m..
7268.117 Why do you do these drastic changes?
7270.41 Let it blend across the
whole season, you know?
7274.07 Yes, later, earlier at night,
but it's at least consistent.
7278.03 It goes in a very consistent manner.
7280.17 I just don't understand why they do this.
7282.13 It makes no sense.
7283.4 - Well, I think that the reason they do it
7285.9 is because they don't
understand the biology.
7287.82 - Exactly, absolutely.
- Because one hour seems
7289.63 trivial unless you understand-
- It's not.
7291.12 - That the repercussions
of that one hour shift,
7294.53 because what's also clear now
based on what you're saying,
7297.81 is that that one hour shift
taking you out of alignment
7301.04 with the natural light-dark cycle
7302.7 in exactly the wrong direction.
7304.86 - It's pushing people to get even later.
7307.35 - Yeah.
- In the summer,
7308.3 when light is going to
push you later anyway.
7311.04 It doesn't make sense.
7312.2 You put it beautifully, I just
rambled and this is really-
7315.45 - No, no, you made it clear.
7316.413 - I mean, it's like
literally it it made people
7320.31 who are having problem having
an advanced sleep rhythm
7323.78 because they are delayed,
7325.26 now you give them this hour to
make them even more delayed.
7328.16 You push them even later
in the day-night cycle.
7330.88 It just doesn't make sense at all.
7334.45 - I think 2022 should be the year that we
7337.01 abolish daylight savings.
- Oh, man.
7337.843 That would be the day for me honestly.
7341.86 - Well, also, if it has a positive effect
7344.1 on what is essentially an
epidemic of mental health issues
7348.97 and other issues related
to improper interactions
7351.9 with light, that I think
is a well worthwhile cause,
7357.23 and we can explore it.
- Absolutely, absolutely.
7358.94 - [Andrew] So for once we're
going to fight with another group.
7361.805 - Common, I would do to do that.
7362.638 - [Andrew] A common battle as
opposed to with one another.
7364.297 - I mean, the circadian people honestly,
7365.853 to give them credit, have
been trying for years
7368.37 to abolish daylight saving.
7370.02 - Yeah, the problem is they
all go to sleep at 9:00 p.m.
7372.45 and wake up at 4:00 a.m.,
so we never see them.
7374.41 - That's right, that's right.
7375.75 - No, the circadian community
has done an amazing job
7379.24 of figuring out what we need.
- Right.
7382.88 - And then the challenge of course,
7384.36 is making sure that
people get what they need.
7387.14 - Right.
- And making sure
7388.15 that at a societal level,
we're not vaulting ourselves
7391.67 into the wrong direction.
- And the biggest problem
7393.07 is that the late waking
people, they think that really,
7398.23 and I'm going to try to
put it in a better way now,
7400.71 they think, oh, because
you're a morning person,
7402.73 you want to see the sun early.
7404.13 So you want me to suffer it dropping late,
7407.33 but that's not the case.
7409.06 Because what happens is
when they shift it back
7412.8 after the daylight saving,
7414.67 now they're going to make
you suffer really badly
7416.82 because now it's going to be earlier.
7419.46 - Right, in the fall.
- In the fall when there
7421.295 is not enough light.
- Yeah, that's right.
7422.177 - And they keep it the same way.
7423.83 So to try to convince them
that actually this at the end
7427.31 causes more trouble
when you need the light
7430.15 for your late schedule in the fall,
7432.89 when they shift it back.
7434.49 Then they say, keep it
daylight saving all the time.
7437.02 And that has been proven
that it's very bad.
7440.7 Like people have done studies
that literally two areas
7444.03 close to each others and
areas that were the whole year
7447.54 on daylight saving has much more problems
7450.56 even in cancer rates and depression.
7452.61 So you don't want to do that.
7454.13 So that's what trying to convince people
7456.87 that you need to prevent that switch,
7460.27 and you don't need daylight saving at all.
7462.85 That's where the problem happens.
7465.1 - Interesting.
7466.22 I had not thought about that, but yes,
7468.33 you late risers that in the
fall, when it's the fall back,
7472.53 as they say, spring forward, fall back,
7473.88 you dial back the clock,
7475.28 it's really compounding the problem
7477.44 that already exists.
- Exactly.
7479.57 And it's really nice if you think,
7480.94 if you keep it consistent in the spring,
7483.12 you get the equinox and then
the day starts going up,
7487.95 and then even in the
summer it start going down,
7489.47 and then the fall you get the
other equinox and go back.
7492.46 So it's very symmetrical, right?
7494.66 It goes into short day,
longer, long, long, long, long,
7497.93 and then short day again.
7499.47 But now you're getting
these bumps in both sides
7502.4 of the spring and fall.
7504.17 Why would you do that?
7505.21 Something that is beautifully symmetrical,
7507.49 beautifully smooth, you're
putting bumps into it.
7510.06 - Well, and not just
beautiful because it's there,
7513.11 but it evolved.
7514.9 I mean, essentially this is the system-
7515.964 - It's natural.
- We evolved in for hundreds
7517.688 of thousands of years.
- This is the seasonality.
7518.521 The most even apart
from the exact equator,
7521.33 every part of the earth has seasonality.
7525.27 - I want to briefly touch
on something which is
7527.87 individual and genetic variation
7529.76 in the sensitivity to light.
- Yeah.
7531.89 - So not chronotype, but first of all,
7535.49 a very basic question.
7537.58 Do people with light
eyes, light colored eyes,
7542.25 are they more sensitive
to light than people
7544.23 with darker pigmented eyes?
7546.05 - I mean, honestly, it makes
sense they will be more
7548.69 because if you think of my dark pupil,
7551.36 it's blocking more light.
7552.81 So, if you have light pupil,
7555.75 yes, for vision, it may
not be very obvious,
7558.03 but for something that is
measuring the amount of light,
7560.46 you're getting more light than me.
7562.43 So you would probably need
less light to be effective
7566.38 as somebody who's darker.
7568.63 And that maybe could explain
why sometimes lighter people
7571.71 say, I don't want to go
into very bright conditions
7574.08 because it's really bright.
- Yeah, I can't even
7577.36 be at a cafe with one of
these reflective tables,
7579.83 like a metal table.
- Right.
7580.85 - Unless I have very dark sunglasses on.
7582.681 - Exactly.
- It's so bright
7583.514 it's painful for me.
- Right, right.
7584.712 - Whereas some people like
you, we've sat outside
7585.87 and had meals and you're like fine.
7588.24 I assumed it was kind of
Jordanian toughness versus-
7590.457 - No, no, no, it's really
the pupil blocks more light.
7593.23 So I think it is possible that
it's as simple as the pupil
7597.05 blocking more light can have sensitivity,
7599.093 but your question is also goes deeper.
7601.52 Are there more sensitivity differences?
7604.57 And my understanding would be
I would think that it may be,
7607.93 depends on how effective your cells
7610.59 are in responding to light,
how healthy your ipRCGs are.
7616.13 But there's not many studies to show that.
7618.21 What is really clear that is happening
7620.45 is that patients with bipolar,
7623.54 they seem to have different
sensitivities to light.
7626.07 So it seems that at least people
7627.97 who have psychological changes,
7632.42 they may have differences to
the sensitivity of light, so.
7637.29 - Are those differences
in a particular direction?
7640.05 - I don't remember the exact data.
7641.87 - We can look it up, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
7645.47 - And people have heard
me say this at nauseum
7647.47 to the point where they
actually roll their eyes,
7649.28 but that these are the
only two pieces of brain,
7652.23 I'm pointing to my eyes, folks,
7653.36 that are outside the cranial vault.
7655.04 - Absolutely.
- They are two pieces of brain
7656.35 that it basically inform
the brain about whether
7659.18 or not to be alert or asleep.
- Absolutely.
7660.97 - But you can imagine that
those two little pieces of brain
7663.12 that we call eyes would
have genetic variations.
7666.753 - Right.
- Of course eye color
7667.586 is genetically determined,
7671.56 that there would be
genetic variations based on
7673.75 whether or not your ancestry
evolved near the equator
7676.86 or further from the equator, right?
7678.643 I mean, you see more
blue eyes in Scandinavia,
7681.202 than you do at the equator.
- Absolutely, I mean,
7682.035 it's the lack of light that
said you need less inhibition
7686.05 because there's not enough light, right?
7687.66 So that's the idea of the changing color.
7691.52 So, yeah, I totally agree with you.
7693.72 I mean, I think this is an
area that will be studied later
7696.88 and will be empirically determined.
7699.61 The problem we have in
this field right now,
7702.2 which I think is the biggest problem,
7704.41 is we don't have a way
to measure the ipRCGs
7707.77 sensitivities in humans.
7709.24 So we still like, it's easy to measure
7712.1 your rod cone function if
you go to an optometrist,
7715.09 they measure all the details, right?
7717.01 Contrast detection.
- You look at the chart,
7718.73 you get out the Snellen Chart.
- Yeah, exactly.
7719.76 - You look at the letters of the DMV.
7721.43 - Yeah.
- Yeah.
7722.29 - But for the non subconscious,
7724.61 we still don't have a good
measuring systems to figure out
7728.88 what is Andrew's sensitivity?
7730.65 What is Samer's sensitivity?
7732.05 What is this person's sensitivity?
7733.48 And I think we're starting to
work on something like that
7736.61 to hopefully develop these techniques.
7738.44 But till we develop them,
7740.3 it's going to be very hard to figure out
7742.47 if there is a sensitivity difference?
7744.18 How do they relate?
7745.31 And on men and woman?
7748.06 Dark and light?
7749.4 And all that, normal versus
psychologically affect,
7753.28 and stuff like that.
7754.53 - Fascinating.
7756.15 And every time you talk, I learn so much.
7759.98 It's in the best way, the
best sense of the term,
7764.624 it's a waterfall of knowledge.
7767.47 As a final question,
7768.82 I have a question about
sensitivity of a whole other kind,
7772.53 and that's the sensitivity to spicy food.
7776.55 Now, the reason I'm asking this question,
7779.01 what seemingly out of the blue
is that I made the mistake
7782.62 once of having Samer cook for me.
7785.34 And I said, "Not too spicy."
7788.46 And he said, "Okay, not too spicy."
7790.67 He actually said, "Okay, not too spicy."
7792.6 And it almost killed me.
7795.74 Like it was like two or three days.
7797.98 So you know a lot about biology
outside the visual system,
7801.97 light, et cetera.
7802.9 You've been around a while.
7805.42 Are there known genetic
or inherited of any kind
7809.75 sensitivities to spicy food?
7812.27 To things like red peppers and capsaicin?
7814.24 Because what you call mild, my friend,
7818.07 almost put me into the hospital.
7820.48 - I think this is similar
to you swimming in the ocean
7823.05 and I need to go develop
the pain tolerance to do it.
7824.38 - Okay, true, true, I
like cold water swims
7826.66 and Samer's not a fan.
- Yeah.
7827.75 - But that's going to change.
7829.314 It's adaptable.
- These are adaptable.
7831.514 - That's going to change.
- That's my belief.
7832.74 Before I met Rejji, I was like you.
7834.78 And once I started eating
a lot of spicy food,
7837.51 I lost touch of how spicy my food is.
7840.61 So I nearly killed you, Andrew,
and I apologize for that.
7843.26 - I forgive you.
7844.093 So, basically what you're
saying is that marriage
7845.5 toughened you up?
- Toughened me up, exactly.
7848.26 - [Andrew] Maybe that's the solution.
7849.22 - That's what you need, yeah.
7851.42 - Samer, this has been an amazing march
7855.29 through the importance of light,
7857.3 not just for regulating
sleep and wakefulness,
7859.56 but also for food timing,
the interactions with mood,
7863.6 the interactions with exercise.
7865.61 I'm certain that people are
going to start thinking about
7869.07 how to change their
relationship with light
7871.28 as a way to anchor
everything that they do.
7874.74 And that's important to their health.
7876.15 And I just on behalf of all of them,
7878.31 and just directly from me as your friend
7880.83 and as a colleague for many
years now, I just want to say,
7884.1 thank you for the
incredible work you're doing
7886.21 and for sharing it with us.
7887.63 - Thank you so much.
7888.463 And I actually now thinking
about all of this, and you said,
7891.71 I should write a book.
7892.66 I should write a book and call
it "The Tripartite Model."
7895.67 I think that would put all
these components together,
7898.36 it would be very interesting
to do at some point.
7901.44 - You should write a book.
7903.36 They'll probably try and
change the title to like,
7905.117 "Food, Mood and You," or something.
7908.78 But you can put in little
print The Tripartite Model
7911.24 or whatever, but regardless
of what it's called,
7915.26 you absolutely should write a book.
7917.06 And so if you'd like
Samer to write a book,
7920.48 or if you'd like to learn more about him,
7921.82 let's talk a little bit about
where people can find you.
7923.81 Your laboratory is at
the National Institutes
7925.26 of Mental Health.
7926.4 He is Head of the Chronobiology Unit,
7928.0 all these things as
I've mentioned earlier,
7930.03 but you are active on
Twitter and Instagram.
7933.51 - Right.
- So, what is your
7935.09 Twitter handle?
- It's @SamerHattar.
7938.2 - And we will provide a link
for that in the show notes.
7941.82 - Yes, the Twitter @SamerHattar,
7943.726 and I think the same for Instagram.
7945.34 Yeah, actually.
- And Samer has been
7947.62 coaxed onto Instagram, so he
does post from time to time,
7950.44 mostly pictures of food
that is incredibly spicy,
7955.1 but also information about chronobiology.
7957.89 He comes on for an
Instagram Live every once
7959.78 in a while with me.
7961.01 So, definitely give him a
follow there and on Twitter.
7964.223 And I'm sure that he'll be
happy to answer questions
7969.054 and entertain any and all
discussions about chronobiology.
7973.76 - Absolutely, yeah.
7974.82 And light, yeah.
7977.29 - Great, thank you, Samer.
7978.36 - Awesome, thank you, Andrew.
7979.92 - Thank you for joining
me for my conversation
7982.23 with Dr. Samer Hattar.
7983.76 I hope you found it as interesting
and informative as I did.
