0.36 - Welcome to The Huberman Lab Podcast
2.31 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
6.481 [upbeat guitar music]
9.3 I'm Andrew Huberman
10.41 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.11 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.06 Today, we are talking about
obsessive-compulsive disorder
18.08 or OCD.
19.56 We are also going to talk
20.55 about obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder which,
23.91 as you will soon learn, is distinct
25.89 from obsessive-compulsive disorder.
28.11 In fact, many people that
refer to themselves or others
30.45 as obsessive or compulsive
or quote-unquote,
33.18 having OCD or OCD about
this or OCD about that
37.26 do not have clinically diagnosable OCD,
40.41 rather, many people have
obsessive-compulsive
43.05 personality disorder.
44.94 However, there are many
people in the world
47.52 that have actual OCD,
and for those people,
50.94 there's a tremendous amount of suffering.
52.65 In fact, OCD turns out to be number seven
55.98 on the list of most
debilitating illnesses,
58.68 not just psychiatric
illnesses, but of all illnesses
62.1 which is remarkable and
somewhat frightening.
65.22 The good news is thanks to
the fields of psychiatry,
68.76 psychology, and science in general,
71.34 there are now excellent
treatments for OCD.
74.04 We're going to talk about
those treatments today.
76.44 Those treatments range
from behavioral therapies,
78.96 to drug therapies, and brain stimulation,
82.26 and even some of the more
holistic or natural therapies.
85.89 As you'll soon learn, for certain people,
88.11 they may want to focus more
on the behavioral therapies,
90.9 whereas for others, more
on the drug-based therapies
94.26 and so on and so forth.
95.91 One extremely interesting
and important thing
97.65 I learned from this episode
99.12 is that the particular
sequence that behavioral
101.91 and/or drug and/or holistic
therapies are applied
104.91 is extremely important.
107.16 In fact, the outcomes of studies
108.72 often depend on whether not people start
110.64 on drug treatment and then follow
111.99 with cognitive behavioral
treatment or vice versa.
114.81 We're going to go into all those details
116.34 and how they relate to
different types of OCD,
119.16 because it turns out there are indeed
120.48 different types of
obsessions and compulsions,
122.94 and the age of onset for
OCD, and so on and so forth.
127.11 What I can assure you is
by the end of this episode,
129.33 you'll have a much greater understanding
131.16 of what OCD is and what it isn't
133.68 and what obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder is
136.74 and what it is not.
138.06 And you'll have a rich array
of different therapy options
141.72 to explore in yourself or in others
144.99 that are suffering from OCD.
146.28 And if neither you or others that you know
148.56 suffer from OCD or obsessive-compulsive
150.42 personality disorder,
the information covered
152.88 in today's episode will
also provide insight
155.52 into how the brain and nervous system
157.38 translate thought into action generally.
159.93 And also, you're going to learn a lot
162.18 about goal-directed behavior generally.
164.82 My hope is that by the end of the episode
166.32 you'll both understand a
lot about this disease state
168.99 that we call OCD, you will
have access to information
172.71 that will allow you to
direct treatments to yourself
174.75 or others in better ways,
176.67 and that you will gain greater insight
178.8 into how you function and
how human beings function
181.26 in general.
182.13 The Huberman Lab Podcast
is proud to announce
184.11 that we've partnered with
Momentous Supplements.
186.33 We've done that for several reasons.
187.62 First of all, the quality
of their supplements
189.66 is exceedingly high.
191.22 Second of all, we wanted
to have a location
193.29 where you could find all of
the supplements discussed
195.3 on The Huberman Lab Podcast
in one easy-defined place.
198.54 You can now find that place
at livemomentous.com/huberman.
202.89 In addition, Momentous
Supplements ship internationally,
206.25 something that a lot of
other supplement companies
208.11 simply do not do.
209.37 So that's terrific whether
or not you live in the US
211.26 or you live abroad.
212.34 Right now, not all of the supplements
214.11 that we'd discuss on The
Huberman Lab Podcast are listed,
216.96 but that catalog of supplements
218.61 is being expanded very rapidly
220.35 and a good number of them
that we've talked about,
222.09 some of the more prominent
ones for sleep and focus
224.49 and other aspects of
mental and physical health
226.74 are already there.
227.573 Again, you can find them at
livemomentous.com/huberman.
230.43 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
232.05 that this podcast is separate
233.28 from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.
235.44 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
237.27 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
239.547 and science-related tools
to the general public.
242.52 In keeping with that theme,
I'd like to thank the sponsors
244.95 of today's podcast.
246.42 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
248.46 Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin-mineral
250.71 probiotic drink that also has adaptogens
253.02 and digestive enzymes.
254.64 I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012
257.4 and I've taken it every day since
258.69 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
261.15 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens
262.89 and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens
264.42 once or twice a day is that it covers
266.34 all of my foundational nutritional needs.
268.41 In fact, when people ask me,
269.243 "what's the one supplement I should take?"
271.11 I always say Athletic Greens
272.7 because by taking Athletic Greens,
274.35 you give support to your immune system,
275.97 to your endocrine system,
to your nervous system
278.19 and to the so-called gut-brain axis
280.08 and the gut microbiome.
281.46 As many of you've probably heard,
282.9 our gut, meaning everywhere from our mouth
285.21 down all the way through our intestine,
286.68 is populated by trillions
of little microbacteria
289.38 that support the different
systems of our body.
292.56 Athletic Greens has the
probiotics that support
294.57 the microbiome, and in
turn, support things
296.49 like mood, endocrine function,
immune system, and so on.
299.76 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
301.14 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
303.57 and claim their special offer.
304.86 They'll give you five free travel packs
306.69 plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
309.45 Many people are deficient in vitamin D3
311.46 and in general, vitamin D3 and K2
313.47 support a huge number of factors
315.78 in your brain and body
that support your immediate
317.55 and long-term health.
318.69 Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
321.51 to claim their special offer.
322.98 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Thesis.
325.5 Thesis makes custom nootropics,
327.81 and frankly, I'm not a big fan
329.43 of the word nootropics.
330.99 I've said that on various podcasts
332.43 and on social media posts
333.54 and the reason I'm not a
fan of the word nootropics
335.03 is it means smart drugs.
337.11 But as a neuroscientist,
338.73 I know that we don't have
circuits in the brain
341.28 or chemicals in the brain for being smart,
343.41 we have circuits in the brain for focus
345.54 and for task switching and for creativity,
347.55 and oftentimes those circuits
differ from one another
349.92 although they collaborate to create things
351.63 that we think of as intelligence
353.34 or focus or creativity, et cetera.
355.62 Thesis understands this
and for that reason,
357.72 has developed custom nootropics
359.46 that match your particular goals
361.38 and to your particular biology.
363.78 They give you the opportunity to try
364.89 several different blends
over the course of a month
366.87 and discover which ones work best for you
368.55 and which ones don't.
370.08 In addition to that personalization,
371.64 they take it a step further
by offering free consultations
374.01 with a coach to help you
optimize your experience
376.41 and dial in your perfect formulas.
378.78 I've been using Thesis
for about eight months now
381.09 and I can confidently
say that their nootropics
383.43 are the best that I've ever used.
385.23 My go-to formula is the Clarity Formula
387.51 or the Motivation Formula
388.8 when I'm going to work or work out,
390.54 meaning when I'm going to
do focus cognitive work,
392.67 or I'm going to exercise.
393.72 I also like their Energy
Formula prior to exercise.
396.45 To get your own personalized
nootropics starter kit,
398.43 go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
401.58 You can take a three minute
quiz that will help match you
404.13 to the best custom
nootropics to start with.
406.32 And Thesis will send you
four different formulas
408.48 to try in that first month.

416.76 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
419.4 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
421.23 that have cooling, heating,
and sleep tracking capacity.
424.35 I've talked many times on this podcast
425.91 and another podcast and on social media
428.22 about the critical relationship
429.93 between temperature and sleep.
432.51 Generally speaking, your
body temperature has to drop
434.94 by about one to three
degrees in order to get
436.98 into and to stay in deep sleep.
439.11 And waking up has a lot to do
440.82 with an increase in body temperature
442.32 of about one to three degrees.
444.06 So for many people like
myself who run warm
446.01 during the night, I find myself waking up
447.45 in the middle of the night.
448.53 However, recently I started using
449.76 an Eight Sleep mattress cover
451.047 and by programming in
the specific temperatures
453.21 that work for me across the night,
455.07 I'm staying asleep through the whole night
456.69 and as a consequence, I'm feeling
far better during the day,
459.39 much more focus, alertness, et cetera,
460.95 all the great things that come
462.24 from getting excellent sleep consistently.
465.15 The Pro Pod Cover by Eight Sleep
466.59 is their most advanced
solution on the market
468.3 for thermal regulation during sleep,
469.8 that's the one I use.
471.03 It pairs dynamic cooling and heating
472.44 with biometric tracking.
473.55 It also has this really nice feature where
475.89 your mattress basically
vibrates a little bit
477.66 right upon waking, I like that as well.
479.85 You can cover any mattress with it.
481.26 You can start sleeping as
cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit,
483.87 or as warm as 110 degrees Fahrenheit,
485.85 And that range is available to you
487.32 simply because Eight Sleep understands
489.12 that people have a tremendous range
490.89 in natural body temperatures
and sleeping environments.
494.01 If you want to try Eight Sleep,
495.03 you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

509.16 Let's talk about OCD or
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
512.73 First of all, as the name suggests,
514.86 OCD includes thoughts or obsessions
517.62 and compulsions which are actions.
520.56 The obsessions and the
compulsions are often linked.
523.47 In fact, most of the time,
524.79 the obsessions and the
compulsions are linked
526.71 such that the compulsion, the behavior,
529.47 is designed to relieve the obsession.
532.68 However, one of the hallmark themes
534.57 of obsessive-compulsive disorder
536.61 is that the obsessions are intrusive.
539.16 People don't want to have them.
540.93 They don't enjoy having them.
542.16 They just seem to pop into people's minds
544.02 and they seem to pop into
their mind recurrently.
546.72 And the compulsions, unlike
other sorts of behaviors,
551.52 provide brief relief to the obsession,
554.64 but then very quickly reinforce
or strengthen the obsession.
558.87 This is a very key theme to realize
561.0 about obsessive-compulsive disorder
562.53 so I'm just going to repeat it again.
564.03 These two features, first,
the fact that the obsessions
566.85 are intrusive and recurrent,
569.94 as well as the fact that the
compulsions, the behaviors,
572.88 provide, if anything, only
brief relief for the obsessions,
576.75 but in most cases simply serve to make
578.61 the obsessions stronger
are the hallmark features
582.0 of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
583.71 And it turns out to be very important
585.18 to keep these in mind as we go forward,
587.55 not just because they define
obsessive-compulsive disorder,
590.52 but they also define
the sorts of treatments
592.29 that will and will not work
593.97 for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
595.68 And then once you understand a little bit
597.27 about the neural circuitry underlying
598.8 obsessive-compulsive disorder,
600.15 which we'll talk about in a few moments,
602.04 then you will clearly understand
603.78 why being a quote-unquote,
obsessive person
606.12 or having obsessive-compulsive personality
608.46 is not the same as OCD.
610.71 In fact, we can leap ahead a little bit
612.63 and compare and contrast OCD
614.7 with obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder
617.16 along one very particular set of features.
620.16 Again, I'll go into this
in more detail later,
622.17 but it's fair to say
that OCD is characterized
625.86 by these recurrent and
intrusive obsessions.
628.53 And as I mentioned before,
the fact that those obsessions
630.51 get stronger as a function of people
633.09 performing certain behaviors.
634.53 So unlike an itch that you feel,
636.6 and then you scratch
it and it feels better,
638.34 OCD is more like an itch that
you feel, you scratch it,
640.59 and the itch intensifies.
642.87 That contour or that pattern of behaviors
645.51 and thoughts interacting is very different
647.88 than obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder,
650.34 which mainly involves a sense
of delayed gratification
654.06 that people want and somewhat enjoy
656.55 because it allows them to function better
658.35 or more in line with how they would like
659.88 to show up in the world.
661.29 So again, OCD has mainly
to do with obsessions
664.41 that are intrusive and recurrent,
665.55 whereas obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder
667.98 does not have that
intrusive feature to it.
670.26 People do not mind, or in fact,
672.45 often invite or like the
particular patterns of thought
675.63 that lead them to be compulsive
along certain dimensions.
678.57 So leaving aside obsessive-compulsive
680.28 personality disorder for the moment,
682.32 let's focus a bit more on OCD and define
684.75 how it tends to show up in the world.
686.88 First of all, OCD is extremely common.
691.17 In fact, current estimates
are that anywhere
693.51 from 2.5% to as high as 3
696.75 or even 4% of people suffer from true OCD,
701.01 that is an astonishingly high number.
703.89 Now, the reason the range is so big,
705.9 2.5% all the way up to
3, or maybe even 4%,
709.2 is that a lot of the features of OCD
712.23 go unnoticed both in
the clinician's office
716.19 and simply because people don't report it
718.89 and don't talk about it.
720.33 In fact, it is possible to have recurrent
722.16 and intrusive obsessions and not engage
724.65 in the sorts of behaviors
that would ever allow
726.54 people to notice that somebody has OCD.
729.33 That can be because some
of the intrusive thoughts
732.48 don't actually lead to overt behaviors
734.43 like hand washing or checking
735.84 that other people would notice.
737.28 It can also be because people learn
739.98 to disguise or hide their obsessions
742.59 and their compulsions out of shame
744.33 or fear of looking strange
or whatever it might be
747.66 such that they have these obsessive
749.61 and intrusive thoughts, and
they do little micro-behaviors
752.58 like they might tap their
fingers on their thigh
754.77 as a way to avoid, at
least in their own mind,
757.41 something catastrophic happening.
759.18 That might seem crazy to you,
760.85 it might seem bizarre, but
this is the sort of thing
763.14 that operates in a lot of people.
765.45 And I really want to emphasize this
766.98 because the clinical
literature that are out there
770.1 really point to the fact
that many people have OCD,
774.06 full blown OCD, and never report it
776.16 because of the kind of shame and hiding
777.96 associated with it.
779.52 Another thing to point out is that OCD
782.31 is extremely debilitating.
784.74 I mentioned this a few minutes ago,
786.15 but OCD is currently
listed as number seven
789.03 in terms of the most
debilitating illnesses,
791.61 not just mental illnesses or disorders,
795.03 but all types of illnesses
796.71 including things like asthma
and cancer, et cetera.
799.53 So you can imagine with that
standing at number seven,
803.34 that it is both extremely common
805.65 and extremely debilitating.
807.12 And as a consequence, it's now realized
809.64 that many hours, days,
weeks, months, or even years
813.99 of work performance or showing up at work
817.05 of relational interactions really suffer
819.78 as a consequence of people having OCD.
821.49 So this is a vital problem
that the scientific
823.8 and psychiatric and psychological
communities understand.
826.44 And it's one of the reasons
that I'm doing this podcast.
829.56 And of course, I received
a ton of interest in OCD
832.41 because of this incredibly
high incidence of OCD
835.047 and how debilitating it is.
836.97 We could go really deep into
why it's so debilitating.
840.18 I don't want to spend
too much time on that
841.41 because I think most of
that is pretty obvious,
843.15 but some of it is not.
844.53 For instance, one of the
things that makes OCD
846.69 so debilitating is, of course,
848.37 the shame that we talked about before.
850.2 But it's also the fact that
when people are focusing
853.02 on their obsessions and their compulsions,
854.64 they're not able to focus on other things.
856.59 That's simply the way
that the brain works.
858.0 We're not able to focus on
too many things at once.
860.43 The other thing is that
OCD takes a lot of time
863.61 out of people's lives.
865.35 With recurrent intrusive
thoughts happening
867.72 at very high frequency, or
even at moderate frequency,
870.06 people are spending a lot of
time thinking about this stuff
872.85 and they're thinking about the behaviors
874.77 they need to engage in, and
then engaging in the behaviors,
876.87 which as I mentioned before,
877.89 just serve to strengthen the compulsions
879.207 and so they're not actually
doing the other things
881.58 that make us functional human beings
883.35 like commuting to work or doing homework
885.72 or doing work or listening
when people are talking
888.03 or interacting or sports or working out,
889.71 all the things that make
for a rich quality life
892.74 are taken over by OCD in many cases.
896.04 So while that might be obvious to some,
897.84 I'm not sure that it's
obvious to everybody
899.55 just how much time OCD can occupy.
902.55 Another thing you'll
soon learn is that sadly,
905.25 a lot of the obsessions
and compulsions in OCD
907.89 often relate to taboo topics.
909.72 And that's because the
general categories of OCD
912.75 fall into three different bins,
915.48 checking obsessions and compulsions,
917.85 repetition obsessions and compulsions,
920.25 and order obsessions and compulsions.
922.41 The checking ones are somewhat obvious,
924.0 checking the stove or checking the locks,
926.31 which I think we all tend to do.
927.72 I'm somebody typically
I'll head off to the car
930.51 to commute to work and I'll think,
932.097 did I lock the front door,
933.15 and I'll go back once,
934.59 but I won't go back twice or 50 times.
936.84 People with OCD will often
go back 20 or 30 times
940.32 before they'll actually allow
themselves to drive off.
942.51 And then it's a real challenge for them
944.79 to continue to drive off
and discard with the idea
947.34 that they didn't check the stove
948.57 or they didn't check the locks
949.65 or they didn't check
something else critical.
952.32 Repetition obsessions and compulsions,
954.69 obviously can dovetail
with the the checking ones,
957.87 but those tend to be
things like counting off
960.03 of a certain number of numbers,
962.25 like one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,
964.11 seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
965.52 People perform that repeatedly,
repeatedly, repeatedly,
968.4 or feel that they have to.
969.853 I remember years ago
watching a documentary about
973.23 the band, The Ramones, right?
975.0 Most people heard of The Ramones, right?
976.38 Jeans, T-shirts, aviator glasses,
978.18 everyone had to change
their last name to Ramone.
979.74 They weren't actually all related
981.0 to one another, by the way.
982.26 You had to change your
last name to Ramone.
983.52 The Ramones had one band member
985.59 who was admittedly and known
to others as having OCD.
989.49 And during that documentary,
which I forget the name,
992.07 I think it was called,
993.42 can't remember, anyway,
994.41 can't remember, hippocampal lapse there,
997.14 but in this documentary,
998.58 the band members describe Joey Ramone
1001.76 as leaving hotels, walking down the stairs
1004.97 to the parking lot, but then having
1006.11 to walk up and down them
seven or eight times,
1007.91 and sometimes getting out of the van again
1009.53 and walking up and down
them seven or eight times
1011.197 and it always had to be a
certain number of times,
1013.61 given a certain number of stairs.
1015.08 This appears, quote-unquote, crazy,
1016.7 but of course, we don't want
to think of this as crazy.
1019.01 This is somebody who very
likely had full blown OCD.
1023.24 Now that particular
example, believe it or not,
1025.19 is not all that uncommon.
1027.86 It just so happens that that example
1029.72 entailed certain compulsions and behaviors
1031.67 that were overt and that
other people could see.
1034.82 And you can imagine how
that would prevent somebody
1036.89 from moving about their daily life easily.
1038.57 A lot of people, as I mentioned before,
1040.37 have obsessions and
compulsions that they hide
1042.77 and they do these little micro behaviors,
1044.3 or they'll just count off in their head
1046.43 as opposed to generating
some sort of walking up
1048.65 and downstairs or tapping
or things of that sort.
1051.44 So we have checking, we have repetition,
1053.0 and then there's order.
1054.65 Order oftentimes is thought of
1057.08 as putting cleanliness
1059.48 or making sure everything is aligned
1061.49 and perfect and orderly.
1063.74 And oftentimes that is the case,
1065.39 but there are other forms of order
1066.74 that people with OCD can focus on
1068.99 in a obsessive and compulsive way.
1071.72 Things like incompleteness, the idea that
1074.69 one can't walk away from something
1076.37 or stop doing something
because something's not right
1078.65 or complete in that picture.
1080.57 It could be the way the table is set.
1082.97 It could be the way that
something's written on a page.
1085.1 It could be an email.
1086.78 Again, now we're still talking
about OCD, the disorder.
1089.69 We're not talking about
obsessive-compulsive
1091.79 personality disorder.
1093.86 I'm aware of, well, I'll just be direct,
1096.2 several colleagues of mine
and it's just remarkable,
1098.51 the order in their emails.
1100.28 Every email is perfect,
punctuated, perfect,
1103.31 grammar, perfect,
everything's spaced perfect.
1105.92 Do they have OCD?
1106.82 Well, they might, they might not.
1107.99 How would I know unless
they disclose that to me.
1111.35 But they might have obsessive-compulsive
1113.6 personality disorder, or
they just might be able
1116.18 to generate a lot of order
1117.92 and they have a lot of discipline
1119.21 around the way they write,
and the way they present
1120.98 any communication with anybody at all.
1123.68 So if somebody has a OCD
that's in the domain of order,
1127.88 it could be incompleteness
and the constant feeling
1131.0 of something not being completed
1132.89 and a need to complete it.
1134.27 It can also be in terms of symmetry,
1136.19 that everything be aligned
in symmetric in some way.
1138.74 This could be seen perhaps in young kids.
1141.92 This is one example that
I read in the literature
1144.05 of children that need to
arrange their stuffed animals
1146.6 in exact same order every day
1149.57 and in a particular order to the point
1152.27 where if you were to move
the little stuffed frog
1154.64 over next to the stuffed rabbit,
1155.93 that the child would have
an anxiety reaction to that
1159.68 and feel literally
compelled, driven to fix that
1163.52 maybe even multiple times
over and over again.
1166.4 We'll talk about OCD in children
1167.96 versus adults in a little bit.
1169.4 And then the other aspect of order,
1171.65 which is a little bit less than intuitive,
1173.9 is this notion of disgust,
1175.61 this idea that something is contaminated.
1177.47 So we often think about OCD
and hand washing behavior
1181.28 in response to people feeling
1182.81 that something is contaminated,
1184.25 a space, a towel, et cetera,
1186.29 or even simply somebody else's hand
1188.51 and so they're unwilling
to shake somebody's hand.
1190.82 You can imagine how these
different bins of obsessions
1193.52 and compulsions, checking
repetition and order
1196.82 be extremely debilitating
depending on how severe
1199.13 they are and how many
different domains of life
1201.41 they show up in.
1202.79 Because oftentimes in movies
1204.71 and even the way I'm describing it now
1206.66 it sounds as if, okay, well
somebody has to check the locks
1209.42 but they don't have to
also check the stove,
1211.22 or somebody has the need to
count to seven back and forth
1214.94 up to seven and down to seven seven times
1217.4 seven times a day or
something of that sort
1220.37 where they need symmetry in
very specific domains of life.
1223.22 But it turns out that this recurrent
1224.87 and intrusive aspect of obsessions
1227.27 leads people with OCD
1229.22 to have checking repetition
1231.95 and/or order compulsions everywhere.
1235.46 So whether or not somebody
is at work or in school
1238.13 or trying to engage in sport
1239.51 or trying to engage in relationship
1240.95 or just something simple
like walking down the street,
1243.62 the obsessions are so
intrusive that they show up
1245.93 and they compel people to
do things in that domain
1248.75 independent of whether or not
1251.15 they happen to be in
one location or another.
1253.1 In other words, the thought patterns
1255.737 and the behaviors take
over the environment
1257.93 as opposed to the environment
1259.28 driving the thought
patterns and behaviors.
1261.5 So it therefore becomes impossible
1263.15 to ever find a room that's clean enough,
1265.25 to find a bed that's made well enough,
1267.8 to find anything that's done well enough
1270.77 to remove the obsession.
1273.2 And I know I've said
it multiple times now,
1274.937 but I'm going to say it many
times throughout this episode
1278.03 in a somewhat obsessive,
but I believe justified way
1281.96 that every time that one
engages in the compulsion
1285.62 related to the obsession,
1286.82 the obsession simply becomes stronger.
1288.82 So you can imagine what a powerful
1291.35 and debilitating loop that really is.
1293.39 So let's drill a little bit deeper
1294.77 into how the obsessions and compulsions
1296.51 relate to one another.
1297.89 If we were to draw a line
between the obsessions
1299.987 and the compulsions, that
line could be described
1303.74 as anxiety.
1305.72 Now, we need to define what anxiety is
1307.88 and to be quite honest,
1309.92 most of psychology and science can't agree
1312.47 on exactly what anxiety is.
1314.12 Typically the way we think about fear
1316.25 is that it's a heightened
state of autonomic arousal,
1319.07 so increased heart rate,
increased breathing,
1320.99 sweating, et cetera, in
response to an immediate
1323.72 and present threat or perceived threat.
1326.36 Whereas anxiety, generally speaking
1328.58 in the scientific literature,
1329.99 relates to the same
sorts of thought patterns
1333.74 and somatic bodily responses, heart rate,
1336.38 breathing, et cetera,
1337.58 but without a clear and present danger
1340.73 being in the environment or right there.
1343.01 So that's the way that we're
going to talk about anxiety now.
1345.86 And anxiety is really
what binds the obsessions
1348.62 and compulsions such
that someone will have
1350.48 an intrusive thought.
1351.71 So for instance, someone
will have the thought that
1354.2 if they turn left on any street,
1356.93 that something bad will happen.
1358.61 Okay, that's an obsession.
1359.54 It's actually not all that uncommon.
1361.43 Now, how bad and what the specificity
1363.59 of that bad thing really is will vary.
1365.42 Some people will think, if I turn left,
1367.43 something generally bad will happen,
1368.84 it just makes me feel anxious,
1370.19 So they always insist on going right.
1372.11 Whereas other people will
think if I turn left,
1375.23 so and so will die, or I will die,
1378.2 or something terrible will happen,
1380.45 I'll get a disease or someone
else will get a disease
1382.67 or I'll be cursing myself or somebody else
1384.65 in some very specific way.
1386.63 This is unfortunately quite
common in people with OCD.
1390.86 So they have this feeling
1393.56 and the feeling can be generally
1394.97 or specifically related
to a particular outcome.
1397.22 But beneath that is a feeling of anxiety,
1400.07 a quickening of the heartbeat,
1402.08 a quickening of breathing,
1403.55 a narrowing of one's visual focus.
1406.31 I've talked about this
before in another podcast,
1408.11 the Master Stress, another podcast
1409.76 but if you haven't heard those,
1411.44 let me just briefly describe
1412.58 that when we are in a state of increased
1414.65 so-called autonomic arousal, alertness,
1416.48 stress, et cetera,
1418.19 our visual field literally narrows,
1420.44 the aperture of our
visual field gets smaller
1422.96 and that's because of the relationship
1424.22 between the autonomic nervous system
1425.6 and your visual system, so
you start seeing the world
1428.66 through sort of soda straw view
1430.67 or through binocular-like view,
1432.08 as opposed to seeing the big picture.
1433.61 Why is that important?
1434.63 Well, it literally sharpens
and narrows your focus
1438.8 toward the very thing that the obsessions
1440.81 and the compulsions are focused on.
1442.1 So the person walking
down the street who sees
1444.23 the opportunity to go left or right
1446.24 will only see the bad decision,
1449.66 their visual field narrows very tightly
1452.54 along that possibility
of taking a left turn.
1455.21 And I know as I describe this
seems totally irrational,
1457.64 but I want to emphasize
that the person with OCD
1460.46 knows it's irrational.
1462.44 They might feel crazy because
they're having these thoughts,
1465.89 but they know it makes no sense whatsoever
1467.99 that left somehow would
be different than right
1470.87 in terms of outcomes in
this particular case,
1473.27 and yet it feels as if it would.
1476.09 In fact, in some cases it
feels as if they went left,
1478.49 they would have a full blown panic attack.
1480.83 So the idea here is that the
obsessions and compulsions
1484.01 are bound by anxiety, but then by taking
1487.19 a right-hand turn, again, in
this one particular example,
1490.43 by taking a right-hand
turn, there's a very brief,
1493.91 I should mention, very
brief relief of that anxiety
1497.69 at the time of the decision
to go right, not left
1501.59 and there's an additional drop in anxiety
1505.1 while one takes the right-hand turn
1507.38 as opposed to the left-hand turn.
1509.63 And then as I alluded to before,
1511.7 there's a reinforcement of the compulsion.
1514.31 In other words, by going right,
1516.14 it doesn't create a situation in the brain
1518.96 and psychology of the person
that, oh, you know what,
1521.9 I'm not anxious anymore, left
would've probably been okay.
1525.11 It reinforces the idea that
right made me feel better,
1528.47 or turning right made me feel better,
1530.27 and going left would've
been that much worse.
1532.7 Again, it reinforces the
obsession even further.
1535.7 And again, we could swap out
right turns and left turns
1540.23 with something like hand washing,
1541.91 the feeling that something is contaminated
1544.31 and the need to wash one's hands
1545.78 even though one already washed their hands
1548.06 20, 30, 50 times prior.
1550.16 And we're actually going
to go back to that example
1551.63 a little bit later when we talk about
1553.64 one particular category of therapies
1555.53 that are very effective
in many people for OCD
1558.62 which are the cognitive
behavioral and exposure therapies.
1561.68 I think some of you have heard
1562.88 of cognitive behavioral
and exposure therapies,
1564.95 but the way they're used to treat OCD
1567.11 is very much different
than the way they're used
1569.63 to treat other sorts of anxiety disorders
1572.39 and other sorts of disorders generally.
1574.7 So it's fair to say that up
to 70% of people with OCD
1579.23 have some sort of anxiety
or elevated anxiety,
1582.92 either directly related to the OCD
1585.17 or indirectly related to the OCD
1586.88 and it's really hard to tease those apart
1588.53 because OCD can create its own anxiety,
1591.68 as I mentioned before, it can
even increase its own anxiety.
1594.74 And there's also an issue of depression.
1597.71 Having OCD can be very depressing,
1600.5 especially if some of these
OCD thoughts and behaviors
1603.59 start to really impede people's ability
1605.3 to function in life.
1606.23 At work, and school, and relationship,
1607.76 they can start feeling
less optimistic about life.
1609.83 And in fact, some people can
become suicidally depressed.
1612.59 That's how bad OCD can be for us.
1615.38 So we have to be careful when saying
1617.66 that 70% of people with
OCD also have anxiety
1620.57 or X number of people with
OCD are also depressed
1622.85 because we don't know whether or not
1624.17 the depression led the OCD
or the other way around
1626.75 or whether or not they're operating,
1627.89 as we say in science, in parallel.
1629.84 Some of the drug treatments
for OCD and depression
1631.88 and anxiety can tease some of that apart
1634.34 and we'll talk about that,
1635.63 but I think it's fair to say that
1637.13 what binds the obsessions
and compulsions is anxiety,
1641.0 that there's a feeling of,
1642.82 or I should say an
urgent feeling of a need
1645.08 to get rid of the obsession.
1647.21 And the person feels as if the only way
1649.19 they can do that is to engage
1650.63 in a particular compulsive behavior.
1652.4 Some people are probably wondering
1653.75 if there's a genetic component to OCD
1656.33 and indeed there is,
1657.98 although the nature of
it isn't exactly clear.
1660.56 And oftentimes when
people hear that something
1663.17 has a genetic component,
1664.61 they think it's always directly
inherited from a parent,
1668.21 and that's not always the case.
1669.68 There can be genes that
surface in siblings
1672.74 or genes that surface in children
1674.51 that are not readily apparent
1676.58 in terms of what we call a phenotype.
1678.08 So you have a genotype, the gene,
1679.34 and then you have a
phenotype, the way it shows up
1681.47 as a body form or like eye color
1684.23 or how it shows up in terms of a behavior
1686.87 or behavioral pattern.
1688.88 Based on twin studies where researchers
1691.82 have examined identical
twins, fraternal twins,
1694.43 even identical twins that
share the same sack in utero,
1697.88 the what we call monochorionic,
1699.68 so sitting in the same
little bag during pregnancy
1702.29 or in different little bags,
1703.76 you can see different levels
1704.84 of what's called genetic concordance.
1706.76 But if we were to just
sort of cut a broad swath
1709.4 through all of the genetic data,
1711.14 it's fair to say that about
40 to 50% of OCD cases
1715.34 have some genetic component,
1716.78 some mutation or some
inherited aspect that's genetic
1720.23 and that one could point to
1721.07 if they got their genome mapped.
1723.2 Now, while that's interesting,
1724.31 I don't think it's terribly
useful for most people.
1726.59 First of all, you can't
really control your genes,
1728.96 at least at this point in history,
1730.76 even though there are things
like epigenetic control
1733.22 and people are very
excited about technologies
1735.11 like CRISPR for modifying the genome
1738.11 in humans at some point,
1740.51 most people can't control
their genetics, right?
1742.64 You can't pick who your
parents were as they say.
1744.77 So just know that there
is a genetic component
1747.17 in about half of people
with OCD, but not always.
1750.83 Now as is typical for this podcast,
1753.29 I want to focus on some
of the neural mechanisms
1755.96 and chemical systems in the brain and body
1758.15 that generate
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
1760.76 In fact, if you've watched
this podcast before,
1763.07 listen to this podcast before,
1764.6 this is always how I structure things.
1766.31 First, we introduce a topic
1768.56 and we explore that topic in detail
1770.39 and really define what
it is and what it isn't.
1772.61 And then it's very
important that we focus on
1775.19 what is known and what is not known
1776.99 about the biological
mechanisms that generate
1780.17 whatever that thing happens
to be, in this case,
1781.76 OCD and obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.
1784.247 Now I want to emphasize
that even if you don't have
1786.98 a background in biology,
1788.78 I will make this information
accessible to you.
1790.76 And I also want to emphasize
that for those of you
1792.86 that are interested in treatments
1794.45 and are anxiously awaiting
the description of things
1798.35 that can help with OCD, I encourage you,
1802.04 if you will, to please try and digest
1804.65 some of the material about
the underlying mechanisms
1806.66 because understanding
even just a little bit
1808.76 of those biological
mechanisms can really help
1811.25 shed light on why particular drug
1813.98 and behavioral treatments
1815.087 and other sorts of treatments
work and don't work.
1818.12 This is especially
important in the case of OCD
1820.97 where it turns out that the order
1822.68 and type of treatment can really vary
1824.48 according to individual,
1826.04 and that's something really
special and important about OCD
1829.01 that we really can't say
for a number of the other
1831.2 sorts of disorders that we've described
1832.76 on previous podcasts.
1834.35 So let's take a step back
1835.7 and look at the neural circuitry.
1837.68 What's going on in the brain
and body of people with OCD?
1840.8 Why the intrusive recurrent thoughts?
1843.41 Why the compulsions?
1844.43 Why is that whole system bound by anxiety?
1848.39 And in some ways in thinking about that,
1850.46 I want you to keep in mind
1851.84 that the brain has two main functions.
1856.46 The brain's main functions are
1858.8 to take care of all
the housekeeping stuff,
1860.9 make sure digestion works,
1862.04 make sure the heart beats,
1863.03 make sure you keep
breathing no matter what,
1865.19 make sure that you can see, you can hear,
1868.22 you can smell, et cetera,
1869.45 the basic stuff, and then
there's an enormous amount
1872.18 of brain real estate that's designed
1874.49 to allow you to predict
what's going to happen next,
1876.95 either in the immediate future
1877.92 or in the long-term future.
1880.1 And largely that's done based
on your knowledge of the past.
1883.03 So you also have memory systems.
1884.48 And of course you have
systems in the brain and body
1887.0 that are designed to bind what's happening
1889.79 at the housekeeping level,
like your heart rate,
1891.86 to your anticipation of
what's going to happen next.
1894.35 So if you're thinking about
something very fearful,
1896.09 your body will have one type of reaction.
1897.65 If you're thinking about
something very pleasant
1899.3 and relaxing, your body will
have another type of reaction.
1901.91 So whenever I hear about
the brain-body distinction,
1904.94 I have to just remind everybody
1907.01 that there really is no distinction
1908.42 between brain and body
when you think about it
1910.52 through the nervous system.
1911.48 The nervous system is the brain,
the eyes, the spinal cord,
1914.03 but of course all their connections
1915.41 with all the organs of the body
1916.55 and the connections of
all the organs of the body
1918.26 with the brain, the
spinal cord, et cetera.
1920.33 So as I describe these neural circuits,
1922.88 I don't want you to think of them
1923.87 as just things happening in the head,
1925.76 they are certainly happening in the head,
1927.8 in fact, the circuits all
described most in detail
1930.71 do exist within the confines
of your cranial vault,
1933.29 that's nerd speak for skull,
1935.03 but those circuits are
driving particular predictions
1939.17 and therefore particular biases
1941.42 towards particular actions in your body.
1943.49 They're creating a state of readiness
1945.02 or a state of desire to
check or desire to count
1948.71 or desire to avoid et cetera, et cetera.
1952.1 So what are these circuits?
1953.45 Well, there's been a lot
of wonderful research
1956.48 exploring the neural circuit's underlying
1958.76 obsessive-compulsive disorder
1960.8 and that's mainly been accomplished
1961.94 through a couple of methods.
1963.5 Most of those methods
when applied in humans
1965.99 involve getting some look
into which brain areas
1970.7 are active when people
are having obsessions
1973.07 and when people are
engaging in compulsions.
1975.77 Now that might seem simple to do,
1977.39 but of course your brain is
housed inside the cranial vault.
1980.51 And in order to look inside it,
1981.8 you have to use things like
magnetic resonance imaging,
1984.11 which is just fancy technology
for looking at blood flow,
1987.53 which relates to activation
of neurons, nerve cells,
1991.04 or things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,
1994.04 which has nothing to do with the verb pet
1995.69 and has nothing to do with your house pet,
1997.61 has everything to do with
positron emission tomography,
2000.46 which is just another way of seeing
2002.14 which brain areas are active
2003.52 and then you can also
use PET to figure out
2005.44 what sorts of neurochemicals are active,
2007.18 like dopamine, et cetera.
2009.22 Many studies, we can fairly say dozens
2012.64 if not hundreds of studies,
2013.81 have now identified a particular circuit
2016.63 or loop of brain areas
that are interconnected
2019.48 and very active in
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
2024.52 That loop includes the cortex,
2027.37 which is kind of the outer
shell of the human brain.
2030.91 The lumpy stuff, as
it's sometimes appears,
2033.73 if the skull is removed.
2035.2 And it involves an area
called the striatum
2037.51 which is involved in action selection
2039.22 and holding back action.
2040.87 The striatum is involved
in what's commonly called
2043.18 go and no-go types of behaviors.
2045.46 So every type of behavior
like picking up a pen
2047.32 or a mug of coffee involves
a go type function.
2051.43 It involves generating an action.
2053.53 But every time I resist an action,
2056.14 my nervous system is also doing that
2057.73 using this brain structure, the striatum,
2060.88 which includes, among other
things, the basal ganglia.
2064.06 We've talked about that before.
2065.17 I'm not trying to overload
you with terminology here,
2067.18 but I know some people are
interested in terminology.
2069.52 So you have go behaviors
and you have no-go,
2071.47 resisting of behaviors,
not going toward behavior.
2075.76 The cortex and the striatum
are in this intricate
2079.03 back and forth talk.
2079.99 It's really loops of connections.
2081.37 The cortex doesn't tell
the striatum what to do,
2083.11 the striatum doesn't tell
the cortex what to do.
2085.09 They're in a crosstalk.
2085.99 Like any good relationship, there's a lot
2087.43 of back and forth communication.
2089.89 There's a third element in
this cortico-striatal loop
2093.7 as it's called, and that's the thalamus.
2096.07 Now, the thalamus is not a structure
2097.45 I've talked a lot about
before on this podcast,
2099.61 but it's one of my favorite
structures to think about
2102.04 and teach about in neuroanatomy,
2103.63 which I teach back at Stanford
2105.52 and I've taught for many years elsewhere
2107.47 because the thalamus is this incredible
2109.54 egg-like structure in
the center of your brain
2112.36 that has different channels through it.
2114.52 Channels for relaying visual information
2117.4 or auditory information
or touch information
2120.55 from your environment up into your cortex,
2123.97 and as a consequence,
making certain things
2126.16 that are happening to you and around you
2128.62 apparent to you, making you aware of them,
2130.6 making you perceive them
and suppressing others.
2134.44 So for instance, right now,
2135.58 if you're hearing me say this,
2137.17 your thalamus has what are
called auditory nuclei,
2140.44 there's collections of neurons
2141.85 that respond to sound waves
2144.97 that are of course coming
in through your ears,
2146.98 and your thalamus is active in a way
2149.713 that those particular
regions of your thalamus
2152.32 are allowed, literally permitted
to pass the information
2155.98 coming from your ears
through some other steps
2158.62 but then to your thalamus,
your auditory thalamus,
2160.63 then up to your cortex and you can hear
2162.19 what I'm saying right now.
2163.9 At the same time, your
thalamus is surrounded
2166.84 by a kind of a shell,
2167.92 something called the
thalamic reticular nucleus.
2169.99 Again, you don't have
to remember the names,
2171.43 but this thalamic reticular nucleus,
2173.2 also sometimes called the
reticular thalamic nucleus,
2175.75 this is, believe it or not, a
subject of debate in science.
2178.24 There are people that
literally hated each other,
2179.92 probably still hate each other,
2180.88 even though one of them
is dead for decades,
2182.92 because they would argue it
was thalamic reticular nucleus,
2184.93 the other was reticular thalamic nucleus.
2187.21 Anyway, these are scientists,
2188.62 they're people, they tend to debate.
2191.05 but the thalamic reticular nucleus,
2192.58 as I'm going to call it,
2194.38 serves as a sort of gate
2196.33 as to which information
is allowed to pass through
2198.79 up to your conscious
experience, and which is not.
2201.85 And that gating mechanism
is strongly regulated
2204.19 by the chemical GABA.
2205.93 GABA is a neurotransmitter
that is inhibitory, as we say,
2210.46 it serves to shut down
or suppress the activity
2213.73 of other neurons.
2215.02 So the thalamic reticular
nucleus is really saying,
2218.65 no, touch information
cannot come in right now.
2222.19 You should not be
thinking about the contact
2224.86 of the back of your legs with the chair
2226.96 that you're sitting on, Andrew,
2227.89 you should be thinking about
what you're trying to say
2229.54 and what you're hearing
and how your voice sounds
2231.22 and what you see in
front of you, et cetera.
2233.92 Whereas if I'm about to get
an injection from a doctor
2237.31 or I'm in pain, or I'm in pleasure,
2239.56 I'm going to think about
my somatic sensation
2242.23 at the level of touch
2243.49 and I'm probably going to think less
2244.99 about smells in the room,
2246.76 although I might also think
about smells in the room
2248.59 or what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing.
2250.36 We can combine all these
different sensory modalities,
2253.36 but the thalamic reticular nucleus
2254.95 really allows us to funnel,
2256.99 to direct particular categories
of sensory experience
2260.08 into our conscious awareness
2261.43 and suppress other categories
of sensory experience.
2265.66 In addition, the thalamic
reticular nucleus
2268.33 plays a critical role in which thoughts
2272.02 are allowed to pass up to
our conscious perception
2274.84 and which ones are not,
2276.73 so much so that some neuroscientists
2279.4 and indeed some neurophilosophers,
2281.53 if you want call them that,
2282.67 have theorized or philosophized that
2285.85 the thalamic reticular nucleus
2287.17 is actually involved in our consciousness.
2289.36 Now, consciousness isn't a topic
2290.71 that I really want to
talk about this episode
2292.33 and it's a very kind of mushy-murky,
2294.67 as we say in science, it's a shmooey term
2297.16 because it doesn't really
have clear definitions
2298.93 so arguments about it often get lost
2300.67 in the fact that people are
arguing about different things.
2303.01 But when I say consciousness,
2304.45 what I mean is conscious awareness.
2306.28 So let's zoom out and
take a look at the circuit
2308.8 that we've got and that we now know
2310.45 based on neuroimaging studies is
2313.0 intimately involved in
generating obsessions
2315.13 and compulsions in OCD.
2316.75 We have a cortex or neocortex,
2319.24 which is involved in
perception and understanding
2321.43 of what's happening.
2322.57 We have the striatum and basal ganglia,
2324.76 which are involved in
generating behaviors, go,
2327.46 and suppressing behaviors, no-go.
2329.5 And we have the thalamus which collects
2331.9 all of our sensory experience in parallel,
2334.39 hearing, touch, smell, et cetera,
2336.58 not so much smell through the
thalamus, I should mention,
2338.41 but the other senses that is.
2340.84 And then that thalamus is encased
2344.32 by the thalamic reticular
nucleus, which serves
2346.93 as a kind of a guard
saying you can pass through
2349.21 and you can pass through,
but you, you, you
2351.16 can't pass through up to conscious
2353.29 understanding and perception.
2355.27 So that loop, this
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop,
2358.79 cortico-striatal-thalamic
loop is the circuit
2361.9 thought to underlie OCD,
2364.6 and dysfunction in that circuit
2366.4 is what's thought to underlie OCD.
2368.29 Now, again, this circuit
exists in all of us
2369.94 and it can operate in healthy ways,
2371.26 or it can operate in ways
that make us feel unhealthy
2373.45 or even suffer from full blown OCD.
2376.51 How do we know that this
circuit is involved in OCD?
2379.66 Well there, we can look to
some really interesting studies
2382.81 that involve bringing human
subjects into the laboratory
2386.71 and generating their
obsessions and compulsions
2389.02 and then imaging their brain using
2390.61 any variety of techniques
that we talked about before.
2393.7 What would such an experiment look like?
2395.23 Well, in order to do
that sort of experiment,
2397.63 first of all, you need people who have OCD
2400.72 and of course you need
control subjects that don't,
2402.91 and you need to be able to reliably evoke
2405.16 the obsessions and the compulsions.
2406.78 Now, it turns out this is
most easily, or I should say
2410.11 most simply done, 'cause it can't be easy
2411.85 for the people with OCD,
2412.9 but this is most straightforward,
2415.24 that's the word I was looking for,
2416.32 most straightforward when
looking at the category
2419.68 of obsessions and compulsions that relate
2422.23 to order and cleanliness.
2425.11 So what they do typically
is bring subjects
2427.57 into the laboratory who have a obsession
2430.45 about germs and contamination
2432.58 and a compulsion to hand wash,
2434.92 and they give these
people, believe it or not,
2437.68 a sweaty towel that contains the sweat
2441.01 and the odor and the
2443.92 liquid, basically, from
somebody else's hands.
2446.5 In fact, they'll sometimes have someone
2448.09 wipe their own sweat off
the back of their neck
2450.85 and put it on the towel
and then they'll put it
2452.74 in front of the person,
which as you can imagine
2454.66 for someone with OCD is
incredibly anxiety-provoking
2457.99 and almost always evokes
these obsessions about,
2461.353 ugh, this is really, this is really bad.
2464.41 This is really bad, I need to clean,
2466.591 I need to clean. I need to clean.
2467.424 Now they're doing all this while someone
2468.67 is in a brain scanner or
2470.56 while they're being imaged
2471.4 for positron emission tomography.
2473.35 And then they can also look at
2474.31 the patterns of activation in the brain
2477.28 while the person is doing hand washing.
2479.02 Although sometimes the apparati
2480.58 associated with these imaging studies
2481.84 make it hard to do a lot of movement,
2483.34 they can do these sorts of studies.
2485.35 They have done these sorts of studies
2487.09 in many subjects using
different variations
2490.27 of what I just described.
2491.38 And low and behold what lights up?
2494.255 And when I say lights up,
2495.25 what sorts of brain regions
2497.74 are more metabolically
active, more blood flow,
2499.69 more neural activity?
2500.53 Well, it's this particular
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop.
2504.85 In addition to that,
2506.26 some of the drug treatments
2507.76 that are effective in some,
2509.26 and I want to emphasize some individuals,
2511.48 at suppressing obsessions
and or compulsions
2514.36 such as the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors
2517.35 or SSRIs, which we'll talk
about in a little bit,
2521.23 when people take those drugs,
2522.97 they see not just a suppression of
2525.88 the obsession and compulsion,
2528.46 but also a suppression of these
particular neural circuits.
2532.33 They become less active.
2533.62 Now I want to emphasize
and telegraph a little bit
2536.2 of what's coming later,
2538.39 these drugs like SSRIs do not
work for everybody with OCD.
2542.02 And as many of you know,
2543.07 they carry other certain
problems and side effects
2545.53 for many but not all individuals.
2548.11 But nonetheless, what we have now
2549.97 is an observation that this circuit,
2551.92 the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop,
2553.72 is active in OCD.
2555.07 We have a manipulation that
when people take a drug
2558.13 that at least in those individuals
2559.54 is effective in suppressing or eliminating
2561.64 the obsessions and compulsions,
2562.84 there's less activity in this loop.
2564.88 And thanks to some very
good animal model studies,
2567.61 that at least at this point in time,
2569.2 you really couldn't do in humans,
2571.09 although soon that may change,
2573.1 we now know in a causal way
2575.14 that the equivalent circuitry
exists in other animals,
2579.85 such as mice, such as
cats, such as monkeys,
2582.19 and that activation of those particular
2585.88 cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits
2588.13 in animal models can indeed evoke OCD
2591.82 in an individual that prior to that
2594.64 did not have OCD.
2596.29 So I'm just going to
briefly describe one study.
2598.27 This is a now classic study published
2600.64 in the journal Science,
2601.69 one of the three apex journals in 2013.
2604.81 The first author on this paper
2606.67 is Susanne Ahmari, A-H-M-A-R-I.
2610.18 I will provide a link to
this in the show notes.
2612.25 It's a truly landmark paper done
2614.35 in Rene Hen's lab at Columbia University.
2617.44 And the title of the paper
2618.46 is repeated cortico-striatal
stimulation generates,
2621.43 that's the key word here,
2622.27 generates persistent OCD-like behavior.
2625.33 What they did is they took mice,
2627.07 mice do mouse things.
2629.2 They move around, they play with toys,
2630.67 they eat, they pee, they mate,
2632.59 they do various things in their cage,
2634.36 but they also groom.
2636.73 Humans groom, animals with fur groom,
2639.46 Well, you hope most people groom,
2640.87 some people over-groom,
some people under-groom,
2643.33 but most people groom.
2644.163 They'll comb their hair,
they'll clean, et cetera.
2645.91 Those are normal behaviors
that humans engage in.
2648.82 I'm not aware that mice comb their hair,
2649.9 but mice adjust their hair.
2651.13 So they'll kind of pet their hair
2652.117 and they'll do this.
2652.95 They'll sometimes even
do it to each other.
2654.67 We used to have mice in the lab,
2655.72 now we only do human studies,
2656.98 but the mice will groom themselves,
2659.86 and typical, what we call wild type mice,
2662.38 not because they're wild,
2663.25 but because they're typical,
2664.63 will groom themselves at
a particular frequency,
2667.69 but not to the point where
their hair is falling out.
2670.06 Not constantly, they are
grooming some of the time
2673.15 and they're doing other mouse
things other mouse times.
2676.72 So in this particular study,
2678.1 what they did is they
used some technology,
2681.04 which it actually was discussed
2682.66 on a previous episode of
The Huberman Lab Podcast,
2685.0 this is technology that was
developed by a psychiatrist
2687.4 and bioengineer by the
name of Karl Deisseroth,
2689.32 one of my colleagues at
Stanford School of Medicine.
2692.32 This is technology that allows researchers
2694.27 to use the presentation of light
2696.88 to control neural activity
in particular brain areas
2700.78 in a very high fidelity way.
2703.21 You control the activity in
the cortex of the striatum
2705.48 or the thalamus when you
want and how you want.
2707.83 It's really a beautiful technology.
2709.66 In any event, what they
did in this study is,
2711.9 or I should say what Susan Ahmari
2713.68 and colleagues did in this study
2715.24 was to stimulate the
cortico-striatal circuitry
2720.28 in animals that did not
have any OCD-like behavior.
2722.95 And when they did that,
2724.21 those animals started grooming incessantly
2726.46 to the point where their hair
was falling out or they even,
2729.43 they didn't take the experiments
this far, fortunately,
2731.35 but the animals would have a tendency
2732.88 to almost rub themselves raw
2734.59 in the same way that
somebody who has a compulsion
2737.05 to hand wash would, sadly,
people will hand wash
2740.26 to the point where their hands
2741.093 are actually bleeding and raw.
2742.51 It's really that bad.
2743.59 I know that's tough imagery to imagine,
2745.6 and you can't even imagine
why someone would self harm
2747.49 in that way, but again,
that's that incredible anxiety
2751.09 relationship between the
compulsion, excuse me,
2753.07 the obsession and the compulsion,
2754.93 and the fact that
engaging in the compulsion
2757.6 simply strengthens the obsession
2759.19 and therefore the anxiety.
2760.6 So that collection of studies, of data,
2764.59 FMRI, PET scanning in humans,
2766.81 the treatment with SSRIs,
and these experiments where
2771.37 researchers have actively triggered
2774.46 these particular circuits in animal models
2777.25 that previously did not have
2778.78 too much activity in these circuits
2780.07 and then they observe OCD emerging
2783.37 really points squarely to the fact
2785.14 that the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop
2787.48 is likely to be the basis of OCD.
2790.36 Now, of course, other circuits
could also be involved,
2792.94 but the cortico-striatal-thalamic circuit
2795.49 seems to be the main circuit
generating OCD-like behavior.
2799.36 That's a lot of mechanism.
2800.74 Hopefully it was described in a way
2802.6 that you can digest and understand.
2804.46 And some of you might be
thinking, well, so what?
2806.29 Why does that help me?
2807.25 I mean, I can't reach into my brain
2808.78 and turn off my cortex.
2810.1 I can't reach into my brain
and turn off my thalamus.
2812.65 And indeed, on the one hand, that's true.
2815.5 But as you'll next learn
2817.48 when thinking about the
various behavioral treatments
2819.79 and drug treatments
2821.2 and holistic treatments for OCD,
2823.57 what you'll notice is that each one taps
2825.49 into a different component
2826.84 of this cortico-striatal-thalamic loop.
2829.78 And by understanding
that, you can start to see
2832.69 why certain treatments
might work at one stage
2835.27 of the illness versus others.
2837.31 You will also start to understand why
2839.32 obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
2842.38 does not have the same
sorts of engagements
2844.75 of these neural loops,
2845.83 and yet relies on other
aspects of brain and body
2850.3 and therefore responds best
to other sorts of treatments.
2853.75 Or in some cases, people
with obsessive-compulsive
2856.93 personality disorder are
not even seeking treatment
2858.97 as I alluded to before.
2860.35 The point here is that by understanding
2861.79 the underlying mechanism
2863.23 why certain drugs and
behavioral treatments work
2865.99 and don't work will become
immediately apparent
2868.15 and in thinking about
that, in knowing that,
2871.42 you'll be able to make excellent choices,
2873.46 I believe, in terms of what
sorts of treatments you pursue,
2876.22 what sorts of treatments you abandon,
2877.9 and most importantly, the order,
2880.75 the sequence that you pursue
and apply those treatments.
2884.02 Before we go any further,
I'd like to give people
2886.39 a little bit of a window into
2887.89 what a diagnosis for OCD would look like.
2890.89 Give you a sense of the sorts of questions
2893.11 that a clinician would ask to determine
2895.6 whether or not somebody has OCD or not.
2898.12 Now, I want to be clear,
I'm not going to do this
2899.5 in an exhaustive way.
2900.67 I wouldn't want anyone to self-diagnose.
2902.59 Although I'm hoping that
by sharing some of this,
2904.69 that some of you might get insight
2906.04 into whether or not you do have obsessions
2907.96 and compulsions that
might qualify for OCD,
2910.9 and perhaps even to seek out help.
2913.3 The most commonly used test of OCD,
2917.86 or for OCD, I should say,
2918.91 is called the Yale-Brown
Obsessive Compulsive Scale.
2922.0 And this is, scientists love acronyms
2924.58 as do the military, and it's the Y-BOCS,
2926.857 the Y-B-O-C-S, the Y-BOCS.
2931.36 So typically someone
will go into the clinic
2933.7 either because a family
member encouraged them to
2935.77 or because they feel
that they're suffering
2937.66 from obsessions and compulsions,
2939.49 and before the clinician would proceed
2942.46 with any kind of direct questions,
2944.02 they would very clearly define
2945.55 what obsessions and compulsions are.
2946.93 And here I'm actually
reading from the Y-BOCS.
2949.21 So quote, "obsessions are
unwelcome and distressing ideas,
2951.7 thoughts, images or impulses
2953.11 that repeatedly enter your mind.
2954.46 They may seem to occur against your will.
2956.59 They may be repugnant to you,
2957.88 you may recognize them as senseless
2959.53 and they may not fit your personality."
2962.38 Then there are compulsions.
2963.79 Quote, "Compulsions, on the other hand,
2965.56 are behaviors or acts that
you feel driven to perform
2967.72 although you may recognize
them as senseless or excessive.
2971.02 At times, you may try to resist doing them
2972.91 but this may prove difficult.
2974.26 You may experience anxiety
that does not diminish
2976.72 until the behavior is completed."
2978.43 And as I mentioned before in many cases,
2980.68 immediately after the
behavior has completed,
2982.33 the anxiety doesn't just return,
it indeed can strengthen.
2985.63 Now, there are a tremendous
number of questions
2986.89 on the Y-BOCS.
2987.723 So I'm just going to highlight
2989.68 a few of the general categories.
2992.2 Typically, the person
will fill out a checklist,
2994.78 so they will designate whether or not
2997.6 currently or in the past they have,
2999.79 for instance, aggressive obsessions,
3002.19 fear that one might harm themselves,
3004.2 fear that one might harm others,
3005.91 fear that they'll steal things,
3007.08 fear that they will act
on unwanted impulses,
3009.93 currently or in the past or both,
3012.06 that's one category.
3013.11 The other one are
contamination obsessions.
3014.88 So concern with dirt or germs,
3016.53 bothered by sticky substances or residues,
3018.54 et cetera, et cetera.
3019.59 So there are a bunch
of different categories
3021.51 that include, for instance,
sexual obsessions,
3024.33 what are called saving obsessions,
3026.49 even moral obsessions,
3028.47 excess concern with right
or wrong or morality,
3030.87 concerned with sacrilege and blasphemy,
3033.93 obsession with need for
symmetry and exactness.
3035.82 Again, all of these
questions being answered
3037.74 as either present in the past
3039.45 or not present in the past,
3041.01 present currently or
not present currently.
3043.17 And then the test generally
3046.29 transitions over to questions
about target symptoms.
3049.86 They really try and get people to identify
3052.05 if they have obsessions, what
are their exact obsessions?
3054.63 Now, this turns out to be really important
3056.19 because as we talk about some
3057.32 of the therapies that really work,
3059.88 I'll just give away a little bit
3061.26 of why they work best in certain cases
3064.08 and why they don't work
as well in other cases,
3066.81 it turns out that it
becomes very important
3069.39 for the clinician and the patient
3071.34 to not just identify the obsessions
3073.647 and the compulsions generally
3075.243 in a kind of a generic or top contour way,
3078.03 but to really encourage
or even force the patient
3081.24 to define very precisely what the biggest,
3085.11 most catastrophic fear is,
3087.51 what the obsession really relates to.
3089.76 That turns out to be very important
3091.41 in disrupting this
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop
3094.47 and getting relief from symptoms
3096.36 one way or the other.
3097.65 So the Yale-Brown Obsessive
Compulsive Scale, this Y-BOCS,
3101.13 again, is very extensive,
3102.42 it goes on for dozens of pages actually,
3105.69 and has all these different categories,
3108.0 not so much designed to just pinpoint
3110.79 what people obsess about
3112.29 or what they feel compelled to do,
3114.81 but to also try and identify
3116.91 what is the fear that's driving all this.
3119.97 In the way that we've
set this up thus far,
3122.16 we've been talking about
obsessions and compulsions
3124.02 is kind of existing in a vacuum.
3125.91 You're obsessed about germs
3127.26 and you're compelled to wash your hands,
3129.18 obsessed about germs,
compelled to wash your hands.
3130.83 Or obsessed about symmetry,
3132.24 compelled to put right
angles on everything.
3134.22 Or obsessed about counting
3135.51 and therefore counting, et cetera.
3137.37 But beneath that
3139.65 is a cognitive component
that is not at all apparent
3143.28 from someone describing their obsession
3146.31 and from someone describing or
displaying their compulsion.
3149.55 The deeper layer to all
that is what is the fear,
3153.24 exactly, if one were to
not perform the compulsion,
3157.8 meaning what is the fear
that's driving the obsession?
3161.1 So that brings us to a
very powerful category
3164.34 of treatments that I
should say does not work
3167.73 in everybody with OCD
3169.44 but works in many people with OCD
3172.02 and really speaks to the
underlying neural circuitry
3176.31 that generates OCD and
how to interrupt it.
3178.71 And that is the treatment
3179.88 of cognitive behavioral therapy
3182.22 and in particular,
3183.06 exposure-based cognitive
behavioral therapy.
3186.63 So we're going to talk about
cognitive behavioral therapy
3188.46 and exposure therapy now,
3190.05 but right at the outset,
3191.85 I want to distinguish the kinds
3193.23 of cognitive behavioral therapy
3194.4 and exposure therapies that are done
3195.81 for obsessive-compulsive disorder,
3197.187 for the sorts of cognitive
behavioral therapies
3199.05 that are done for other types
3200.91 of mental challenges and disorders
3204.3 because cognitive
behavioral therapy for OCD
3207.51 really has everything to do
3208.92 with identifying the utmost fear.
3212.91 In some sense, we can think of fears
3214.11 as kind of along a hierarchy.
3215.88 An the example earlier of somebody
3217.95 being afraid to turn left and therefore
3219.84 feeling compelled to turn right,
3221.85 you would want to take that person
3223.17 and really understand
what do they fear most
3226.5 about turning left?
3227.46 Now they might not be aware of it.
3229.02 They might not be conscious
to what that really is,
3231.39 but if you were to probe
them in a clinical setting,
3233.7 you would eventually get to an answer.
3235.11 That answer could be at first,
3237.66 I don't know, just, it's just bad.
3239.31 I don't know why it's
bad, it makes no sense,
3241.26 but it's just bad.
3242.28 I do not want to go left.
3243.42 I don't know why, I don't know why.
3244.83 But if you were to push
that person a little bit
3247.08 in a respectful and kind and caring way
3250.32 aimed at their treatment,
3251.16 if you were to push 'em and say,
3251.993 well, what do you mean by bad?
3253.65 If you turn left, you
think the world would end?
3256.2 They might say, no, the
world's not going to end,
3257.85 but you know, someone is
going to die suddenly.
3260.97 I know that sounds crazy, but
somebody's going to die suddenly.
3264.12 This almost sounds like superstition,
3265.74 we'll talk about superstitions later,
3267.03 but indeed it is somewhat superstitious.
3269.37 So for instance, you would
say, who's going to die?
3272.07 And they'd say, I don't know.
3273.66 And you'd say, no, really
who's going to die?
3275.85 If you think about this,
are you going to die?
3277.44 Is so and so going to die?
3278.46 And very often,
3280.56 very often what you find is that
3283.05 people will start to
3285.45 reveal the underlying obsession
3288.63 at a level of detail that
both to the clinician
3291.63 and to them can be somewhat astonishing
3293.37 even though they've been
living with that detail
3295.17 in their mind for a very long time.
3297.24 Now, how could somebody
start to reveal detail
3299.19 about something that's
existed in their mind
3300.81 for a very long time, but
not known about it, right?
3304.23 Not been aware of it.
3305.46 Now, some of you might think,
3306.36 oh, it's repressed or something.
3308.01 That's not at all what's happening.
3310.35 If you think about the
architecture of OCD,
3312.63 typically, people will have an obsession
3314.46 and then they'll engage in the compulsion
3316.14 as quickly as they can to
relieve that obsession.
3318.66 So in many ways, the disease itself
3320.4 prevents people from ever
getting to the bottom
3323.43 of that trough, ever getting to the point
3325.5 where they really clearly
articulate to themselves
3327.99 exactly what it is that they fear.
3330.57 But it becomes so essential to articulate
3333.45 exactly what it is that they fear
3335.91 for a somewhat counterintuitive reason.
3337.83 You might think, oh,
the moment they realize
3340.08 exactly what they fear, everything lifts,
3342.51 the circuit turns off
and they just feel better
3344.4 because they realized it.
3345.87 I wish I could tell you that's the case,
3347.1 but it turns out it's the opposite.
3348.84 What the clinician is
actually trying to do
3351.18 is get people to feel
more anxiety, not less.
3355.2 What they're trying to get them to do
3356.34 is to short circuit, no pun intended,
3359.4 to intervene in their own neural circuit,
3361.65 I should say, with that relief of anxiety,
3366.0 however brief, brought on by engaging
3368.67 in the compulsion
related to the obsession.
3370.74 So, whereas typically someone would feel
3373.8 the obsession with, ugh,
I don't want to turn left
3375.797 'cause something bad's going to happen,
3377.34 someone's going to die,
and then they turn right,
3379.74 they never get the
option or the opportunity
3382.68 to really explore what would happen
3385.56 were they to turn left or to
not be able to turn right.
3388.56 By forcing them down the path of inquiry,
3391.02 that leads them to the place
where they very clearly
3393.99 identify the fear, the anxiety,
3397.2 it raises the anxiety in them,
3399.54 and that's actually what
the clinician is after.
3403.71 Cognitive behavioral
therapy and exposure therapy
3407.1 in the context of OCD, most often involves
3410.1 trying to get people to tolerate,
3412.71 not relieve their anxiety.
3414.93 This is extremely important.
3416.34 And I realize there's variation to this
3418.62 depending on the style of
cognitive behavioral therapy,
3421.62 the style of exposure therapy,
but almost across the board,
3425.52 The goal, again, is to get
people to feel the anxiety
3429.54 that normally they are able
to at least partially relieve,
3432.87 however briefly, by
engaging in the compulsion.
3435.87 So if we think back to that circuit
3438.18 of cortico-striatal-thalamic,
what's going on here?
3441.15 Where is CBT intervening?
3443.46 What part of the circuit
is getting interrupted?
3446.37 Well, as you recall,
3447.203 the cortex is involved
in conscious perception.
3449.4 The thalamus and that
thalamic reticular nucleus
3451.62 are involved in the
passage of certain types
3454.86 of experience up to our
conscious perception, not others.
3458.1 And the striatum is involved
3459.21 in this go, no-go type behavior.
3462.45 When OCD is really expressing
itself in its fullness,
3467.25 people feel an anxiety
around a particular thought
3470.16 and they either have a go,
3473.22 for instance, wash hands,
3474.66 or a no-go, do not turn
left type reaction.
3479.79 By having people progressively,
3481.65 in a kind of hierarchical way,
3483.6 reveal their precise source of anxiety,
3486.6 their utmost fear in this context,
3489.63 what happens is they feel enormous amounts
3492.09 of autonomic arousal.
3493.83 Now in the context of anxiety treatment
3496.41 or other types of treatments,
3497.7 the goal would be to
teach people to dampen,
3499.77 to lessen their anxiety
through breathing techniques
3502.38 or through visualization techniques
3504.78 or through self-talk or
through social support,
3507.24 any of the number of
things that are well-known
3508.95 to help people self
regulate their own anxiety.
3511.44 Here, it's the opposite.
3512.88 What they're trying to
get the patient to do
3515.1 is to really feel the
anxiety at its maximum,
3518.31 but then do the exact opposite
3520.14 of whatever the normal compulsion is.
3521.82 So if normally the compulsion
is to wash one's hands,
3524.31 then the idea is to suppress hand washing
3526.68 while being in the experience
of the utmost anxiety.
3529.83 Or in the case of not turning left,
3532.74 the person is expected to
3535.29 or would hopefully be able
to actually turn left,
3541.407 and as you can imagine, that
would evoke tremendous anxiety
3544.05 and yet to tolerate that anxiety.
3546.12 Now I want to be very clear,
3546.99 this is not the sort of thing
you want to do on your own.
3548.97 This is not the sort of thing
you want to do for a friend.
3550.86 This is done by trained
licensed psychologists
3554.46 and psychiatrists.
3555.96 But nonetheless, it
really points to the fact
3559.23 that as a anxiety-related disorder,
3562.53 OCD is distinct from
other types of anxiety
3565.65 and anxiety-related disorders,
3567.63 things like PTSD and
panic disorder, et cetera,
3570.42 because the goal again
is to bring the person
3572.97 right up close to the thing
that they fear the most
3576.42 and then to interrupt the circuit.
3578.64 And now you should be able to know,
3581.46 just intuitively, 'cause you
understand the mechanisms,
3584.58 that the circuit you're trying to disrupt
3586.26 is the pattern of information flow
3589.35 from the thinking part of the brain,
3591.0 the perception part of the brain,
3592.02 which is the cortex, to the striatum.
3595.23 The striatum has these
neurons which are active
3598.56 that essentially are, I
know it sounds a little bit
3600.69 like a discussion about free will,
3602.07 but they're trying to get some,
3603.12 the person to generate a certain behavior,
3604.95 suppress a certain behavior.
3606.81 And as anxiety ramps up,
3608.31 it's sort of a hydraulic
pressure to do that very thing
3611.73 that they've done for so long
3612.81 and they suffer from so much.
3614.64 We talked about hydraulic
pressure in the context
3616.65 of aggression in the aggression episode,
3618.78 this is very similar.
3620.79 There's a kind of a,
3622.29 now when I say hydraulic pressure,
3623.49 it's not actual hydraulic pressure,
3624.9 it's the confluence of a
lot of different systems.
3626.94 It's neurochemicals, we'll soon learn,
3628.62 it's hormonal, it's electrical,
3630.51 it's a lot of different
things operating in parallel
3632.88 so we can't point to one
chemical or transmitter.
3635.46 What's happening is the
person is feeling compelled
3637.44 to act, act, act to relieve the anxiety
3639.66 and through a progressive
type of exposure,
3643.44 you don't throw people in the deep end
3645.03 in this kind of therapy right off the bat,
3647.52 you gradually ratchet them toward
3649.23 or move them toward the discussion
3650.91 of exactly what they fear the most
3652.44 and then eventually move them toward
3654.09 the interruption of the compulsion
3656.25 as they're feeling this
extremely elevated anxiety,
3658.77 of course, within the context
3659.94 of a supportive clinical setting.
3662.61 But in doing that, what
you are teaching people
3665.34 is that the anxiety can
exist without the need
3668.55 to engage in the compulsion.
3670.14 Now some of this might
sound to people like, oh,
3672.99 this is a lot of kind of fancy
3674.28 psychological neuroscience speak
3675.87 around something that's kind of intuitive.
3677.4 But I think for most people,
this is not intuitive.
3680.85 And for people with OCD,
3684.27 there's no really other way to put it,
3685.71 the impulse, the
compulsion to avoid anxiety
3689.49 is such a powerful driving force
3691.77 that it should now make sense to you
3693.06 as to why being able to tolerate anxiety
3695.76 and really sit with it
and do the exact opposite
3698.16 of what you're normally compelled to do
3699.72 is going to be the path to treatment.
3701.49 And indeed CBT has been shown
to be enormously effective,
3705.03 again for a large number
of people with OCD,
3707.88 but not all of them.
3708.99 And oftentimes it requires that it also be
3711.99 used in concert with
certain drug treatments,
3714.24 which we're going to
talk about in a moment.
3716.25 Next, let's talk about some
of the really unique features
3718.62 of cognitive behavioral
therapy and exposure therapy
3720.81 in the context of OCD
that you often don't see
3724.35 in the use of CBT, that is
cognitive behavioral therapy,
3728.28 for other types of psychiatric
challenges and disorders.
3732.03 The first element is one of stair casing.
3735.39 And I already mentioned this before,
3737.07 but this gradual and progressive increase
3741.0 in the anxiety that you're
trying to evoke from the patient,
3744.54 from the person suffering from OCD.
3747.0 That's done in the context of
the office or the laboratory,
3751.08 again, by a trained
and licensed clinician.
3754.74 But then the person leaves, right?
3756.78 They leave the office,
they leave the laboratory.
3760.2 And a very vital component
3762.12 of CBT and exposure
therapy for people with OCD
3764.94 is that they have and perform
what's called homework,
3768.42 is literally what they call.
3770.16 This might be seen in
other sorts of treatments
3771.99 but for OCD, homework
is extremely important,
3775.32 because within the context
3776.85 of a laboratory experiment or the clinic,
3778.74 patients often feel so much support
3780.81 that they can tolerate
those heightened levels
3782.4 of anxiety and interrupt
their compulsions.
3784.77 Whereas when they get home,
3785.91 oftentimes the familiarity
of the environment
3788.34 brings 'em to a place
where all of a sudden
3789.93 those obsessions and compulsions start
3792.15 interacting the same way
3793.2 and they have a very hard time
suppressing the behaviors.
3796.65 Why would that be?
3797.73 Well in neuroscience, we have a phrase,
3800.31 it's called conditioned place preference
3802.02 and conditioned place avoidance.
3803.7 There's some other phrases too
3804.72 but basically it all has to do
3806.31 with a simple thing which is,
3809.13 when you feel something
repeatedly in a given environment,
3811.74 or sometimes even once
within a given environment,
3813.96 you tend to feel that same thing again
3816.39 when you return to that
or similar environments.
3818.76 Okay, So conditioned place blank,
3820.14 or conditioned place that
is simply fancy nerd speak
3822.99 for the fact that when you're in a place
3824.97 and something good happens,
3826.38 you tend to feel good if
you return to that place
3828.09 or a place like it, or
if something bad happens
3830.67 in a given place, you tend to feel bad
3832.11 when you return to that
place or a place like it.
3834.9 I think that most salient
example that leaps to mind
3837.2 is in, unfortunately, the category of bad,
3838.98 but I had some friends years
ago visit San Francisco.
3842.46 There's been a ongoing,
3843.72 it seems like it's been happening forever,
3845.49 but this is really in the last decade
3846.75 of daytime break-ins and
nighttime break-ins into cars
3850.74 to steal anything from computers
3852.96 to what seems to be like a box of tissues.
3854.64 And there are numerous reasons for this,
3856.47 I don't want to get into,
3857.303 it's not the topic of today's podcast,
3858.78 but I will use this as
an opportunity to say
3860.16 if you're visiting
anywhere in the Bay Area,
3861.99 do not leave anything in your car
3863.13 because the window will get broken into,
3864.96 sometimes in broad daylight.
3866.4 Some good friends of mine
were visiting the Bay Area
3868.5 and I texted them and said,
3870.96 hey, by the way, when you're
headed to dinner, guys,
3872.94 make sure you bring in all
your luggage and computers
3876.18 however inconvenient that might be.
3878.37 They wrote back, too late,
everything got stolen.
3881.31 So some years ago now, I
think five, six years ago
3883.29 this happened, sadly,
everything got stolen.
3886.62 Most of it could be replaced,
3887.58 but some of it was very
sentimental to them.
3889.68 Every time we talk, every time we consider
3892.71 having a meeting in a particular city,
3894.45 this comes up as I don't want to be there,
3896.67 I don't like that city anymore, et cetera.
3898.29 And of course, San
Francisco has some wonderful
3899.82 redeeming features, but it
only takes one bad incident
3902.61 in one location to kind of color
3904.38 the whole picture dark, so to speak.
3907.86 The brain works that way.
3909.12 The brain generalizes, it's
not a very specific organ,
3912.36 again, it's a prediction machine
3913.65 in addition to other things.
3915.03 So in the case of CBT therapy,
3917.82 the reason there's homework
is that when people go home,
3920.85 oftentimes that's when they relapse,
3923.46 if you want to call it that,
3924.48 back into their obsessions
and compulsions.
3926.28 And that location, that conditioned place
3930.42 is where it becomes most
important to challenge
3933.03 the anxiety and to deal with the anxiety,
3934.89 to not try and suppress the anxiety
3936.42 through compulsions or other means.
3938.88 And when I say other means, I
want to highlight something,
3941.73 it will come up again a little
bit later in the podcast,
3943.83 that substance abuse is very
common in people with OCD
3947.31 because of the anxiety component
3948.96 and also because of people's feelings
3950.79 that they just can't
escape from the thoughts
3952.71 or behavioral patterns that
are so characteristic of OCD.
3957.03 So alcohol abuse or cannabis abuse,
3959.27 or other forms of narcotics abuse
3962.13 are very common in OCD.
3965.4 Later, we'll talk about
whether or not cannabis
3966.96 can or cannot help with OCD.
3969.96 But needless to say,
3971.88 suppressing anxiety is
exactly the wrong direction
3975.36 that one should take if
the goal is to ultimately
3978.87 relieve or eliminate the OCD.
3981.51 So we now have two characteristics
of CBT exposure therapy
3985.26 that are extremely important for OCD
3987.06 and somewhat unique to
the treatment of OCD
3989.07 and that's the staircasing up
towards the really bad fear,
3991.68 the really severe and
specific articulation
3994.98 and understanding and
feeling of how bad things
3997.38 really would be if someone engaged
3999.69 in a particular behavior or
avoided a particular behavior.
4002.03 Then there's the component of homework
4003.95 given by the clinician for
the person to be able to
4007.43 create a broader set of context
4009.56 in which they can deal with the anxiety,
4012.71 not engage in the compulsions.
4014.45 And then a very unique
feature of treatment of OCD
4017.72 that you don't see in many
other psychiatric disorders
4020.81 are home visits.
4022.19 And I find this fascinating.
4023.66 I think that the field of
psychiatry and psychology
4026.51 traditionally doesn't allow
for or invite home visits,
4030.74 but this component of
context, location and context
4035.06 being so vital to the
treatment and relief of OCD
4039.89 has inspired many
psychiatrists and psychologists
4043.64 to get permission to do home visits
4046.13 where they actually go
visit their patients
4047.72 in their native setting,
in their home cages, right?
4050.24 They're not mice, but in
their home-home cages,
4052.82 I'm being facetious here, but people,
4054.38 mice live in cages, at
least in the laboratory,
4056.15 and humans generally live
in houses or elsewhere,
4059.54 so they visit them in their home
4062.45 in order to see how they're interacting
4064.61 and the particular locations that evoke
4066.89 the most anxiety and the least anxiety.
4068.66 Some of the, I don't want
to call them crutches,
4070.58 but some of the tools
that people are using
4073.16 to confront and deal with the
obsessions and compulsions
4076.94 and in particular to try and identify
4079.16 some of the tools and tricks
4081.98 that people are using to try and avoid
4084.32 that heightened anxiety,
because, once again,
4086.69 and I know I'm repeating myself,
4087.8 but I think this is just
so vital and so unique
4090.17 about OCD and the treatment of OCD,
4092.51 the critical need for the
patient to be able to tolerate
4095.42 extremely elevated levels
of anxiety is so crucial.
4100.19 So if people are avoiding
certain rooms in the house,
4103.19 or if people are avoiding certain foods
4105.98 or certain locations in the kitchen,
4107.66 the clinician can start to identify that
4109.52 by mere observation.
4111.23 And I should mention here that patients
4113.48 are not always aware of
how they're interacting
4116.72 with their home environment.
4117.83 Some of these patterns are
so deeply ingrained in people
4120.683 that they don't even realize that they're
4122.81 constantly turning to the left,
4124.13 or they don't even realize that
4125.6 they're only washing their
hands on one side of the sink.
4127.79 And so the clinician,
by visiting the home,
4130.01 can start to interrogate
a bit in a polite way,
4132.58 in a friendly, in a supportive way
4134.33 as to, do you ever think
about why you always
4137.6 flip the faucet to the left
4139.16 or flip the faucet to
the right, et cetera.
4141.53 Now, we all do a lot of
things that are habitual.
4145.76 We all do things that are
4148.31 somewhat regular from day to day.
4150.11 In fact, I would invite
you to ask yourself,
4153.11 do you always put your
toothbrush in the same location?
4156.53 Do you always cap the toothbrush
4158.06 before or after you use it?
4159.41 What sorts of things do you-
4160.243 You wipe the little threading
on the toothpaste or not?
4163.58 I'm somebody, I confess that I have,
4166.43 well, I have about 3,500 pet peeves,
4168.77 but one of my pet peeves
4169.67 is toothpaste kind of on the
thread of the toothpaste.
4172.55 It really bothers me, I don't know why,
4174.26 almost as much as trying
to wipe it off bothers me,
4176.87 which creates a certain challenge.
4178.19 And if I talk about this any further,
4179.75 then I think I would qualify
4180.77 for obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.
4183.47 But I have to say, I don't experience
4184.64 a ton of anxiety about it.
4185.84 It doesn't govern my life.
4187.04 In fact, I realize that right now
4188.72 there are tubes of toothpaste
4190.67 that have toothpaste along the thread
4192.2 everywhere in the world
4193.635 and it doesn't really bother me.
4194.468 I can still sit here and
provide some information
4197.78 about OCD to you.
4198.62 It's not intrusive, at
least not to my awareness.
4202.25 So by the home visit,
4203.96 the therapist can really start to explore
4206.12 through direct questioning
and can allow the patient
4209.21 to explore through direct
questioning of themselves
4211.46 the things that they might be conscious of
4212.81 and the things that they
might not be conscious of
4215.27 that would qualify for OCD.
4217.61 So I'd like to just briefly
summarize the key elements
4220.25 of cognitive behavioral
therapy and exposure therapy
4223.37 and how they can be combined
with drug treatments
4226.19 that are very effective.
4228.29 Much of what I'm going to talk about next
4229.91 relates to the data
and indeed the practice
4233.54 of an incredible research
scientist and clinician.
4238.25 So this is Helen Blair Simpson,
4240.14 or I should say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson,
4242.12 because she is indeed an MD medical doctor
4244.43 and a PhD research scientist
4246.05 at Columbia University School of Medicine.
4249.23 And one of the world's foremost experts,
4252.29 if not the expert, I would
put her in a category
4254.78 of maybe just one to three people who
4257.96 is most knowledgeable about
the mechanisms of OCD,
4261.47 is actively researching OCD in humans,
4264.74 trying to find new treatments,
4266.15 trying to unveil new mechanisms
4268.76 and expand on our current
understanding and who also treats
4272.24 OCD quite actively in her own clinic.
4276.2 Dr. Simpson gave a beautiful presentation
4279.32 which she summarized
some of the core elements
4281.96 of CBT and exposure therapy
4283.73 for the treatment of
obsessive-compulsive disorders.
4286.19 She describes that the key
procedures are exposures,
4289.34 of course, done in person
4292.07 and with the actual thing that evokes
4294.2 the obsessions and compulsions.
4296.45 So this could be the sweaty
towel as described earlier,
4299.63 or could be any number of
different triggers done
4303.38 with the patient in real time,
4305.09 so in vivo, as we say.
4307.1 And it could also be
things that are imaginal,
4310.25 sitting somebody down in a chair,
4312.05 in an office and saying,
4313.34 okay, I want you to imagine the thing
4315.95 that triggers the intrusive thought,
4317.36 or let's just focus on the
intrusive thought as it arises,
4321.05 and then to explore and expose the patient
4323.18 to their obsessions and
compulsions that way.
4324.77 So it can be real, or it can be imaginal.
4326.9 And the goal, of course, then
4328.25 is to gradually and progressively
4330.92 increase the level of anxiety,
4332.45 but then to intervene in
so-called ritual prevention
4335.39 to prevent the person from
engaging in the compulsion.
4338.3 The goals, again I'm paraphrasing here,
4340.91 are to, as she states, disconfirm fears
4344.33 and challenge the beliefs
about the obsessions
4348.77 and compulsions, to
intervene in the thoughts
4350.96 and the behaviors, and to break the habit
4352.43 of ritualizing and avoiding.
4354.11 Now, how is this typically done?
4355.46 What are the nuts and
bolts of this procedure?
4358.49 Typically, this is done
through two planning sessions
4362.33 with the patient.
4363.163 So describing to the
patient what will happen
4365.45 and when it will happen
and how long it will happen
4367.79 so that they're not just thrown into this
4370.01 out of the blue.
4371.09 And then 15 exposure sessions
done twice a week or more.
4375.71 So the one thing to really understand
4377.12 about cognitive behavioral therapy
4378.5 is that it can take some period of time,
4380.24 several or more weeks, as
many as 10 or 12 weeks.
4383.48 However, as you'll soon learn,
4385.16 many of the drug treatments
that are effective
4386.9 in treating OCD either
alone or in combination
4389.75 with behavioral therapies
also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks
4393.44 or longer, and many of
those never work at all.
4396.08 So even though 10 to 12 weeks
4397.76 seems like a long period of time,
4399.14 it's actually a pretty standard.
4400.4 If you'd like to see
more complete description
4402.59 of the protocols for
cognitive behavioral therapy
4404.63 and exposure therapy for OCD,
4406.73 I'll provide links to two papers,
4408.29 Kozak and Foa, F-O-A,
4410.63 which is published in 1997,
4412.31 which might seem like a long time ago,
4413.6 but nonetheless, that the
protocols are still very useful.
4416.51 And then the second paper
is by that last author,
4419.0 FOA et al in 2012
4420.8 and we'll provide links to both of those.
4422.96 In addition, Dr. Blair Simpson and others
4425.93 have explored what are the best treatments
4428.66 for patients with OCD by comparing
4431.36 cognitive behavioral
therapy alone, placebo,
4434.27 so essentially no intervention
4437.06 or something that takes an
equivalent amount of time
4439.13 but is not thought to be
effective in treatment.
4443.09 As well as selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
4447.38 So what is an SSRI?
4449.721 An SSRI is a drug that
prevents the re-uptake
4453.05 of serotonin at the synapse.
4454.82 What are synapses?
4455.653 They're the little spaces between neurons
4457.58 where neurons communicate with one another
4459.53 by vomiting little bits of
chemical into the space,
4462.68 the synapse, and then those
chemicals either evoke
4466.01 or suppress the electrical activity
4467.9 of the next neuron across the synapse.
4470.72 And in this case, the neurotransmitter,
4472.58 the chemical that we're
referring to is serotonin.
4475.01 SSRI, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors
4478.67 prevent the reuptake of
the chemical that's left,
4483.02 in this case, the serotonin
that's left in the synapse.
4485.39 After that, I call it
vomiting to be dramatic,
4488.15 but it's not actually vomiting,
4489.17 the extrusion of the
chemical into the synapse.
4492.71 And as a consequence,
there's more serotonin around
4495.8 to have more of an effect over time,
4497.72 the net effect being more
serotonergic transmission,
4500.69 more serotonin overall.
4502.67 So not more serotonin being made,
4504.47 more serotonin being available for use,
4506.87 that's what an SSRI does.
4508.67 So they compared cognitive
behavioral therapy, SSRIs,
4513.47 they also had the placebo group
4514.7 and they had cognitive behavioral therapy
4516.2 plus the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor.
4519.95 This was a 12-week study
done as described before,
4522.71 two times a week over
the course of 12 weeks.
4525.38 First of all, the most
important thing, of course,
4528.38 placebo did nothing.
4529.52 It did not relieve the OCD
to any significant degree.
4534.86 How did they know that?
4535.693 They gave them the Y-BOCS test
4536.96 that we talked about
before, the Yale-Brown test
4540.59 with all those questions
of which I read a few.
4542.96 So the OCD severity that one has to have
4546.56 on the Y-BOCS is measured
in terms of an index
4549.23 that goes from here from
8 all the way up to 28,
4552.86 that shouldn't mean anything.
4553.99 So that number eight is
kind of meaningless here.
4555.89 It's in terms of an index
that's only meaningful
4558.29 for the Y-BOCS, but if
somebody has a threshold
4561.35 of 16 or higher, it means
that they're still having
4564.11 somewhat debilitating symptoms
4565.43 or very debilitating symptoms.
4567.17 Placebo did not reduce the
obsessions or compulsions
4570.41 to any significant degree.
4572.27 However, and I think quite excitingly,
4574.49 cognitive behavioral
therapy had a dramatic
4578.57 effect in reducing the
obsessions and compulsions
4582.32 such that by four weeks, that
score that, in this case,
4586.01 ranged from 8 to 28,
4587.27 dropped all the way from
25 down to about 11.
4591.38 So it's a huge drop in the
severity of the symptoms.
4595.19 Now, what's really interesting
4596.6 is that when you look
at the effects of SSRIs
4599.48 in the treatment of OCD symptoms,
4602.9 they had a significant effect
in reducing the symptoms
4605.96 of OCD that showed up first at four weeks,
4608.78 and then continued to eight weeks.
4611.3 In fact, there was a progressive
and further reduction
4614.45 in OCD symptoms from the
four to eight week period.
4617.12 Again, these are the people
just taking the SSRI,
4619.97 and then it sort of
flattened out a little bit,
4621.65 such that by 12 weeks,
4623.09 there was still a significant
reduction in OCD symptoms
4625.76 for people taking SSRIs
as compared to placebo.
4629.0 But the severity of their symptoms
4631.4 was still much greater than those
4634.01 receiving cognitive
behavioral therapy alone.
4636.59 So at least in this study,
4638.15 and I should tell you which study it is,
4639.68 this is Foa, Liebowitz et al 2005
4641.99 in the American Journal of Psychiatry,
4643.4 we'll also provide a link to this
4644.81 so you can peruse the data if you like.
4647.06 But at least in this study,
4648.44 cognitive behavioral therapy
was the most effective,
4651.35 selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, less effective.
4655.13 So what happens when you combine them?
4656.72 Well, they explored that as well,
4658.13 and the combination of
cognitive behavioral therapy
4660.253 and the SSRIs together
4662.81 did not lead to any further
decrease in OCD symptoms.
4668.33 This points to the idea that
cognitive behavioral therapy
4671.48 is the most effective treatment.
4672.83 And again, when I say
cognitive behavioral therapy,
4674.54 now I'm still referring
to cognitive behavioral,
4676.52 slash, exposure therapy done in the way
4678.77 that I detailed before,
4679.61 twice a week for 12 weeks or more.
4681.95 So all of the data, at
least in this study,
4683.69 point to the fact that
cognitive behavioral therapy
4685.88 is really effective
and the most effective.
4688.43 Does it alleviate OCD
symptoms for everybody?
4691.91 No.
4692.743 Is it very time consuming? Yes.
4693.92 Twice a week for two sessions
or more of 15 minutes,
4697.73 sometimes in the office,
plus there's homework,
4699.8 plus, in an ideal case,
there's also home visits
4702.29 from the psychiatrist or psychologist,
4704.24 that's a lot of investment,
a lot of time investment,
4708.53 to say nothing of the
potential financial investment.
4711.59 Now, Dr. Blair Simpson has
given some beautiful talks
4714.35 where she describes these data
4717.29 and also emphasizes the fact that
4719.75 despite the demonstrated power
4722.3 of cognitive behavioral therapy
for the treatment of OCD,
4725.15 most people are given drug treatments
4726.62 simply because of the availability
of those drug treatments.
4729.05 Now, when I say most people,
4730.083 I want to emphasize that I'm referring
4731.72 to most people who
actually go seek treatment
4734.75 because a really
important thing to realize
4736.82 is that most people with OCD
4738.71 do not actually go seek
evidence-based treatment.
4741.92 I want to repeat that,
most people with OCD
4743.72 do not seek evidence-based treatment,
4745.58 which is a tragic thing.
4746.87 One of the motivations for
doing this podcast episode
4749.57 is to try and encourage people
4751.16 who think they may have
persistent obsessions
4753.2 and compulsions to seek treatment,
4756.11 but most people don't
for a variety of reasons
4759.77 we spelled out earlier, shame, et cetera.
4762.68 Of those that do, the first line of attack
4765.35 is typically a prescription,
most often an SSRI,
4769.37 although not always just SSRIs
4771.35 because soon we'll talk
about the somewhat common use
4775.46 of also prescribing a
low dose of a neuroleptic
4779.11 or an antipsychotic, not always but often.
4782.57 So the important thing to understand here
4784.79 is that excellent
researchers like Dr. Simpson
4787.58 understand that while there are treatments
4789.92 that we could say are best or are ideal
4792.8 based on the data, that
doesn't necessarily mean
4794.84 that's what's being deployed
4796.73 most often in the general public.
4798.65 As a consequence, Dr. Simpson and others
4801.47 have explored in a very practical way
4804.53 whether or not it matters if somebody
4807.14 is getting SSRI treatment
4809.87 and is experiencing that
reduction in OCD symptoms
4814.28 that as you may recall, is more than
4817.16 what they would experience
with placebo alone,
4819.95 but not as dramatic a
reduction in OCD symptoms
4822.4 as they would get with
cognitive behavioral therapy.
4825.05 And as I mentioned before,
there was this exploration
4827.54 of combining drug treatment
4829.16 with cognitive behavioral
therapy from the outset,
4831.47 but they also quite impressively explored
4834.17 what happens when people
who are already taking SSRIs
4837.29 initiate cognitive behavioral therapy.
4839.51 This is a really wonderful thing
4841.04 that they've done this
because in doing that,
4843.74 first of all, they're acknowledging that
4845.42 there are many people out
there who have sought treatment
4847.25 and are getting some
relief from those SSRIs,
4849.8 but it perhaps is not as much
relief as they could get.
4852.59 And they are actively
acknowledging that many people
4856.34 are getting these drug treatments first.
4858.29 In fact, most often people are getting
4859.61 these drug treatments first.
4861.26 So what happens when you add in
4863.33 cognitive behavioral therapy?
4864.62 Well, the good news is when you add
4865.91 cognitive behavioral therapy
4867.98 to someone who's already taking SSRIs,
4870.83 that further improves their symptoms.
4873.2 Now that's different than the results
4876.32 that I described before
4878.15 from the same laboratory in fact,
4880.49 that if you combine
cognitive behavioral therapy
4883.52 with SSRIs from the outset,
4885.62 there's no additional benefit of SSRI.
4889.37 However, as I just described,
4890.84 if someone is already taking an SSRI
4893.06 and they're experiencing a
reduction in their OCD symptoms,
4897.38 by adding in cognitive behavioral therapy,
4900.11 there is a further reduction
in the symptoms of OCD.
4904.624 This is very important.
4905.457 So for those of you that
have sought treatment
4906.8 and you're taking a SSRI,
4909.01 or if you're thinking about treatment
4910.46 and you're prescribed an SSRI,
4912.08 the ideal scenario really would be
4913.52 to combine the drug treatment
4915.02 with cognitive behavioral therapy,
4916.46 or in some cases, maybe cognitive
behavioral therapy alone,
4918.83 although that's a decision
that you really have to make
4920.96 with the close
4923.24 advice and oversight of
a licensed physician,
4926.69 because, of course, these
are prescription drugs.
4928.7 And anytime you're going to add or remove
4930.68 a prescription drug or change dosage,
4932.21 you really want to do that
in close discussion with
4934.657 and on the advice of your physician.
4936.59 I don't just say that to protect me,
4937.7 I say that to protect you
4939.067 'cause it's just the right thing to do.
4940.64 So again, cognitive behavioral therapy
4942.65 is extremely powerful.
4943.88 Drug treatments seem less powerful though.
4946.07 If you're already on a drug treatment,
4947.36 adding cognitive behavioral
therapy can really help.
4949.67 So I've been talking about SSRIs
4951.02 and described a little
bit about how they work
4952.55 at a kind of superficial level of
4954.65 keeping more serotonin in the synapse
4956.6 so that more serotonin can be in action
4959.57 as opposed to gobbled
back up by those neurons.
4962.57 I should just mention what some
4963.47 of the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors are.
4966.23 So things like clomipramine,
4969.5 which is not entirely selective,
4972.74 I should say that that one generally falls
4974.87 into a category of less selective.
4976.61 So it can impair
4979.13 or can enhance some of
the other neurotransmitter
4982.63 or neuromodulator systems
like epinephrine, et cetera.
4985.85 The selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors are,
4989.42 at least the classic ones
are, fluoxetine, Prozac,
4991.91 fluvoxamine, Luvox,
paroxetine, sertraline,
4995.6 citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
4999.08 There are about six or classic SSRIs,
5001.9 some of them like citalopram
5003.43 are used in children and are available
5006.37 in pediatric doses.
5007.87 Some like Prozac may or may
not be used in children.
5010.66 The details of which SSRIs, et cetera,
5013.72 is a very extensive
literature and discussion.
5016.18 And I think it's safe to say that
5019.09 which drugs to use and which dosage
5021.43 and whether or not to continue, excuse me,
5024.1 the same dosage over time depends a lot
5026.32 on the individual variation
that people express
5028.93 and the responses that they have.
5030.49 All of these drugs, in
fact, I think we can say
5032.71 all drugs have side effects.
5034.93 The question is how detrimental
those side effects are
5038.59 to daily life.
5039.423 The SSRIs are well known to
have effects on appetite.
5042.4 In some cases, they abolish appetite.
5044.92 In some cases, they just
reduce it a little bit.
5046.96 In some cases, they increase appetite.
5049.12 Really is highly individual.
5050.77 They can have effects on libido.
5052.36 For instance, they can reduce sex drive,
5055.72 sometimes in a dose dependent way,
5057.16 sometimes in a way that's
more like a step function
5059.38 where people are fine at
say 5 or 10 milligrams,
5062.11 but then they get to 15 milligrams
5065.02 and there's a cliff for their libido.
5068.86 That can happen, it really depends.
5070.54 Please don't take those
dosages as exact values
5072.7 'cause this is going to depend on
5074.8 what they're being used for,
depression or anxiety or OCD,
5077.62 and it's also going to depend
on the drug, et cetera.
5079.45 I just threw out those numbers as a way
5081.634 to illustrate what a
kind of a step function
5083.47 would look like.
5084.303 It's not gradual, it's
immediate at a given dose
5086.2 is what that means.
5087.7 The other thing is that
some of these drugs
5090.88 will have transient effects.
5092.92 So side effects that show
up and then disappear
5094.75 or sadly people will
sometimes take these drugs
5097.24 for a while and then side
effects will surface later
5099.13 that weren't there previously
5100.9 depending on life factors,
nutrition factors.
5103.06 So it's a very complicated
landscape overall.
5105.85 And that's why it's really
important to explore
5107.5 any kind of drug treatment,
SSRI or otherwise,
5109.99 really in close communication
with a psychiatrist
5112.33 who really understands
the pharmacokinetics
5114.19 and has a lot of patient history
5115.63 and experience with them.
5117.13 So what I'm about to tell you next
5118.39 is most certainly going
to come as a big surprise,
5120.79 which is that despite the fact
5122.92 that the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors
5124.96 can be effective in reducing
the symptoms of OCD,
5127.72 at least somewhat,
5129.25 and certainly more than placebo,
5131.29 there is very little, if any evidence,
5133.81 that the serotonin system
is disrupted in OCD.
5136.84 And I have to point out that this is
5138.67 a somewhat consistent theme
in the field of psychiatry,
5142.3 that is a given drug can be very effective
5145.33 or even partially effective
in reducing symptoms
5148.54 or in changing the overall landscape
5150.88 of a psychiatric disorder or illness,
5153.64 and yet there is very little,
5156.1 if any evidence, that
that particular system
5158.05 is what's causal for OCD, or anxiety,
5162.55 or depression, et cetera.
5163.81 This is just the landscape
that we're living in
5165.46 in terms of our understanding of the brain
5166.99 and psychiatry and the ways
of treating brain disorders.
5169.72 So as a consequence,
there are a huge number
5172.51 of academic reviews that
clinicians and research scientists
5175.72 have generated and read and share.
5178.33 One of the more, I think, thorough ones
5182.44 in recent years was published in 2021.
5184.78 I'll provide a link to this.
5185.71 This is by an excellent,
truly excellent researcher
5189.13 from Yale university School of Medicine,
5191.26 I should say not just a researcher
5192.49 but a clinician scientist,
again, an MD-PhD.
5195.01 This is Christopher Pittenger
5197.17 And the title of the review
5198.19 is Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies
5201.97 and New Targets in OCD.
5204.43 And again, we'll provide a link to it.
5206.74 This is a just gorgeous review describing,
5209.68 as I just told you, that
the serotonin system
5211.48 isn't really disrupted in OCD
5213.37 and yet SSRIs can be very effective.
5216.04 The review goes on to explore
even what sorts of receptors
5220.12 for serotonin might be involved.
5221.83 If it's in fact the case that serotonin
5225.07 is a culprit in the
creation of OCD symptoms.
5231.43 Talk about the serotonin 2A receptor
5233.83 and the serotonin 1A receptor.
5235.18 Why am I mentioning all that detail?
5236.8 If in fact it's not clear,
5238.27 serotonin is involved because
5240.25 I'll just tell you right now,
5241.84 there is currently a lot of interest
5243.19 in whether or not some
of the psychedelics,
5245.32 in particular psilocybin, can be effective
5247.077 in the treatment of OCD.
5249.52 Psilocybin has been shown
in various clinical trials
5252.58 in particular the clinical trials done
5254.05 at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
5255.88 by Matthew Johnson and others.
5257.65 Matthew was on The Huberman Lab Podcast.
5259.42 He's been on the Tim Ferris podcast.
5261.04 He's been on the Lex Fridman podcast.
5262.99 He's a world class researcher
5264.28 on the use of psychedelics for depression
5266.56 and other psychiatric challenges.
5269.5 And their psilocybin treatment
5271.72 has been seen, at least in those trials,
5273.61 to be very effective in the treatment
5275.11 of certain kinds of major depression.
5278.08 Currently the exploration of psilocybin
5280.21 for the treatment of OCD
5282.1 has not yielded similar results,
5283.75 although the studies are ongoing.
5285.46 Again, has not yielded
similar effectiveness,
5287.53 but the studies are ongoing
5289.12 And the serotonin 2A receptor
5291.07 and the serotonin 1A receptors
5292.75 are primary targets for
the drug psilocybin.
5296.44 So I figured there were
going to be some questions
5297.88 about whether or not
psychedelics help with OCD,
5300.79 thus far it's inconclusive.
5303.04 If any of you have been
part of clinical trials
5305.47 or have knowledge or intuition
about this relationship
5308.59 or potential relationship, I should say,
5310.09 between psilocybin and other psychedelics
5311.92 in OCD, please put them
in the comment section.
5313.93 We'd love to love to hear from you.
5317.14 One thing I should point out
5318.64 is that even though serotonin
5320.56 has not been directly implicated in OCD,
5323.05 serotonin and the general
systems of serotonin,
5325.72 the circuits in the brain
that carry serotonin
5327.55 and depend on it have been shown
5329.98 to impact cognitive
flexibility and inflexibility,
5333.91 which are kind of hallmark themes of OCD.
5336.1 So in animals that have
their serotonin depleted
5339.13 or in humans that have very
low levels of serotonin,
5341.95 you can see evidence of
cognitive inflexibility,
5345.88 challenges in tasks, switching challenges
5348.04 and switching the rules by
which one performs a game,
5350.83 challenges in any kind of
cognitive domain switching.
5354.94 And so that does indirectly implicate
5357.34 serotonin in some of the aspects of OCD.
5360.1 Again, when one starts to explore
5361.81 the different transmitter systems
5363.31 that have been explored in
animal models and in humans,
5366.07 it's a vast, vast landscape,
5367.81 but serotonergic drugs do seem to be
5370.9 the most effective drugs in treating OCD
5372.97 despite the fact, again, despite the fact
5375.97 that there's no direct evidence
5377.23 that serotonin systems
are the problem in OCD.
5382.12 If you recall the
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop
5385.18 that is so central to the etiology,
5388.93 the presence and the
patterns of symptoms in OCD,
5392.5 of course, serotonin is
impacting that system.
5394.66 Serotonin is impacting just
about every system in the brain,
5397.39 but there's no evidence that
5399.19 tinkering with serotonin levels,
5400.63 specifically in that network,
5402.82 is what's leading to
the improvements in OCD.
5406.54 However, if people go into a FMRI scanner
5410.26 and those people have OCD
5411.58 and they evoke the
obsessions and compulsions,
5413.41 you see activity in that
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop.
5417.43 Treatments like SSRIs that
reduce the symptoms of OCD
5421.9 equate to a situation where
there is less activity
5424.6 in that loop.
5426.13 And I should point out
cognitive behavioral therapy,
5429.22 which we have no reason to believe
5430.9 only taps into the serotonin system,
5432.58 I think it would be extreme stretch,
5434.8 it would be false actually to say
5436.636 that that cognitive
behavioral therapy taps
5438.07 only into the serotonin system,
5439.63 clearly it's going to affect
a huge number of circuits
5441.7 in neurochemical systems.
5443.05 Well, people who do
cognitive behavioral therapy
5445.66 and find some relief for OCD,
5447.55 they also show reductions
5449.08 in those cortico-striatal-thalamic loops.
5451.84 So basically we have a situation
5453.25 where we have a behavioral
therapy that works,
5456.04 in many people, not all,
5457.87 and we have a pretty good understanding
5459.1 of about why it works.
5460.12 It increases anxiety tolerance,
5461.95 and interference with pattern execution,
5467.02 getting people to not engage
5468.82 in the same sorts of behaviors
5470.35 that are detrimental to them.
5472.18 And we have drug treatments that work
5474.28 at least to some degree,
5475.24 but we don't know how they work
5476.5 or where they work in the brain.
5477.85 One of the things that really unifies
5480.01 the behavioral treatments
and the drug treatments
5483.4 is that they take some period of time.
5485.44 Some relief from symptoms seems to show up
5487.33 around four weeks and
certainly by eight weeks
5489.88 for both cognitive behavioral
therapy and the SSRIs,
5493.21 but it's really at the 10 to 12 week stage
5496.39 when someone's been
doing these twice a week,
5498.04 cognitive behavioral sessions,
5499.99 where they've been taking
a SSRI for 10 to 12 weeks,
5503.65 that the really significant reduction
5505.81 in OCD symptoms starts to really show up.
5509.17 Now, up until now, I've
been talking about the fact
5511.15 that people are getting
relief from these treatments,
5514.0 but sadly,
5515.71 in the case of OCD,
5517.3 there is a significant population
5520.54 that simply does not respond to CBT
5523.78 or to SSRIs, or to their combination,
5526.6 which is why psychiatrists
also explore the combination
5530.56 of SSRIs and neuroleptics
5533.47 or drugs that tap into the
so-called dopamine system
5536.17 or the glutamate system.
5537.43 These are other neurotransmitters
and neuromodulators
5540.04 that impact different
circuits in the brain.
5541.81 And just to really remind you
5543.07 what neurotransmitters
and neuromodulators do,
5545.17 because this is important
to contextualize all this,
5548.11 neurotransmitters are
typically involved in the
5550.99 rapid communication between neurons.
5552.82 And the two most common
neurotransmitters for that
5554.83 are the neurotransmitter glutamate,
5557.2 which we say is excitatory,
5558.818 meaning when it's
released into the synapse,
5560.311 it causes the next neuron to
be more active, or active,
5563.849 and GABA which is a neurotransmitter
5566.099 that is inhibitory,
meaning when it's released
5567.791 into the synapse, typically, not always,
5569.59 but typically, that GABA
is going to encourage
5572.32 the next neuron to be
less electrically active
5574.51 or even silence its activity.
5577.33 The neuromodulators, by contrast,
5579.82 So not neurotransmitters,
but neuromodulators
5581.98 like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
5583.96 and acetylcholine and others
5586.96 operate a little bit differently.
5588.49 They tend to act a
little bit more broadly.
5590.62 They can act within the synapse,
5592.33 but they can also change
the general patterns
5595.18 of activity in the brain,
5596.41 making certain circuits more likely
5598.27 to be active and other circuits
less likely to be active.
5601.42 So when we say dopamine does X
5603.73 or dopamine does Y, or serotonin does X
5605.77 or serotonin does Y,
5606.603 they don't really do one thing,
5608.14 they change the sort of overall tonality.
5610.57 They make it more likely or less likely
5612.1 that certain circuits will be active.
5613.84 You can think of them as
kind of activating playlists
5616.51 or genres of activity in the brain,
5619.54 rather than being involved
in the specific communication
5622.36 or specific songs, if you will,
5624.22 in this analogy, or discussions
between particular neurons.
5627.43 So when we hear that
SSRIs increase serotonin
5631.54 and reduce the symptoms of OCD,
5633.43 or a neuroleptic reduces
the amount of dopamine
5636.49 and makes people feel calmer for instance,
5639.79 or can remove some stereotype,
repetitive motor behavior,
5645.07 which they can either generate
5646.84 or reduce motor behavior it turns out.
5649.45 So when I say that, what I'm referring to
5651.24 is the fact that these neuromodulators
5652.96 are kind of turning up the
volume on certain circuits
5655.81 and turning down the
volume on other circuits.
5658.54 I say that because if
you are going to explore
5662.08 drug treatments again
with a licensed physician,
5665.44 if you're going to explore
drug treatments for OCD,
5668.38 and in particular, if you
are not getting results
5671.83 from SSRIs, or you're not getting results
5674.44 from cognitive behavioral therapy
5675.67 or the side effect profiles of the drugs
5677.59 that you're taking for OCD
5679.75 are causing problems that
you don't want to take them,
5683.11 well, then it's important to understand
5685.0 that anytime you take one of these drugs,
5687.13 they're not acting specifically
5688.81 on the cortico-striatal-thalamic circuit.
5691.51 That would be wonderful.
5692.343 That's the future of psychiatry,
5694.3 but as now, when you take a drug,
5697.36 it acts systemically.
5698.35 So it's impacting serotonin in your gut.
5700.6 It's also impacting serotonin
in other areas of the brain,
5702.79 hence the effects on things
like digestion or libido or
5708.1 any number of different things
5709.0 that serotonin is involved in.
5710.89 Likewise, if you take a
neuroleptic like haloperidol
5714.07 or something that reduces
dopamine transmission,
5717.58 well, then it's going to
have some motor effects
5719.41 'cause dopamine is
involved in the generation
5721.42 of motor sequences and
smooth limb movement.
5723.7 That's why people with Parkinson's
5724.81 who don't have much dopamine
will get a resting tremor,
5727.06 have a hard time
generating smooth movement.
5728.62 And so the side effects
start to make sense,
5731.08 given the huge number of
different neural circuits
5733.66 that these different
neuromodulators are involved in.
5736.0 I don't say that to be discouraging,
5738.01 I say that to encourage patients
5740.62 and careful systematic exploration
5743.05 of different drug treatments for OCD
5745.57 always again with the careful and close
5749.92 guidance and oversight of a psychiatrist
5752.08 because psychiatrists really understand
5753.7 which side effect profiles make it likely
5756.19 that you can or cannot or will never,
5760.51 or maybe someday will be
able to take a given drug
5762.61 at a given dose.
5763.63 They're the ones that
really have that knowledge.
5765.31 This is not the sort
of thing that you want
5766.78 to cowboy and go try
and figure out yourself.
5769.57 Now, I also want to acknowledge
5771.67 that there are other
forms of drug treatments.
5773.53 We touched on psilocybin briefly,
5775.15 but there are other
forms of drug treatments
5776.89 that have been explored for OCD.
5779.26 Earlier, we talked a
little bit about cannabis.
5781.24 Why would cannabis be a
place of exploration at all?
5785.68 Well, first of all,
5786.64 a number of people try
and self medicate for OCD.
5789.61 There is some clinical evidence,
5791.38 I'm not talking about recreational use,
5792.76 I'm talking about clinical evidence
5793.78 that cannabis can reduce anxiety.
5795.64 Now earlier we were talking about
5797.59 not reducing anxiety, but
learning anxiety tolerance
5801.07 in order to deal with and treat OCD
5804.16 in the context of cognitive
behavioral therapies.
5807.85 That doesn't necessarily rule out cannabis
5809.53 as a candidate for the treatment of OCD.
5812.707 And in fact, this has been explored.
5814.66 A study from Dr. Blair Simpson
herself looked at this.
5819.25 This was a fairly small scale study.
5820.96 So first of all, I'll give you the title.
5822.28 And again, we'll provide a link.
5823.39 This is entitled, Acute
effects of cannabinoids
5825.52 on symptoms of
obsessive-compulsive disorder:
5827.62 A human laboratory study.
5829.45 very briefly, this was 14 adults with OCD.
5832.12 They had prior experience with cannabis.
5834.43 This was randomized, placebo-controlled.
5836.59 The cannabis was smoked,
they had different varietals,
5840.64 as they're called.
5841.54 They had a placebo.
5842.44 So this is basically a condition
in which certain subjects
5846.82 consumed a cigarette that had 0% THC,
5850.27 others had 7% THC,
other groups that is, or
5855.04 some had 0.4% CBD and THC.
5857.98 So they looked at CBD.
5859.06 I know a lot of people out
there are interested in CBD.
5860.953 This is one of the few
studies I could find
5862.69 where they explored different percentages
5865.15 of THC and CBD in these
5868.15 cannabis or marijuana
cigarettes basically.
5871.0 The total amount that they consumed,
5872.92 I believe, was 800 milligrams.
5874.66 These, again, are not suggestions.
5876.73 These are just simply
reporting what's in this study.
5878.71 You can, again, I'll provide a link.
5881.65 They looked at OCD symptoms, ratings.
5884.74 They looked at cardiovascular effects.
5886.87 They had a large number
of different things
5888.55 that they explored.
5889.51 And I should say this
study was done in 2020,
5891.76 and it was the first
placebo-controlled investigation
5895.09 of cannabis in adults with
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
5898.12 Pretty interesting.
5899.2 And I'm just reading from
their conclusions here.
5901.6 The data suggests that smoked cannabis,
5903.31 whether containing primarily THC or CBD,
5906.52 remember they looked at
different concentrations
5908.02 of those, has little acute impact,
5910.33 meaning immediate impact on OCD symptoms
5913.87 and yield smaller reductions in anxiety
5915.85 compared to placebo.
5917.17 So they did not see a, when
I say a positive effect,
5920.44 I mean a ameliorative effect,
5923.23 an effect in reducing symptoms of OCD
5925.69 from cannabis or CBD,
5927.67 which, it's unfortunate.
5929.74 I think it's unfortunate anytime
a treatment doesn't work.
5931.6 But nonetheless, those are the data,
5932.89 I'm sure there are going
to be other studies.
5934.54 I'm sure there are also going to be people
5935.71 in the YouTube comments section saying
5937.57 that cannabis and CBD
helps their OCD symptoms,
5941.62 at least I anticipate there probably will.
5944.05 Almost everything I say here,
5945.16 somebody will contradict it with something
5946.72 from their experience, which
I encourage, by the way.
5948.94 I want to hear about your
experience with certain things
5951.31 even if it's not from randomized
placebo-controlled studies,
5954.4 I still find it very interesting
5955.87 to know what people are doing
and what they're experiencing.
5958.27 I think that's one of the
better uses of social media
5960.49 comment sections, is to be
able to share some of that,
5962.65 not in an advice-giving
way or prescriptive way,
5965.26 but simply as a way to share and encourage
5967.42 different types of exploration.
5969.07 There are other sorts of drug treatments
5970.36 that are gaining popularity for OCD,
5972.97 at least in the research realm.
5974.74 One treatment that is a legal, L-E-G-A-L.
5978.22 Sometimes when I say legal,
5979.18 sometimes people think I say
illegal, but that is legal,
5981.61 at least by prescription in
the United States, is ketamine.
5985.87 The actions of ketamine
are somewhat complex
5989.38 although we know, for instance,
5990.55 that ketamine acts on
the glutamate system,
5992.71 it tends to disrupt the transmission
5996.43 or the relationship, I should say,
5998.53 between glutamate, not glutamine,
6001.23 not the amino acid, but
glutamate, the neurotransmitter,
6004.29 and the so-called NMDA, the
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor,
6007.89 which is a receptor that's very special
6010.59 in the nervous system
because when glutamate binds
6012.72 to the NMDA receptor, it tends to
6016.23 offer the opportunity for
that particular synapse
6018.42 to get stronger, so-called neuroplasticity
6020.64 and ketamine is a,
essentially, an antagonist,
6024.42 although it works through
a complicated mechanism,
6026.4 it tends to block that
6028.44 binding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor
6031.47 or the effectiveness of that.
6032.67 Ketamine therapy is now
being used quite extensively
6035.67 for the treatment of
trauma and for depression.
6037.53 It leads to a dissociative state.
6039.54 It's a so-called dissociative analgesic
6042.954 in the variety of ways
in which that happens.
6044.67 We did an episode on depression.
6045.96 We're going to do another entire
episode all about ketamine
6048.87 describing the networks that
ketamine impacts, et cetera.
6051.24 Ketamine therapies are
being explored for OCD.
6054.06 As of now, the data
look somewhat promising,
6057.66 but there's still a lot more
work that needs to be done.
6060.54 My read of the data are that
6062.64 the more extensive clinical trials
6065.37 have not happened yet.
6066.42 The smaller studies that have happened
6069.3 revealed that some
patients do get some relief
6071.4 from ketamine therapy for OCD,
6073.5 but there was nothing
overwhelmingly pointing to the fact
6077.4 that ketamine is a magic
bullet for OCD treatment.
6081.57 So cannabis, CBD, at least now,
6084.42 even though it's one smaller study,
6086.58 there's no real evidence that it can
6089.16 alleviate OCD symptoms.
6091.74 If there are new studies published soon,
6093.27 I'll be sure to update you.
6094.62 And if you see those studies,
6095.73 please send them to me.
6096.563 Ketamine therapy, the jury is still out,
6098.91 psilocybin, The jury is still out.
6100.86 These are early days.
6102.45 Another treatment that's
becoming somewhat common,
6105.42 or at least people are
commonly excited about
6107.7 is transcranial magnetic stimulation.
6110.01 So this is the use of a magnetic coil.
6112.32 This is completely noninvasive,
6113.91 placed on one portion of the skull,
6117.03 and one can direct magnetic
6120.78 energy toward particular
areas of the brain
6123.15 to either suppress, or nowadays,
6124.95 you can also activate
particular brain regions.
6127.44 There are some interesting data
6128.49 showing that if TMS is applied
6130.47 to areas of the brain involved
6131.94 in the generation of motor action,
6134.01 so the so-called motor areas,
6135.75 or supplementary motor
areas as they're called,
6138.6 while people think about
or have intrusive thoughts,
6143.19 we know that the TMS coil can interrupt
6145.65 the motor behaviors, the
compulsive behaviors,
6149.13 and at least in a small cohort of studies
6152.536 and a small number of
patients within those studies,
6155.13 this has been shown to be effective,
6157.38 not just while the coil
is on the head, of course,
6159.45 but after the study has been performed
6161.97 or the treatment's been performed
6163.5 in reducing OCD symptoms
by disrupting the tendency
6167.85 for the compulsive behavior
to be so automatic.
6171.57 One of the key features of
obsessive-compulsive disorder
6174.81 is that, especially if it's
been around for a while,
6178.65 the person's been dealing
with it for a while,
6180.36 there isn't a pattern in
which the person thinks,
6183.42 oh, I have this contamination fear,
6185.97 or I need symmetry, or
I'm kind of obsessed
6188.37 to count to the number seven.
6189.72 And then they pause and they go,
6191.433 ooh, and then they do it.
6192.9 No, typically there's a very close
6195.66 pairing of the obsession
and the compulsion in time
6198.57 so that somebody's
walking down the street,
6199.95 thinking one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,
6201.18 one, two, three, four,
five, six seven, seven...
6203.31 and then they're doing this
6204.87 in such rapid succession
6207.15 because the obsessions
are coming up so quickly.
6209.43 Thoughts can be generated very quickly.
6211.68 And then they're
generating the compulsions
6212.943 as a way to beat down
6214.32 or to try and suppress that anxiety
6216.69 and then it comes right back up again
6218.1 at even stronger as I described earlier.
6220.41 So transcranial magnetic stimulation
6222.48 seems to intervene in these
various fast processes.
6226.11 Right now, I don't think it's fair to say
6228.3 that TMS is a magic bullet either.
6230.82 I think there's a lot
of excitement about TMS
6232.47 and in particular,
6233.94 I really want to nail this point home,
6235.89 in particular, there's excitement about
6238.59 the combination of TMS
with drug treatments,
6241.8 or the combination of TMS with
cognitive behavioral therapy.
6245.88 And this is a really important point,
6247.47 not just for sake of discussion
6248.7 about obsessive-compulsive disorder,
6250.23 but also depression, ADHD, schizophrenia,
6254.76 any number of different
psychiatric challenges
6257.76 and disorders in most cases
are going to respond best
6261.48 to a combination of behavioral treatment
6263.28 that's ongoing that
occurs in the laboratory
6265.41 and clinical setting,
6266.243 but also in the home setting
where there's homework,
6268.74 maybe even home visits.
6271.17 Drug treatments, often, not always,
6273.69 are a terrific augment to
6275.22 those cognitive behavioral therapies
6276.62 or other behavioral therapies.
6278.04 And then now we are living in the age
6280.05 of brain-machine interface.
6281.31 You have companies like Neuralink
6283.02 that I think it's fair
to say are going to enter
6285.63 the brain machine-interface world first
6288.21 through the treatment
of certain syndromes,
6291.96 movement syndromes or
psychiatric syndromes
6293.94 probably before they
start putting electrodes
6296.16 into the brain to
stimulate enhanced memory
6298.65 or enhanced cognition, who knows,
6300.06 I don't know exactly what they're doing
6301.83 behind the walls of Neuralink.
6302.937 But I have to imagine, in fact,
6304.56 I would wager maybe not both arms,
6306.81 but I'll wager my left arm
6308.34 that the first set of
FDA approved technologies
6313.38 to come out of companies like Neuralink
6315.96 are going to be those for
the treatment of things
6317.4 like Parkinson's and movement disorders
6319.2 and cognitive disorders, rather than,
6321.63 shall we say, kind of recreational
6324.03 cognitive enhancement
or things of that sort.
6326.1 So transcranial magnetic
stimulation is noninvasive.
6328.53 It doesn't involve going
down below the skull,
6330.9 can have some effect,
but most laboratories
6333.69 that I'm aware of at
Stanford and elsewhere
6336.21 that are exploring TMS for things like OCD
6338.4 and other types of psychiatric
6340.53 challenges are using TMS in combination
6343.83 with drug therapies, are using,
6345.66 in some cases, for instance,
6346.98 a laboratory at Stanford, hope
to get 'em on the podcast,
6349.71 a psychiatrist, Nolan Williams,
6351.78 is exploring TMS in combination with
6354.18 psychedelic therapies, not
necessarily at the same time,
6356.37 but nonetheless combining them
6357.89 or exploring how they
impact brain circuitry.
6360.51 So if you have OCD, should
you run out and get TMS,
6363.24 or should you try ketamine therapy,
6364.92 of course, with a licensed physician?
6366.42 I think it's too early to say yes.
6368.49 I think the answer is
we need to wait and see.
6371.4 I think cognitive behavioral
therapy, the SSRIs,
6373.527 and some other drug
treatments like neuroleptics
6376.47 combined with SSRIs and
cognitive behavioral therapy
6379.41 are where the real bulk of the data are.
6382.53 I want to make one additional
point about cannabis CBD
6385.17 as it relates to
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
6387.84 To me, it's not at all surprising
6390.21 that cannabis CBD did not
improve symptoms of OCD.
6394.35 Because in my discussion
with Dr. Paul Conti
6396.69 a few weeks ago,
6398.31 and I should mention, Dr. Conti
6399.48 is indeed a medical
doctor, a psychiatrist,
6403.08 we were talking about
cannabis and its various uses,
6405.27 because it does have some
clinical applications.
6408.27 And he mentioned that
one of the main effects
6410.82 of cannabis is to tighten focus
6414.63 and to enhance concentration on
6417.66 and thoughts about one particular thing.
6420.45 And in some cases that can
be clinically beneficial,
6423.12 and in other cases that can
be clinically detrimental.
6426.12 If you accept the idea that
cannabis increases focus,
6431.88 and you think about OCD
and the networks involved,
6435.87 and you think about the
anxiety and the relationship
6438.18 between the obsession and compulsion,
6440.88 well, then it shouldn't
come as any surprise
6442.68 that cannabis did not
improve the symptoms of OCD
6446.13 because if anything,
it would increase focus
6449.04 on the obsessions and the compulsions.
6450.87 Now that's not what they observed.
6451.95 They did not see an exacerbation
6453.96 or a worsening of the
symptoms of OCD with cannabis,
6457.38 at least that's not my read of the data,
6459.12 but they did not see an improvement
6461.1 in OCD symptoms with cannabis or CBD.
6464.13 And to me, that's not surprising
6466.11 given that cannabis CBD
seems to increase focus.
6469.56 Next, I'd like to talk
about some of the research
6471.63 on and the roles of hormones in OCD,
6475.11 because it turns out to be
6475.943 a very interesting relationship there.
6477.87 But before I do, I want
to point out something
6479.58 that I realize I probably
should have said earlier,
6482.49 which is one of the key
things for someone with OCD
6485.61 to come to understand if
they're going to experience
6488.19 any relief of their symptoms,
6489.81 whether or not they're
doing drug treatments
6490.98 or behavioral treatments or otherwise,
6492.99 is that thoughts are
not as bad as actions.
6498.72 Thoughts are not as bad as actions.
6500.76 One of the kind of rules
that people with OCD
6504.09 seem to adopt for themselves
6506.16 is that thoughts are really,
6508.53 truly the equivalent of actions.
6510.33 So they'll have an intrusive thought and,
6512.58 we haven't spent too
much time on this today,
6513.99 but earlier I touched on the fact
6515.97 that some of the intrusive
thoughts that people have
6518.28 in OCD are really disturbing.
6520.47 They can be really gross,
6522.18 or at least gross to that person.
6524.1 They can evoke imagery that
is toxic or infectious,
6529.05 or is highly sexualized in a way
6531.63 that is disturbing to
them, it can be very taboo.
6534.48 This is not uncommon
6536.13 when you start talking to people with OCD
6537.78 and you start pulling on the thread.
6539.49 Again, this would be a psychiatrist
6541.47 who was trained to ask the right questions
6543.63 and gain the comfort
and trust of a patient.
6545.91 And they start to reveal that
6546.743 these thoughts are really
intrusive and kind of disturbing,
6549.63 which is why they feel so compelled
6551.22 to try and suppress them with behaviors.
6553.38 One of the powerful elements
of treatment for OCD
6557.28 is to really support the patient
6560.49 and make them realize that
thoughts are just thoughts
6564.21 and that everyone has disturbing thoughts.
6566.55 And that oftentimes
those disturbing thoughts
6568.38 arise at the most
inconvenient, and sometimes,
6571.44 what seems like the most
inappropriate circumstances.
6575.01 And this relates to a
whole larger discussion
6577.35 that we could have about what are thoughts
6579.78 and why do they surface,
6580.62 and how come when you stand
at the edge of a bridge,
6583.53 even if you do not want to jump off,
6585.21 you think about jumping off.
6586.68 And this has to do with the fact
6588.45 that your nervous system,
as a prediction machine,
6590.85 is oftentimes testing possibilities.
6592.71 And sometimes that testing
goes way off into the
6596.91 Netherlands of the thought patterns
6600.54 and emotional patterns that
we all have inside of us.
6603.36 The big difference between
a thought and an action
6605.85 is that, of course, the nervous system is,
6608.87 in one case, not translating
6611.1 those patterns of thinking
into motor sequences.
6614.97 That nerdy way of saying
thoughts aren't actions,
6618.66 believe it or not,
6619.493 can be helpful for people if they really
6621.48 think about that and
use it as an opportunity
6623.73 to realize that, first of
all, they're not crazy.
6627.36 They're not thinking
and feeling this stuff
6630.3 because they're bad or evil.
6632.19 And of course, sometimes
this can cross over
6634.2 with other elements of life
6635.82 where we place moral judgment on people
6637.8 for certain behaviors.
6638.633 I think that's part of a
healthy society, of course,
6640.68 that's why we have laws and punishments
6642.63 and rewards for that matter
for certain types of behaviors.
6645.69 But this idea that thoughts
are not as bad as actions
6647.73 and that thoughts can be tolerated
6649.77 and the anxiety around thoughts
6651.66 can be tolerated and
over time can diminish,
6654.06 that's a very powerful hallmark theme
6656.31 of the treatment of OCD
6657.45 so I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.
6659.94 Thoughts are not actions.
6661.92 Actions can harm us, they
can harm other people,
6664.53 they can soak up enormous amounts of time.
6668.52 Thoughts can soak up
enormous amounts of time.
6670.92 They can be very troubling.
6671.94 They can be very detrimental.
6673.2 We of course want to be sensitive to that,
6675.81 but when it really comes down to it,
6678.81 the first step in treatment
for OCD is this realization
6682.83 where the approach to the realization
6684.51 that thoughts are not as bad as actions.
6687.3 So what about hormones in OCD?
6689.55 Well, this has been explored,
6690.75 albeit not as extensively
as I would've liked to find,
6693.66 but when I went into the literature,
6695.34 I found one particularly
interesting study,
6698.28 entitled, Neurosteroid Levels in Patients
6700.23 with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.
6702.18 First author, Erbay
6703.013 And as always, we'll
provide a link to the study.
6707.04 The objective of this
study was to explore serum
6709.56 within blood, neurosteroid
levels in people with OCD.
6713.73 Why?
6714.563 Well, because of the relationship
6715.86 between OCD and anxiety
6717.36 and the fact that in
stress-related disorders
6719.67 such as anxiety and depression,
6722.28 the hormones have been
extensively explored,
6724.14 but not so much in OCD,
at least until this study.
6726.78 So they compared serum levels of a number
6729.09 of different hormones,
progesterone, pregnenolone,
6731.58 DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone.
6735.36 This was done in 30 patients with OCD
6737.297 and 30 healthy controls.
6739.62 So it's not a huge study,
but it's enough to draw
6742.62 some pretty nice conclusions.
6744.0 These subjects were 18 to 49 years old,
6746.91 and the controls were age and sex matched
6750.33 healthy volunteers.
6751.2 Again, no OCD.
6752.85 What was the basic
takeaway from the study?
6754.26 The basic takeaway from the
study was that in females
6756.9 with OCD, there was evidence
6759.63 for significantly elevated
cortisol and DHEA.
6763.65 Now that's interesting because cortisol
6765.33 is well known to be associated
with the stress system.
6768.57 Although every day, should mention,
6770.67 we all, male or female,
everybody experiences
6774.3 an increase in cortisol
shortly after awakening.
6776.79 That's a healthy increase in cortisol.
6779.04 Late shift, I mean, late in
the day peaks in cortisol
6783.15 where a shift in that cortisol peak
6784.95 to later in the day is a known correlate
6789.33 of depression and anxiety disorders.
6792.66 So the fact that cortisol is elevated
6794.157 and DHEA are elevated in female patients
6798.42 with OCD suggests that
6801.75 cortisol is either reflective of or causal
6804.48 for the increase in anxiety.
6806.82 We don't know the
direction of that effect.
6808.92 Now in male patients with OCD,
6811.68 there was evidence for increased cortisol.
6813.81 Again, not surprising given the
role of anxiety in cortisol,
6816.86 or I should say, given the
role of cortisol in anxiety
6819.93 and the increasing anxiety seen in OCD,
6822.87 but there are also significant
reductions in testosterone,
6825.99 which should also not surprise us
6828.18 because cortisol and
testosterone more or less compete
6832.02 in some fashion for their own production,
6834.99 both are derived from
the molecule cholesterol.
6837.9 And there are certain biochemical pathways
6839.67 that can either direct
that cholesterol molecule
6841.86 toward cortisol synthesis
or testosterone synthesis,
6845.22 but not both.
6846.54 So they compete.
6847.373 So when cortisol goes up in general,
6849.06 not always, but in general,
6850.2 testosterone goes down and vice versa.
6852.57 If you want to learn more
about the relationship
6854.31 between cortisol and testosterone,
6855.81 and there are even some tools
to try and optimize those
6857.85 ratios in both males and females,
6860.4 you can find that in our episode
6861.69 on optimizing testosterone and estrogen,
6863.73 that's at hubermanlab.com.
6865.8 Now, I would say the
most interesting aspect
6868.44 of this study is not
that DHEA and cortisol
6871.8 are elevated in females with OCD
6873.2 or that cortisol and testosterone
6875.67 have this opposite effect,
6876.63 cortisol up and testosterone
down in males with OCD,
6880.11 but rather the relationship
between all of those,
6883.08 DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone.
6886.77 In terms of GABA, GABA again
6889.35 being this inhibitory neurotransmitter
6891.57 that tends to quiet
certain neuronal pathways,
6896.04 it does different things
at different synapses,
6898.83 but in general, the more
GABA that's present,
6901.17 the more inhibition that's present,
6902.79 and therefore the more
suppression of neural activity.
6905.52 And DHEA is known to
be a potent antagonist
6911.43 of the GABA system.
6913.47 So here we have elevated DHEA in females.
6918.54 And I should also
mention that testosterone
6921.09 is also known to tap into the GABA system.
6923.82 Typically, when testosterone is elevated,
6926.13 GABA transmission, at
least is slightly elevated.
6929.76 So here we have a situation
in which the pattern
6932.28 of hormones in females and males with OCD
6936.51 are different from those
in people without OCD
6940.77 such that GABA transmission is altered
6943.86 and the net effect would be
an overall reduction in GABA.
6947.64 Now GABA, as an inhibitory
neurotransmitter,
6951.39 and broadly speaking is associated
6953.67 with lower levels of anxiety,
6955.77 and it tends to create balance
6957.75 within various neural circuits.
6959.43 Now, that's a very broad statement,
6960.63 but we know for instance, in epilepsy,
6963.54 that GABA levels are reduced
6965.01 and therefore you get runaway excitation
6966.99 of certain circuits in the brain,
6968.34 and therefore seizures, either petite mal,
6970.74 mini seizures, or grand
mal, massive seizures,
6973.35 or even drop seizures where
people completely collapse
6975.69 to the floor in seizure.
6976.83 You may have seen this before.
6978.18 I certainly have, it's very dramatic
6979.95 and it actually is quite
debilitating for people
6983.01 because obviously they don't
know when these seizures
6984.66 are coming on most often, and then
6987.03 they can fall into a stove
or while driving, et cetera.
6989.91 So the situation with OCD is one in which,
6993.18 for whatever reason, we don't
know the direction of effect.
6997.53 Certain hormones are elevated in females
6999.51 and certain hormones are elevated in males
7001.28 and those hormones differ
between males and females,
7005.57 and yet they both funnel into a system
7008.09 where GABAergic or GABA
transmission in the brain
7011.21 is reduced because of this ability
7013.46 for those particular hormones
7014.9 to be antagonists to GABA,
7017.21 and as a consequence, there's
likely to be overall levels
7021.77 of increased excitation in
certain networks in the brain
7025.4 and that brings us back to this
7027.972 cortico-striatal-thalamic loop,
7029.84 this repetitive loop
that seems to reinforce,
7032.39 we can say reinforces
obsession, leads to anxiety,
7036.56 leads to compulsion, leads to
transient relief of anxiety,
7040.4 but then increase in anxiety,
increased obsession, anxiety,
7044.09 compulsion, anxiety,
compulsion, anxiety, compulsion,
7046.28 and so on and so forth.
7047.78 So I have not found
studies that have explored
7052.07 adjusting testosterone levels
7054.38 through exogenous administration,
7056.09 cream or injection or otherwise,
7057.65 or that have focused on
reducing DHEA in females.
7062.24 If anyone is aware of such studies,
7063.83 please put them in the
comment section on YouTube
7066.86 or send them to us.
7067.85 We have a contact site on the
website at hubermanlab.com,
7070.64 but the comment section
on YouTube would be best.
7073.28 But because we know that
hormones impact neuromodulators
7076.22 and neurotransmitters,
as I just described,
7078.05 and that those neuromodulators
and neurotransmitters
7080.12 play an intimate role in the generation
7082.22 and the treatment of things like OCD,
7085.34 it stands to reason that manipulations
7088.34 of those hormone systems, however subtle
7090.56 or dramatic might, I want to highlight,
7092.9 might prove useful in
adjusting the symptoms of OCD
7096.23 and I hope that this is
an area that researchers
7099.23 are going to pursue in
the very near future
7100.94 because many of the
treatments for reducing DHEA
7104.57 or increasing testosterone
or reducing cortisol
7107.09 have already made it through FDA approval.
7109.91 They're out there, they're
readily prescribed.
7112.4 Many of them are already in generic form
7114.02 which means that the
patents have already lapsed
7116.42 on the first versions of those drugs.
7119.21 So when they're available as
generic drugs, very often,
7122.03 they're available at
significantly lower cost.
7124.7 There's a whole discussion we had there
7126.05 about patent laws and prescription drugs.
7129.47 But because these drugs
are largely available
7132.14 in prescription yet generic form,
7135.74 I think there's a great opportunity
7137.06 to explore how hormones,
not just cortisol,
7140.6 testosterone, and DHA,
7141.77 but the huge category of hormones
7144.14 might impact the symptoms of OCD,
7146.51 especially since many
of the symptoms of OCD
7149.21 show up right around the time of puberty.
7151.25 We haven't talked a lot
about childhood OCD,
7152.69 'cause we're going to do an entire series
7154.7 on childhood psychiatric
disorders and challenges but
7159.26 many children develop OCD early as young
7162.38 as three or four, believe it or not,
7164.27 or even 6 or 7 and 10
7166.04 and in adolescence, and
certainly around puberty.
7168.86 and in young adulthood.
7170.54 It is rare, although it does happen,
7172.58 that people will develop
OCD very late in life
7174.98 around 40 or older, just
kind of spontaneously.
7177.74 Most often when you look
at their clinical history,
7179.6 you find that either they were hiding it
7181.58 or is being suppressed in some way,
7183.32 or if it does spontaneously
show up late in life
7186.14 like mid-thirties or in one's forties,
7190.07 typically there's a
traumatic brain injury,
7192.53 could be due to stroke or
physical injury to the head
7195.26 or something of that sort.
7197.15 Nonetheless,
7198.74 there is a interesting correlation
7200.63 between the onset of puberty
in certain forms of OCD.
7203.33 There's certain forms of, or I should say,
7205.4 there's certain aspects of menopause
7206.84 that can relate to OCD.
7208.16 You can find all these
things in the literature.
7210.26 All this to say that hormones
impact neurotransmitters
7213.17 and neuromodulators, which clearly impact
7215.06 the kinds of circuits
that are involved in OCD
7217.22 and it makes sense that,
7219.14 and I would hope that there
would be an exploration
7221.63 of how these hormones impact OCD
7223.4 in the not too distant future.
7224.75 Now there is an extensive
literature exploring
7226.58 how testosterone therapy,
7227.96 both in males and
females, can be effective
7232.43 in some cases in the treatment
7234.44 of anxiety-related disorders,
7236.57 but not, at least to my
knowledge, in OCD in particular.
7240.14 So this whole area of the use
7242.33 of testosterone and estrogen therapies,
7244.28 DHEA, cortisol suppression,
7246.29 or maybe even enhancement
for the treatment of OCD
7249.89 is essentially a big black box
7252.35 that very soon, I believe, will be lit.
7256.55 I realize that a number of
listeners of this podcast
7258.92 are probably interested in the non-typical
7262.58 or holistic treatments for OCD.
7265.55 Dr. Blair Simpson's lab
has at least one study
7267.92 exploring the role of
mindfulness meditation
7271.4 for the treatment of OCD.
7274.31 There, the data are a
little bit complicated
7277.34 and I should mention that
7279.98 good things are happening, at
least in the United States,
7282.68 probably elsewhere as well,
7284.06 but good things are happening in terms of
7286.43 the exploration of things like meditation
7289.1 and other, let's call them non-traditional
7291.14 or holistic forms of treatment
for psychiatric disorders
7294.68 because of the division
of complimentary health
7297.23 that's now been launched
7298.37 by the National Institutes of Health.
7299.63 So, whereas before
people would think about
7302.69 meditation or yoga nidra,
7304.97 or even CBD supplementation
for that matter,
7308.69 as kind of fringe maybe, or kind of woo
7310.91 or non-traditional at the very least,
7313.67 the National Institutes of
Health in the United States
7315.68 has now devoted an entire division,
7319.25 an entire Institute,
purely for the exploration
7322.4 of things like breathing
practices, meditation, et cetera.
7324.74 So there's a cancer institute,
7326.15 there's a hearing and deafness institute,
7327.86 there's a vision institute,
7329.57 and now there's this
complimentary health Institute,
7331.58 which I think is a wonderful addition
7334.61 to the more traditional
aspects of medicine.
7338.0 I think no possible useful treatment
7341.09 should be overlooked or
unresearched in my opinion,
7343.7 provided that can be done safely.
7345.83 And as I mentioned,
Dr. Blair Simpson's lab
7348.65 has looked at the role
of mindfulness meditation
7351.347 and the treatment of OCD.
7353.33 Now we should all keep in mind,
7356.12 no pun intended, that most of the data
7358.4 on mindfulness meditation
shows that it increases
7361.97 the ability to focus.
7363.86 Now, this brings us back to a
kind of repeating theme today,
7366.44 which is that increased focus
7368.06 may not be the best thing
for somebody with OCD
7371.87 because it might increase
focus on the obsession
7375.2 and/or compulsion.
7377.03 Turns out that mindfulness
meditation can be useful
7379.7 in the treatment of OCD,
7380.99 but mainly by way of how it impacts
7384.05 the focus on and the ability
7387.11 to engage in cognitive
behavioral therapies.
7390.05 So it's very unlikely, at
least by my read of the data,
7393.29 to be a direct effect of meditation
7395.54 on relieving the symptoms,
7396.68 rather it seems that
meditation is increasing focus
7399.53 on things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework
7403.04 and to not focus on other things
7404.72 and therefore indirectly
improving the symptoms of OCD.
7408.11 Now somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,
7409.94 there have also been a fairly
large number of studies
7412.64 exploring how nutraceuticals,
as they're sometimes called,
7416.48 supplements that are
available over the counter
7418.64 can impact the treatment of
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
7421.73 Now there's such an extensive
number of different compounds
7425.0 and supplements that
fall under the category
7427.31 of nutraceuticals and
that have been explored
7429.29 in the treatment of OCD
that I'd like to point you
7431.12 to a review that is entitled,
7433.67 Nutraceuticals in the treatment
7434.96 of obsessive-compulsive
disorder: a review,
7437.69 excuse me, of mechanistic
and clinical evidence.
7440.51 So it's published in 2011,
so it's over 10-years-old.
7444.5 And so by now,
7445.953 I have to imagine that
there are an enormous number
7448.46 of additional substances
that could be explored,
7451.43 but there are just one or two
here that I want to focus on.
7454.4 Here in this review,
7455.233 they describe effects
of 5-HTP and tryptophan,
7458.99 so things that are in
the serotonin pathway,
7461.06 which would make sense
7461.893 given what we know about the SSRIs
7463.91 that people would explore
how different supplements
7466.04 that increase serotonergic transmission
7468.29 might impact OCD.
7470.36 What you find is that they
do have significant effects
7473.0 in improving or reducing
the symptoms of OCD
7476.72 in somewhat similar way
to some of the SSRIs.
7479.45 But you of course have to be careful.
7482.54 Anything that's going to tap into a given
7484.55 neurochemical system to the same degree
7486.86 may very likely have the
same sorts of side effects
7490.16 that a prescription drug would.
7491.66 One compound that I like to focus on
7493.24 in a little more depth, however,
7494.75 because it's exciting
and interesting to me
7497.45 is inositol.
7499.28 Inositol is a compound that
we are going to talk about
7501.41 in several future podcasts, because,
7503.75 well, first of all,
7505.07 it seems that it can
have impressive effects
7507.44 on reducing anxiety.
7509.03 It also can have pretty impressive effects
7510.59 in improving fertility
and particular in women
7513.38 with polycystic ovarian syndrome.
7515.87 And here I'm referring
specifically to myo-inositol
7518.57 because it comes in several forms.
7520.16 And it does appear that
900 milligrams of inositol
7523.79 can improve sleep and can reduce anxiety
7526.97 perhaps when taken at that
dosage or higher dosages.
7530.24 I will just confess, first
of all, I don't have OCD,
7533.27 although I will also confess
that when I was a child,
7535.52 I had a transient tick.
7537.2 I've talked about this on podcast before.
7539.12 It was a grunting tick.
7540.14 So when I was about six or seven,
7541.49 I recall a trip to
Washington DC with my family,
7544.76 where I was feeling a strong
7548.69 desire or need even as I recall,
7551.51 to grunt in order to clear something
7553.79 in my throat, but I didn't
have anything in my throat.
7556.19 I didn't have a cold
or any postnasal drip,
7558.11 it was really just the feeling
that I needed to do that,
7560.12 to release some sort of tension.
7562.37 And I remember my dad at the time
7565.1 telling me don't do that.
7566.24 Don't do that, it's not good to grunt
7567.92 or something like that.
7568.753 I think he saw that it was a
kind of compulsive behavior.
7571.16 And so I would actually
hide in the back seat
7572.9 of the rental car and do
it, or I'd hide in my room.
7575.33 Fortunately for me, it was transient,
7577.04 I think about six months or
a year later, it disappeared.
7579.71 Although I did notice, actually
an ex-girlfriend of mine
7582.8 point out that when I get very tired
7584.54 and I've been working very long hours,
7586.07 sometimes that grunting
tick will reappear.
7588.62 What does that mean?
7589.46 Do I have Tourette's?
7590.36 I don't know, maybe.
7591.56 I was never diagnosed with Tourette's.
7592.79 Do I have OCD? Maybe.
7595.46 I certainly could be accused
7596.78 of having obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder,
7599.36 which we'll talk about
still in a few minutes.
7602.42 But the point here is that many children
7605.24 transiently express ticks
or low level Tourette's
7608.69 or OCD, and again, transiently
7610.7 and it disappears over time.
7612.68 So inositol has been explored
7614.84 in a bunch of different contexts,
7616.28 including for ticks in OCD, et cetera.
7619.82 Going back to inositol
and its current use,
7623.33 or I should say my current use,
7624.38 I've been taking 900
milligrams of inositol
7627.26 as in addition to my
existing toolkit for sleep,
7630.71 which I've talked about
many times on this podcast
7633.29 and other podcasts, consists
7635.03 of magnesium threonate,
apigenin, and theanine.
7638.3 If you want to know more about that kit,
7639.71 you can go to our newsletter,
Neural Network Newsletter
7641.88 at hubermanlab.com.
7643.61 The toolkit for sleep is there.
7644.84 You don't even have to
sign up for the newsletter
7646.52 but it'll give you a flavor
of the sorts of things
7647.93 that are in the newsletter.
7649.07 In any case, I've been experimenting a bit
7653.0 with taking 900 milligrams of myo-inositol
7655.55 either alone or combination
with that sleep kit.
7657.65 And I must say the sleep I've been getting
7659.09 on inositol is extremely deep
7662.42 and does seem to lead to enhanced levels
7664.49 of focus and alertness during the day.
7666.05 And perhaps you're noticing that
7666.95 'cause I'm talking more quickly
7667.85 on this podcast than in previous podcast.
7669.47 No, I'm just kidding.
7670.303 I don't think the two things relate
7671.42 in any kind of causal way.
7673.4 The point here is that inositol is known
7676.43 to be pretty effective
in reducing anxiety,
7679.4 but when taken at very high dosages.
7681.38 Can it do the same at low dosages?
7683.15 We don't know.
7683.983 I would consider 900
milligrams a low dose.
7686.63 Most of this, given the fact
7688.79 that most of the studies of inositol
7691.82 have explored very high dosages,
7693.44 like even 10 or 12 grams per day,
7696.38 which I must say seems exceedingly high
7698.78 and they do report that
some of the subjects
7700.52 in those experiments actually stop taking
7702.77 the inositol because of gastric discomfort
7705.02 or gastric distress as it's called.
7707.57 So I've reported my results with sleep
7710.123 in a kind of anecdotal way.
7712.22 They certainly aren't
peer-reviewed studies
7713.57 that I described about my own experience
7715.67 in an anecdotal way.
7716.9 But nonetheless, it's been explored that
7720.32 things like glycine, which is another,
7722.75 which is an amino acid,
7723.83 which also acts as an
inhibitory neurotransmitter
7725.81 in the brain, taken at very high dosages,
7727.64 60 grams per day, that is a absolutely
7730.82 astonishingly high amount of glycine.
7732.86 I would not recommend
taking that much glycine
7735.11 unless you're part of a study
7736.4 where they tell you to
and you know it's safe.
7738.98 18 grams, excuse me, of an inositol,
7741.98 these are very, very high
dosages used in these studies.
7744.74 Nonetheless, there's some interesting data
7746.96 about inositol leading to
7750.41 some alleviation of OCD symptoms
7753.62 or partial alleviation of OCD symptoms
7756.56 in as little as two weeks after initiating
7760.4 the supplement protocol.
7761.78 So I think there's a great
future for these nutraceuticals,
7764.03 meaning I think more
systematic exploration
7766.07 in particular of lower dosages
7767.39 in the context of OCD treatment.
7769.85 And as we saw before for the SSRIs
7773.78 and other prescription drug treatments,
7775.61 I think there really
needs to be an exploration
7777.71 of these nutraceuticals in combination
7779.66 with behavioral therapies.
7780.74 And who knows, maybe with
brain machine interface
7782.51 like cranial magnetic stimulation as well.
7785.24 Now way back at the
beginning of the episode,
7787.16 I alluded to the fact
that OCD is one thing,
7790.43 obsessive-compulsive disorder,
7791.72 and it's truly a disorder
and it's truly debilitating
7794.09 and it's extremely common,
7796.58 and then there's this other thing
7798.02 called obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder,
7800.42 which is distinct from that
7801.95 does not have the intrusive component
7805.04 so people don't feel overwhelmed
7806.63 or overtaken by these thoughts,
7809.66 rather, they find that the obsessions
7812.51 can sometimes serve them
or they even welcome them.
7815.848 And I think many of us
know people like this,
7817.7 I perhaps even could be
accused or who knows,
7820.16 maybe have been accused of having
7821.57 an obsessive-compulsive
personality at times.
7825.05 Why do I draw this distinction?
7826.25 Well, first of all, we've come
to a point in human history,
7830.03 I think in large part
because of social media
7832.61 but also in large part
7833.45 because there are a number
of discussions being held
7836.3 about mental health that have
brought terms like trauma,
7840.5 depression, OCD, et cetera,
7843.44 into the common vernacular
7845.93 so that people will
say, ah, you're so OCD,
7848.84 or someone will say I
was traumatized by that,
7850.96 or I was traumatized by this.
7853.07 We should be very careful, right?
7854.48 I'm certainly not the word police,
7856.79 but we should be very careful in the use
7859.67 of certain types of language,
7861.59 especially language that
has real psychiatric
7865.19 and psychological definitions
7867.8 because it can really draw us off course
7869.78 in providing relief for
some of these syndromes.
7871.94 For instance,
7874.04 the word trauma is thrown
around left and right nowadays.
7876.53 I was traumatized by this,
or that caused trauma,
7878.69 you're giving me trauma.
7880.55 Listen, I realize that many people
7883.16 are traumatized by certain events
7884.9 including things that are said to them,
7886.64 I absolutely acknowledge that,
7887.99 hence our episodes on
trauma and trauma treatment,
7891.08 several of them, in fact.
7892.97 Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
7895.94 and then dedicated solo episodes
7898.19 with just me blabbing about
trauma and trauma treatment.
7901.67 But as Dr. Conti so
appropriately pointed out,
7905.93 trauma is really something that changes
7908.78 our neural circuitry and
therefore our thoughts
7911.9 and our behaviors in a very persistent way
7914.18 that is detrimental to us.
7915.53 Not every bad event is traumatizing,
7917.63 not everything that we
dislike or even that we hate
7919.88 or that feels terrible
to us is traumatizing.
7922.07 For something to reach
the level of trauma,
7924.89 it really needs to change
our neural circuitry
7927.71 and therefore our
thoughts and our behaviors
7929.66 in a persistent way that
is maladaptive for us.
7932.6 Similarly, just calling
someone obsessive is one thing,
7937.19 saying that someone has
OCD or assuming one has OCD
7940.1 simply because they have a
personality or a phenotype,
7943.01 as we say, where they need
things in perfect order,
7945.29 like I find myself correcting these pens
7947.09 making sure that the caps are facing
7949.49 in the same direction
for instance right now,
7952.64 that is not the same as OCD.
7955.28 If, for instance, I
can tolerate these pens
7957.2 being at different orientation
7958.46 or even throw the cap on
the floor or something,
7960.23 it doesn't create a lot of anxiety for me.
7962.06 I confess, I agree it's a
little bit in the moment,
7964.19 but then I can forget
about it and move on.
7965.99 That's one of the key distinctions
7967.73 between obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder
7970.64 and obsessive-compulsive disorder
7973.07 in its strictest form.
7974.87 Now, once one hears that OCD
7976.94 is different than obsessive-compulsive
7978.29 personality disorder
because of this difference
7981.08 in how intrusive the thoughts are or not,
7983.72 then that's useful, but
it really doesn't tell us
7986.78 anything about what is
happening mechanistically
7989.42 in one situation or another.
7991.55 Fortunately, there are
beautiful data again
7994.07 from Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.
7995.75 And you can tell based
on the number of studies
7997.97 that I've referred to from her laboratory,
7999.77 she's truly one of the
luminaries in this field,
8002.92 that there really are some
fundamental wiring differences
8006.79 and behavioral differences
and psychological differences
8009.58 between people who have
obsessive-compulsive disorder
8012.43 and those who have obsessive-compulsive
8014.23 personality disorder.
8016.45 So this is a study, first
author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O
8019.99 entitled, Capacity to
delay reward differentiates
8022.93 obsessive-compulsive disorder
8024.28 and obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.
8027.28 And the methods in this
study were to take 25 people
8030.07 with OCD and 25 people
with obsessive-compulsive
8033.79 personality disorder and 25 people
8036.34 who have both, because it
is possible to have both
8038.89 and that's important to point out,
8039.94 and 25 so-called healthy controls,
8042.04 people that don't have
obsessive-compulsive
8043.72 personality disorder or
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
8047.2 They take clinical assessments
8048.76 and then they took a number of tests
8051.22 that probed their ability
to defer gratification,
8055.72 something called, in the laboratory,
8057.07 we call it delayed discounting.
8058.6 So their ability to defer gratification
8062.23 through a task where they
can either accept reward
8064.78 right away or accept reward later.
8066.43 Some of you may have heard
of the two marshmallow task.
8068.89 This is based on a study
that was performed years ago
8071.62 on young children at
Stanford and elsewhere
8073.75 where they take young
children into a room,
8076.18 they offer them a marshmallow,
8079.18 kids like marshmallows generally,
8081.28 and you say, you can eat
the marshmallow right now
8084.28 or you can wait some period of time,
8086.44 and if you are able to wait
and not eat the marshmallow,
8089.38 you can have two marshmallows.
8090.97 And in general, children
want two marshmallows
8093.19 more than they want one marshmallow.
8094.69 So really what you're probing is
8096.37 their ability to access
delayed gratification.
8099.04 And they're very entertaining,
8101.56 even truly amusing videos
of this on the internet.
8106.81 So if you just do two
marshmallow task video
8109.48 and you go into YouTube,
8110.313 what you'll find is that
the children will use
8112.27 all sorts of strategies
to delay gratification.
8116.14 Some of the kids will
cover the marshmallow.
8118.75 Others will talk to the
marshmallow and say,
8120.4 I know you're not that delicious.
8121.69 You look delicious, but
no, you're not delicious.
8123.43 They'll engage with the marshmallow
8124.53 in all sorts of cute ways.
8125.77 They'll turn around and try
to, you know, avoidance,
8127.96 which actually speaks to a
whole category of behaviors
8130.99 that people with OCD also use.
8132.61 I'm not saying these kids had OCD,
8134.23 but avoidance behaviors are
very much a component of OCD.
8138.67 People really trying to avoid the thing
8140.44 that evokes the obsession.
8143.44 Well some kids are able
to delay gratification,
8146.44 some aren't and it's
debatable as to whether or not
8148.69 the kids that are able
to delay gratification
8150.52 go on to have more
successful lives or not.
8152.38 Initially, that was the
conclusion of those studies.
8154.18 There's still a lot of debate about it,
8155.41 we'll bring an expert on to
give us the final conclusion
8157.87 on this 'cause there is one
and it's very interesting
8159.7 and not intuitive.
8161.05 Nonetheless, adults are also faced
8163.6 with decisions every day, all day
8165.88 as to whether or not they
can delay gratification.
8168.88 And this study used a, not
a two marshmallow task,
8173.41 but a game that involved rewards
8176.23 where people could delay in order
8177.67 to get greater rewards later.
8179.32 What is the conclusion?
8180.67 Well, first of all, obsessive-compulsive
8183.04 and obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects
8186.04 both showed impairments in
their psychosocial functioning
8190.72 and quality of life.
8191.86 They had compulsive behavior.
8194.26 So these are people that
are suffering in their life
8196.33 because their compulsions
are really strong.
8199.09 So it's not just being really nit-picky
8201.31 or really orderly in one case
8202.63 and having full blown OCD in the other,
8204.16 both sets of subjects
are challenged in life
8207.34 because they're having relationship issues
8209.14 or job-related issues, et cetera,
8210.7 because they are that compulsive.
8213.37 However, the individuals with
8215.53 obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,
8218.56 they discounted the value
of delayed gratification
8221.95 significantly less than those
8223.3 with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
8226.27 What do I mean?
8227.44 They are both impairing disorders
8229.06 that are marked by compulsive behaviors,
8230.59 here I'm paraphrasing,
8232.21 but they can be
differentiated by the presence
8234.16 of obsessions in OCD.
8235.51 So obsessions in OCD.
8237.43 People with OCD are absolutely fixated
8241.63 on certain ideas and
those ideas are intrusive.
8244.3 Again, that's the hallmark theme.
8246.19 And by an excessive
capacity to delay reward
8249.22 in obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.
8251.47 That is people who have
obsessive-compulsive
8253.78 personality disorder are really good
8256.45 at delaying gratification.
8258.22 So they are able to
concentrate very intensely
8261.67 and perform very intensely in ways
8264.31 that allow them to instill order
8267.22 such that they can delay reward.
8269.32 Now you can see why this
contour of symptoms,
8274.54 meaning that the people with OCD
8278.2 are experiencing intrusive thoughts,
8280.93 whereas the people with
obsessive-compulsive
8283.06 personality disorder
show an enhanced ability
8286.18 to defer gratification.
8290.11 You could see how that would lead
8291.37 to very different outcomes.
8292.81 People with obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder
8295.57 can actually leverage
that personality disorder
8298.63 to perform better in
certain domains of life,
8301.09 not all domains of life,
8302.23 because remember, again,
8303.07 these people are in this study
8305.38 and they're showing up as
experiencing challenges in life
8308.26 because of their obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.
8311.41 Nonetheless, people with
obsessive-compulsive
8313.84 personality disorder, you could imagine,
8315.31 would be very good at say architecture
8319.09 or anything that involves
instilling a ton of order.
8321.67 Maybe sushi chef, for instance,
maybe a chef in general.
8324.82 I know chefs that just
kind of throw things around
8326.8 like the chef on the Muppets
and just like throw things
8330.1 everywhere and still produce amazing food.
8331.54 And then there's some people
there incredibly exacting,
8334.27 they're just incredibly precise.
8335.83 I think that movie, what is it?
8336.91 Jiro Dreams of Sushi?
8338.44 That movie is incredible.
8340.39 Certainly not saying he
has obsessive-compulsive
8342.19 personality disorder, but
I think it's fair to say
8344.35 that he is obsessive or
extremely meticulous and orderly
8349.18 about everything from start to finish.
8350.95 You can imagine a huge array
of different occupations
8353.77 and life endeavors where
this would be beneficial,
8356.38 science being one of them
where data collection
8358.51 and analysis is exceedingly
important that one be precise,
8362.05 or mathematics or physics or engineering,
8365.71 anything where precision has a payoff
8367.99 and gaining precision takes time and delay
8372.1 of immediate gratification,
8374.2 you can imagine that obsessive-compulsive
8375.79 personality disorder would synergize well
8378.07 with those sorts of
activities and professions.
8380.23 Whereas obsessive-compulsive
disorder is really intrusive.
8383.14 It's preventing functionality in many
8386.14 different domains of life.
8387.73 So the key takeaway here is that
8391.33 when we use the words
obsessive-compulsive,
8393.73 or we call someone obsessive-compulsive,
8395.53 or we are trying to
evaluate whether or not
8397.24 we are obsessive compulsive,
8398.5 it's very important that we highlight
8402.22 that obsessive compulsive
disorder is very intrusive.
8405.52 It involves intrusive thoughts
8406.78 and it interrupts with
normal functioning in life.
8409.12 Whereas obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder,
8411.49 while it can interrupt
normal functioning in life,
8414.28 it also can be productive.
8416.59 It can enhance functioning
in life, not just in work,
8419.08 but perhaps at home as well.
8421.12 If you are somebody and
you have family members
8423.43 that really place enormous value on having
8425.26 a beautiful and highly organized home,
8427.6 well, then it could lend
itself well to that.
8429.94 it's going to be a matter
of degrees, of course.
8431.62 None of these things is an absolute,
8433.15 it's going to be on a continuum,
8434.32 but I think it is fair to
say that obsessive-compulsive
8436.69 disorder, whether or
not in mild, moderate,
8439.12 or severe form is impairing
normal functioning,
8443.41 whereas obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder,
8445.93 there's a range of expressions of that,
8448.27 some of which can be adaptive,
8449.59 some of which can be maladaptive,
8451.03 and again, it's all going
to depend on context.
8453.67 Before we conclude, I do
want to touch on something
8456.61 that I think a lot of people experience
8458.53 and that's superstitions.
8460.6 Superstitions are fascinating,
8462.07 and there's some fascinating
research on superstitions.
8465.64 One particular study that I'm a big fan of
8468.64 is the work of Bence Olveczky at Harvard.
8471.25 He studies motor sequences
and motor learning,
8474.55 and he has beautiful
data on how people learn,
8477.52 for instance, a tennis swing
8479.5 and the patterns that
they engage in early on
8483.16 and then the patterns
of swinging that they,
8485.29 swinging the racket that is,
8486.64 that they engage in later
as they acquire more skill.
8489.73 And basically the takeaway is that
8491.71 the amount of error or
variation from swing to swing
8494.86 is dramatically reduced
as they acquire skill.
8499.15 That's all fine and good,
8501.34 and there's some
beautiful mechanistic data
8503.62 that he and others have discovered
8506.14 to support how that comes to be,
8508.24 but they also explore animal models,
8510.94 in particular, rats pressing
sequences of buttons
8514.87 and levers to obtain a reward.
8517.33 Believe it or not, rats are pretty smart.
8519.52 I've seen this with my own eyes.
8520.96 You can teach a rat to press
a lever for a pellet of food.
8524.47 Rats can also learn to press levers
8527.35 in a particular sequence in order to gain
8530.14 a piece of food.
8531.31 And they can actually learn to press
8534.4 an enormous number of levers
in very particular sequences
8537.28 in order to obtain pellets of food.
8539.2 You can also give them
little buttons to press
8541.57 or even a paddle to, or I
should say a pedal, excuse me,
8545.92 to stomp on with their foot
8547.39 in order to obtain a pellet of food.
8549.19 Basically rats can learn
exactly what they need to do
8552.1 in order to obtain a piece of food,
8554.77 especially if they're made
8555.67 a little bit hungry first.
8557.59 Bence's lab has published beautiful data
8560.08 showing that as animals and humans
8563.65 come to learn a particular motor sequence,
8565.78 very often they will
introduce motor patterns
8569.08 in that sequence that are
irrelevant to the outcome
8572.86 and yet that persist.
8574.6 If you've ever watched a game of baseball,
8576.19 you've seen this before.
8578.08 Oftentimes the pitcher
up on the mound will
8581.74 bring the ball to their chin.
8583.96 They'll look over their shoulder,
8585.55 they'll look back over the other shoulder,
8587.83 and then they will, of course,
reel back and pitch the ball.
8591.79 But if you watch closely,
8593.02 oftentimes there are components
in the motor sequence,
8595.48 which are completely
unrelated to the pitch.
8598.0 They're not looking necessarily to see
8599.65 if someone's stealing a base.
8601.15 They're not necessarily looking
8603.19 down at home plate where the batter is.
8606.01 They're also doing things like
8607.6 touching the back of their ear
8608.68 before they bring the ball to their chin
8610.51 or adjusting their hat.
8611.65 And if you watch individual pictures,
8613.27 what you'll find is that
they'll do the same sequence
8615.31 of completely irrelevant motor patterns
8618.31 before each and every single pitch.
8620.59 Similarly, rats that have
been trained to, for instance,
8623.86 hit two levers and step on a pedal
8627.07 with their left hind foot, and then
8630.7 tap a button up above
that is the red button,
8633.22 will do that to gain a piece of food.
8635.68 But sometimes they'll
also introduce a pattern
8637.72 into that motor sequence where they will
8640.51 shake their tail a little bit,
8641.68 or they'll turn their head a little bit,
8642.82 or they'll move their ears
a little bit, et cetera.
8645.67 Motor patterns that have nothing to do
8647.44 with obtaining the
particular outcome in mind.
8650.98 In other words, you could eliminate
8652.78 certain components of the motor sequence
8654.43 and it would not matter, the
rat would still get the pellet,
8656.62 the pitcher would still be able to pitch,
8659.56 and yet that get
introduced because somehow
8662.77 because they were
performed again and again
8665.71 prior to successful trials,
8668.83 the rat or the human baseball pitcher
8672.43 comes to believe in some way
8674.47 that it was involved in
generating the outcome,
8677.2 hence superstition, right?
8679.12 I confess I have a few superstitions.
8681.4 I occasionally will knock on wood.
8683.47 I'll say something that I want to happen,
8685.03 and I'll say, oh, knock on
wood, and I'll just do it.
8687.1 And occasionally I'll
challenge myself and think,
8689.65 ah, I don't want to knock,
don't knock on wood,
8691.45 Andrew, don't do that.
8693.31 I don't think anyone
wants to be superstitious,
8695.35 I certainly don't.
8696.25 And so every once in a while,
8697.21 I'll just challenge it, and I
won't actually knock on wood.
8700.9 I'm admitting this to you to kind of
8703.75 I guess normalize some of this.
8705.49 Some people have superstitions
8708.28 that border on or even become compulsions.
8712.03 They really come to believe
8713.32 that if they don't knock on wood,
8714.94 that something terrible
is going to happen,
8716.35 maybe something in particular.
8718.24 Or in the case of the baseball pitcher,
8719.89 they come to believe
that if they don't touch
8721.63 their right ear before they
reel back on the pitch,
8725.71 that the pitch won't be any good
8727.87 or that they're going to lose the game.
8729.13 Well, I don't know what
their thought process is.
8730.57 Now, I also don't know
what the rat is thinking,
8732.76 but the rat is clearly doing something
8736.21 or thinking something is
related to the final outcome.
8740.05 I don't know of any studies
where they've intervened
8742.27 with the particular
superstition-like behaviors
8745.57 of the rat to see whether or not the rat
8747.73 somehow doesn't continue
to do the motor sequence
8750.76 to get the pellet.
8751.593 We don't know the rats, they're rats.
8752.71 I don't speak rat, most people don't,
8754.3 or if you speak to a rat,
8755.65 if it speaks back, it's not in English.
8757.21 Anyway, the point is that
superstitions are beliefs
8761.5 that we, on an individual
scale, come to believe
8766.81 are linked to the
probability of an outcome
8769.51 when in fact we know, we actually know
8772.87 in our rational minds, they
have no real relationship
8776.2 to the outcome.
8778.06 Superstitions can become full-blown
8780.19 compulsions and obsessions
8782.8 when we repeat them often enough
8785.2 that they become automatic.
8786.58 And I think this is what
we observe most of the time
8788.89 when we see a pitcher touching their ear,
8791.41 or for instance, in
tennis, you see this a lot,
8793.72 you'll see someone
they'll slap their shoes.
8796.6 Often, I see this, they'll like slap
8798.04 the undersides of their soles.
8799.57 They may tell themselves
that this is, I don't know,
8801.7 maybe moving out some
of the dust or something
8803.56 in the bottoms of their soles,
8804.55 that gives them more
traction and they want that
8806.56 to be ready for the serve
or something like that.
8808.93 And maybe there's some truth to that,
8810.34 but here, what we're referring to
8812.377 are behaviors that really
have no rational relationship
8815.47 to the outcome, and yet we
perform in a compulsive way.
8819.61 People with OCD, yes, tend
to have more superstitions.
8823.36 People with more superstitions, yes,
8825.55 tend to have a tendency towards OCD
8828.547 and I should mention, obsessive-compulsive
8830.74 personality disorder.
8832.15 If you think way back to the
first part of this episode,
8835.78 when I was just describing
what the brain does, right?
8838.0 What does your brain do?
8838.833 Housekeeping functions to keep you alive
8840.7 and it's a prediction machine.
8842.98 Your neural circuits, you,
8845.32 have an enormous amount
of biological investment
8848.41 of real estate, literally,
cells and chemicals
8850.63 that are there to try and
make your world predictable
8854.53 and to try and give you control,
8856.57 or at least the sense of
control over that world
8859.39 and that's a normal process.
8862.33 Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions
8865.9 represent a kind of a
healthy range, I would say,
8870.13 of behaviors that are aimed
at generating predictability
8875.11 that don't disrupt normal function.
8877.24 Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,
8879.22 provided is not too severe,
8880.42 would I think represent the next level
8882.58 along that continuum.
8884.44 And then obsessive-compulsive disorder,
8886.33 as I pointed out earlier,
8887.74 is really a case of highly debilitating,
8890.05 highly intrusive, really
overtake of neural circuitry
8894.22 over our thoughts and behaviors
8895.57 that requires very
dedicated, very persistent,
8899.83 and very effective
treatments in order to stop
8903.82 those obsessions and compulsions
8905.2 and the anxiety that links them
8907.6 somewhat counterintuitively
by teaching people
8910.57 to tolerate that level
of increased anxiety
8913.33 and interrupt those patterns.
8915.04 And fortunately, as we described earlier,
8917.02 such treatments exist,
cognitive behavioral therapy,
8920.17 drug treatments like
SSRIs, also drug treatments
8923.38 that tap into the glutamate system
8926.26 and into perhaps also the dopamine system,
8929.65 the so-called neuroleptics.
8930.88 And then, as we described,
8933.34 there's now an extensive
exploration of things
8935.26 like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis,
8938.23 the initial studies don't
seem to hold much promise
8940.42 for cannabis and CBD and
the treatment of OCD,
8942.58 but who knows, maybe more
studies will come along
8944.74 that will change that story.
8946.63 And then of course,
brain machine interface
8948.13 like transcranial magnetic stimulation.
8950.14 And then just to remind you
what I already told you before
8952.69 combinations of behavioral
and drug treatments
8955.39 and brain machine interface, I think,
8956.85 is really where the future lies.
8958.42 Fortunately, good treatments exist.
8961.84 We cannot say that any
one individual treatment
8964.99 works for everybody.
8966.22 There are fairly large
percentages of people
8969.43 that won't respond to one
set of treatments or another,
8971.53 and therefore one has
to try different ones.
8974.08 And then there are the
so-called supplementation-based
8977.83 or more holistic therapies.
8979.81 Today, I've tried to cover each and all
8981.33 of these in a fairly
substantial amount of detail.
8984.91 I realize this is a fairly long episode,
8987.67 that is intentional.
8989.62 Much like our episode on ADHD,
8991.78 on attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder,
8994.18 I received an enormous number of requests
8996.31 to talk about OCD, and
my decision to make this
8999.19 a very long and detailed episode about OCD
9003.0 really doesn't stem from any desire
9004.65 to subject you to too much information
9007.59 or to avoid the opportunity
to just list things off,
9011.61 but what I've tried to
provide is an opportunity
9013.59 to really drill deep
into the neural circuitry
9015.807 and an understanding of
where OCD comes from,
9018.42 how OCD is different from things like
9020.79 the personality disorders
that I described.
9022.95 And also to give you a
sense of how the individual
9026.85 behavioral and drug treatments work
9028.41 and perhaps don't work
9029.94 so that you can really make
the best informed choices,
9032.49 again, highlighting the fact that OCD
9034.62 is an extremely common, extremely common,
9037.83 and yet extremely debilitating condition
9040.44 and one that I hope
that if any of you have,
9042.45 or that you know people that have it
9044.01 that you'll both gain
sympathy and understanding
9046.95 for what they're dealing with,
9048.18 perhaps as a consequence of some
9049.19 of the information presented today,
9051.06 and maybe help them
direct their treatment,
9054.63 find better treatment, and of course,
9056.94 apply those treatments for some relief.

9093.93 During today's podcast and
on many previous episodes
9096.39 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
we talk about supplements.
9099.21 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
9101.37 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them
9103.29 for things like sleep and
focus and anxiety and so on.
9106.29 The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
9108.15 with Momentous Supplements
9109.74 because Momentous Supplements
9110.94 are of the very highest quality,
9112.65 they ship everywhere in the
world, not just in the US,
9115.23 and we wanted to have one location
9116.76 where people could go in order
to access the supplements
9119.37 that we described and
detail the various roles of
9122.01 here on The Huberman Lab Podcast.
9123.81 If you go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
9126.03 you can find those supplements.
9127.95 the catalog of supplements available there
9129.66 is going to be expanding quite a bit
9131.16 in the weeks and months to come.
9132.48 But right now, already, there are a number
9133.83 of different supplements
for enhancing focus,
9135.96 enhancing sleep, and so
on that are available.
9138.3 Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
9141.03 If you're not already
following Huberman Lab
9142.92 on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.
9144.78 There I cover science and
science-related tools,
9147.39 some of which overlap with the content
9149.22 on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
9150.39 and some of which is
distinct from the content
9152.31 on The Huberman Lab Podcast.
9153.54 So again, that's hubermanlab on Instagram
9155.697 and hubermanlab also on Twitter.
