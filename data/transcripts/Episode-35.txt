0.36 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
1.81 where we discuss science,
3.477 and science based tools for everyday life.
9.24 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.26 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.14 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.91 Today, my guest is Jeff Cavaliere.
17.16 Jeff Cavaliere holds a Master
of Science in Physical Therapy
20.13 and is a certified strength
and conditioning specialist.
23.01 He did his training at the
University of Connecticut Storrs,
25.77 one of the top five programs in the world
27.87 in physical therapy and sports medicine.
30.54 I discovered Jeff
Cavaliere over 10 years ago
33.51 from his online content.
35.49 His online content
includes information about
38.01 how to train for strength,
how to train for hypertrophy,
40.89 which is muscle growth,
how to train for endurance,
43.62 as well as how to rehabilitate injuries
46.02 to avoid muscular imbalances,
nutrition and supplementation.
51.18 I've always found his content
52.71 to be incredibly science
based, incredibly clear,
56.37 sometimes surprising, and
always incredibly actionable.
59.91 It is therefore not surprising
61.23 that he has one of the
largest online platforms
63.45 for fitness, nutrition, supplementation,
65.34 and injury rehabilitation.
67.14 Jeff has also worked
with an enormous number
69.3 of professional athletes
70.68 and has served as head physical therapist
72.48 and assistant strength
coach for the New York Mets.
75.09 Again, the content that Jeff
Cavaliere has posted online
77.88 has been so immensely
useful to me over the years,
80.406 that I was absolutely thrilled
82.5 to get the chance to sit down with him
83.85 and ask him about
everything from how to train
87.6 in terms of how to split up the body parts
90.0 that you train across the week,
91.14 how to integrate strength
training and endurance training,
94.2 when to stretch, how to stretch.
95.871 Indeed, we talked about nutrition,
98.01 we talk a bit about supplementation.
100.05 We talk about how to really
avoid creating imbalances
103.5 in muscle and in neural
control over muscle.
106.103 This is one thing that's
really wonderful about Jeff is
108.39 he really has an
understanding of not just how
110.79 muscles and bones, and tendons
and ligaments work together,
113.19 but how the nervous system
interfaces with those.
115.74 We talked about the
mental side of training,
117.57 including when to bring
specific concentration
119.97 to the muscles that you're training,
121.2 and when to think more about
123.0 how to move weights through space
124.83 and think more about
the movements overall.
127.44 I'm certain that you'll find
the conversation that we held
129.589 to be immensely useful and informative
132.24 for your fitness practices
133.68 and also for how you mentally
approach fitness in general,
137.01 and how to set up a
lifelong fitness practice,
139.65 one that will give you the
strength that you desire,
142.02 one that will give you
the aesthetic results
143.403 that you desire.
144.87 One that will set you up for endurance
146.64 and cardiovascular health,
148.05 basically an overall fitness program.
150.27 I really feel this is
where Jeff Cavaliere shines
152.46 above and beyond so many of the other PTs
154.68 and fitness so-called
influencers that are out there.
157.47 Again, everything is grounded in science,
159.39 everything is clear, and
everything is actionable.
162.84 And while we do cover an
enormous amount of information
165.33 during today's episode,
166.59 if you want to dive even
deeper into that information,
169.59 you can go to athleanx.com,
171.48 where you'll find some of Jeff's programs.
173.7 You can also find him
at Athlean-X on YouTube.
177.18 There you'll find videos for instance,
179.01 like the, how to repair or
heal from lower back pain.
181.98 Something that I actually
followed directly
183.84 long before I ever met Jeff,
has over 32 million views,
186.93 and that is not by accident, it's because
189.03 the protocols there again are
surprising and actionable.
191.91 They relieved my back pain
very quickly without surgery.
195.18 So I'm immensely grateful
for that content.
197.52 And it extends into everything from again,
199.95 hypertrophy, endurance and
strength training and so on.
202.5 Again, it's athleanx.com as the website,
205.11 Athlean-X on YouTube, and
also @athleanx on Instagram.
208.65 The Huberman Lab Podcast
is proud to announce that
210.75 we've partnered with
Momentous Supplements.
212.85 We've done that for several reasons.
214.14 First of all,
214.973 the quality of their
supplements is exceedingly high.
217.74 Second of all,
218.67 we wanted to have a location
where you could find
220.56 all of the supplements discussed
on the Huberman Lab Podcast
223.11 in one easy to find place.
225.09 You can now find that place
at livemomentous.com/huberman.
229.44 In addition, Momentous
Supplements ship internationally,
232.77 something that a lot of
other supplement companies
234.63 simply do not do.
235.89 So that's terrific whether
or not you live in the US,
237.78 or you live abroad.
238.86 Right now, not all of the supplements
240.63 that we discuss on the Huberman
Lab Podcast are listed,
243.45 but that catalog of
supplements is being expanded
245.94 very rapidly,
246.81 and a good number of them
that we've talked about,
248.64 some of the more prominent
ones for sleep and focus
250.98 and other aspects of
mental and physical health
253.26 are already there.
254.093 Again, you can find them at
livemomentus.com/huberman.
256.92 Before we begin,
257.97 I'd like to emphasize that
this podcast is separate
260.25 from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.
262.56 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
264.75 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
267.45 and science related tools
to the general public.
270.24 In keeping with that theme,
271.32 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
274.11 Our first sponsor is Athletic
Greens, now called AG1.
277.8 I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
280.92 So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
283.5 The reason that I started taking AG1,
285.21 and the reason I still
take AG1 twice a day,
287.58 is that it covers all of my
foundational health needs
290.31 for mental health, physical
health, and performance.
292.908 As I mentioned earlier, it
has vitamins and minerals
295.65 that cover any deficiencies
I might have in my diet.
298.77 It also has probiotics,
and the probiotics are key
301.62 for supporting the
so-called gut microbiome.
303.87 The gut microbiome are trillions
of little microbacteria
306.36 that live in our gut from our throat
308.22 all the way down to the base of our gut,
310.14 that support everything
from our immune system
312.36 to our hormone health, to the
so-called gut brain access.
315.57 That is, our gut and our brain
are in direct communication
318.21 with one another in ways
that support our mood,
320.67 our ability to think,
and overall brain health.
323.46 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
324.93 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
327.84 to claim a special offer.
329.04 They'll give you five free travel packs,

to mix up Athletic Greens
332.7 while you're on the road,
333.69 and they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3+K2.
337.56 Vitamin D3 and K2 are essential
340.26 for an enormous number of aspects
342.18 of your mental health, physical
health, and performance
344.1 by impacting things
like hormone regulation,
346.5 calcium regulation, and
cardiovascular health.
349.08 Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
352.02 to claim that special offer.
353.55 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
356.25 Eight Sleep makes smart
mattress covers with heating
358.74 and sleep tracking and
importantly cooling capacity.
361.98 I've talked many times
before on this podcast
363.59 or another podcast about
the close relationship
365.852 between temperature and sleep.
367.62 That is, your body temperature
has to drop by about
370.17 one to three degrees in
order to fall asleep,
372.54 and waking up involves
heating up of your body
374.91 by about one to three degrees.
376.71 Now, some people run
cold during the night.
378.57 They need to heat their
sleeping environment.
381.21 Other people run too hot during the night.
383.04 I'm one such person,
384.0 I tend to wake up in
the middle of the night
385.8 if I get warm at all.
387.63 With Eight Sleep, I'm able to
cool my sleeping environment
390.06 in a very precise way,
391.532 even so precise that I can
control the temperature
393.99 at the beginning, middle,
and end of the night
396.09 so that I fall asleep
easily, stay deeply asleep,
398.58 and wake up feeling better
than I've ever felt before.
401.76 The Pod Pro Cover by Eight Sleep
403.29 is their most advanced
solution on the market
405.03 for thermal regulation.
406.41 It pairs dynamic, cooling and heating
408.18 with biometric tracking
if you want to use that.
410.7 Also it has this nice feature
411.75 that it'll vibrate in the
morning to wake you up.
413.85 I'd rather like that
vibration feature too.
415.998 You can add the cover to any mattress
417.96 and start sleeping as cool
as 55 degrees Fahrenheit,
420.48 or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
422.61 So again, it can be customized
to your sleep needs.
425.46 If you want to try Eight Sleep,
426.87 you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

440.73 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
442.926 ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
445.41 that are of the absolute highest quality.
447.3 The company was founded by two,
448.38 all American swimmers from Stanford
449.97 and everything about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses
452.76 is made with performance in mind.
454.62 That said, the aesthetics of
ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses
457.95 is superb.
459.12 I've spent a lifetime
working on the biology
460.95 of the visual system.
461.79 And I can tell you that your visual system
463.23 has to contend with an
enormous number of challenges
465.96 in order to be able to see clearly.
467.7 ROKA understands this
468.81 and has developed their
eyeglasses and sunglasses
471.24 in a manner such that when
you move from say a shady area
474.096 to a brightly lit area,
475.89 or when you are in different
lit environments indoors,
479.01 you can always see with crystal clarity.
481.11 And they won't slip off if you sweat.
483.36 In fact, they were originally
designed for exercise.
485.58 You can wear them while
running or cycling,
487.522 but they have a terrific aesthetics.
489.18 So unlike a lot of so-called
performance or exercise glasses
491.85 that are out there that
make people frankly
493.71 look like cyborgs in my opinion,
495.66 ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses look terrific.
497.76 You'd be proud to wear them
to work, or out to dinner,
500.28 or when you exercise.
502.14 If you want to try ROKA
glasses, you can go to roka.com.
505.23 That's R-O-K-A.com and

508.14 to save 20% off on your first order.
510.3 Again, that's ROKA, R-O-K-A.com
513.03 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
515.22 And now for my discussion
with Jeff Cavaliere.
518.46 Jeff, such a pleasure
for me to have you here.
520.98 - I'm glad to be here, it's amazing.
522.72 - I'm a longtime consumer of your content.
526.44 I've learned a tremendous
amount about fitness,
529.795 both in the weight room and cardio,
532.11 nutrition things that I've
applied for over a decade.
535.17 So for me, this is
particularly meaningful.
537.48 And my goal here is really
to ask a bunch of questions
541.65 to which I'm interested in the answers,
543.6 but also for which I know
545.34 the audience is really curious about.
547.56 So one of your mantras is,
550.79 "If you want to look like an
athlete, train like an athlete"
553.23 and I think that's something
really special that sets aside
556.004 what you do from what a lot of other
559.59 very well qualified people do.
561.78 And in terms of the use
of weights and resistance,
566.25 whether or not it's body
weight or weights in the gym,
568.83 or pulleys versus cardio,
571.183 in terms of overall health
aesthetics and athleticism,
575.01 is there a way that you could point to
578.01 the idea that maybe people should be doing
579.863 50% resistance training and 50% cardio,
583.739 maybe it's 70/30, maybe it's 30/70.
587.43 And here I'm talking
about the typical person
589.8 who would like to maintain, or maybe even
593.37 add some muscle mass,
594.69 probably in particular
areas for most people,
596.91 as opposed to just overall mass.
598.32 Although we'll talk about that later,
599.64 and people who want to maintain
600.57 a relatively low body fat percentage
602.52 and be in good cardiovascular health.
604.38 What's the sort of
contour of a basic program
607.29 that anybody could think
about as a starting place?
610.922 - I think it's like a 60/40 split,
613.53 which would be leaning towards
weight training, strength
616.937 and then the conditioning
aspect be about 40%.
620.837 So if you look at it over a
course of a training week,
622.95 I mean, five days in a
gym would be a great task.
625.44 And obviously not in the gym,
it could be done at home.
627.54 But three days strength training,
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
631.26 Conditioning, Tuesday,
Thursday, you know, two days.
633.36 It's a pretty easy roundabout
way to split that up,
636.72 of course, depending upon training goals.
638.76 And as you said, the
aesthetic goals like that
640.65 will shift dramatically.
642.15 But if you want to see
the benefits of both,
644.646 that's probably the effect
of dose for strength training
648.12 and the effect of dose for conditioning
649.86 at the bare minimum level.
651.03 Again, being a much better
performer conditioning wise,
654.03 you're going to want to do more than that.
655.38 - And in terms of the
duration of those workouts,
658.17 what's your suggestion?
659.34 I've been weight training
for about 30 years,
661.44 running for about 30 years,
and mainly for health.
666.39 And have found that if
I work hard in the gym
670.5 or at resistance training for
more than 60 minutes or so,
674.01 it's very hard for me to
recover, I start getting cold,
676.35 I start getting weaker
from workout to workout,
678.45 but amazingly, at least to me,
680.28 if I keep those workouts to
about 10 minutes of warmup
683.55 and 55 minutes or so of really hard work
688.05 for resistance training,
689.199 and I keep the cardiovascular work
691.17 to about 30 or 45 minutes, I feel great.
694.887 And I seem to make some progress,
697.08 at least someplace in the
workout from workout to workout.
699.87 - Yeah, I mean, those are good numbers,
702.18 'cause those are kind of
numbers that we usually preach.
703.8 We try to keep our workouts to
an hour or less if possible.
706.71 Now, depending upon the
split that you're following,
709.17 if you're on a total body split,
710.97 there's just going to be
more that has to be done
713.07 in a given amount of time.
714.21 And again if you're training
primarily for strength,
717.42 that could prolong the workout,
718.946 'cause of the longer rest
time is in between sets.
720.81 But in general, when you're
not focused on that one aspect,
723.78 but the overall health picture,
725.13 then you can get the job
done in under an hour.
728.85 And again, I always say, on top of
730.897 "If you want to look like an
athlete train, like an athlete,"
732.93 is, "You could either train
longer or you could train hard,
734.667 but you can't do both."
736.05 And I really believe
that the focus for me,
738.84 I have a busy life,
739.999 I have a lot of other things
that I do believe it or not.
741.84 And it's like, I want to go
hard and I want to go get out.
745.02 And I find that my body
also responds to that,
747.567 and I think a lot of guys'
body respond to that.
749.61 And particularly as
you start to get older,
752.178 I think it's the length of the workout
755.404 that actually causes more problems
757.89 than the intensity of what you're doing.
759.96 Particularly if you're warmed
up properly like you said.
762.42 I've found personally that my warmup
764.37 has had to become more of an
integral part of my workout
766.83 than it ever has before.
768.33 I could get in the gym when I was 20,
771.06 and I'm going right over, I'm
doing the one set, two sets,
773.779 I'm ready to go.
775.189 You know, and I never do
another workout warmup set
777.15 for any of the other exercise
I do the rest of the day.
779.268 That's not true anymore.
782.07 And I found that as long as I'm willing
783.93 to sort of give myself a
little bit of a warmup,
785.929 the intensity is not what bothers me.
788.4 I'm very much in control
of the weights that I use
790.647 and it doesn't bother me.
792.27 But if I start to go pretty long,
794.268 I start to feel achy or
I start to have problems.
796.65 So again, depending upon age,
798.3 that also plays a factor in the length.
800.64 But again, I think everybody can achieve,
803.58 on a standard program,
805.26 can achieve the results that
they want within an hour.
808.08 - In terms of splits,
you mentioned splits.
810.09 And so for those who aren't
familiar with this term splits,
812.94 it's really which body
parts are you training on?
815.46 Which days?
816.63 Seems like almost
everybody follows a weekly
819.36 workout schedule.
820.32 Although the body of course
doesn't care about the week.
822.84 There's no reason thing
that once every seven days
824.73 or twice every seven days
makes sense physiologically,
826.83 it's just the body doesn't work that.
828.003 But, that's the way life is structured.
831.3 I've seen you discuss three days a week,
834.75 whole body workouts.
837.03 I've heard of splits
like a pushing one day,
839.978 pulling another day, legs
another day, a day off, repeat.
843.69 I mean, there's so many
variations on this.
845.79 What are some general themes
that we can throw out there?
848.04 And in order to avoid the
huge matrix of possibilities,
851.79 you have some wonderful
content that points those.
853.41 And we will cap-
854.25 In our caption show notes,
we'll link out to some of those
857.37 that different ways to design splits.
859.44 But in terms of giving people a logic
861.66 of how to think about
splitting up body parts,
864.438 what's governing the split?
866.97 What are the rules and the
logic that dictate a split?
870.06 - For me, the first rule
is will you stick to it?
872.97 Like if you, 'cause there are split,
874.23 I don't particularly
like full body splits.
876.96 And I was actually talking to Jesse
878.257 about that the other day like,
879.09 I don't necessarily like to
have to train everything.
882.39 Now of course the volumes will
come down per muscle group.
885.54 But if you don't like to do that,
888.057 and you actually don't look
forward to your workout
890.28 because you're dreading
having to do everything
892.14 and feeling maybe too fatigued
893.94 by the time your workout's over,
895.32 or the fact that those generally
do take a little bit longer
897.72 and don't fit into your schedule.
899.13 I don't care how effective the split is,
901.44 a split not done is not effective.
903.33 So you need to find one that fits.
904.95 So maybe you go into
an alternative option,
907.47 like a push-pull-legs, like you mentioned.
909.78 And that could be done either
one cycle through the week,
913.86 on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday split,
915.33 or it could be twice in a week.
917.19 So you're actually training six times,
919.004 where you repeat it,
pull-push-legs, pull-push-legs,
922.38 or however you want to do it
924.81 with either a day off in
between the three days,
926.97 or at the end of the six days.
929.25 And again, that actually
impacts your schedule.
931.35 I've broken that down before where it's,
933.18 if you put it in between the three days,
935.46 it's good because you're giving
yourself an extra rest day
937.53 in between, but it starts
to shift that day off
940.44 every week as we wrap around.
941.85 So for those guys that we're choosing
943.02 that seven day schedule out
of convenience in our heads,
945.53 it starts to mess with that off day.
947.46 So others like to just
keep it predictably,
949.17 let's say on a Sunday, and
train six days in a row.
952.95 But that's a better way
to maybe group similar
956.925 muscle actions together, which I think,
960.0 I definitely prefer that,
961.53 because if I'm going to be
training pulling movements,
965.01 at least there there's
a synergy between them.
967.14 And I feel like I'm looking
to achieve one goal that day.
971.299 And then, I mean, quite honestly,
973.98 you can go back to the bro-split days,
976.08 and those still work effectively.
978.33 There's a reason why
they worked in the past.
980.52 I think that science shows
that there's smarter ways
983.7 to do them these days.
984.84 Like you can come back
and hit a related muscle,
987.81 so you could do, let's
say biceps on one day
990.45 and then come back two
days later and do back,
992.91 realizing again, synergy
between the exercises there,
996.75 your biceps are going to
get re-stimulated again.
998.82 So you could figure out
ways to make that work,
1001.04 but the thing that I
think is effective there,
1003.11 is that tends to be one of the ones
1004.22 that people like the most.
1005.69 Because they can go in, they
get their pump, they feel good.
1008.481 It's pretty solely focused
on one muscle group.
1011.81 - Is that the definition of a bro-split?
1013.58 One...
- One muscle group a day?
1015.35 - Yeah, I see, so it's
very much geared towards
1017.3 strength and aesthetics
really maximizing...
1019.627 - Probably more aesthetics
than strength, yeah.
1023.06 You're just...
- Hence the bro, the bro name.
1026.0 - But again, like, you know,
in here I am a science guy
1028.01 and I could appreciate the
benefits of a bro-split.
1030.56 Especially 'cause again, like to what end?
1033.261 Who's goal are we trying to achieve here?
1036.68 Those are ours.
1038.33 Like if I'm applying my
standards and my goals
1042.2 or even like athletic ideals,
1044.57 but they just want to get in shape,
1046.37 then it's perfectly fine to do
a bro split in that instance,
1050.54 if you're sticking to it again
1052.31 and you're seeing the results
that you want to see from it.
1054.59 But they're able to really
keep their focus on one muscle,
1058.67 they get to focus on.
1060.051 Look, a lot of times people struggle with
1062.151 the way of an exercise feels
1064.64 until their second or third set.
1066.14 Like they don't have that
proper percept of ability
1068.15 to kind of lock in on an exercise.
1069.8 So spending a few, not only
sets in the same exercise,
1074.48 but then doing another exercise
for the same muscle group
1076.49 helps them to dial in a little bit better
1077.87 and get more out of their training.
1079.4 - Yeah, that raised a really interesting,
1081.32 I think important question.
1082.43 Early on when I started
resistance training,
1084.71 which was when I was 16 in high school,
1086.9 I got in touch with and I was
learning from Mike Menzer.
1090.68 - Me too, that's crazy.
1093.62 - And Mike was very helpful.
1095.12 Very, very helpful.
1095.953 We got to be friendly...
1096.786 - So, I just read his book,
1097.76 I didn't get a chance to be
him, so I'm jealous, right?
1099.77 - Well, back then no internet,
1102.739 I paid by Western Union type
thing to send him some money
1106.43 - From the back of the magazine.
1107.263 - And then he got on the phone with me
1109.01 and my mother at the time was like,
1110.24 why is this grown man calling the house?
1112.49 And he gave me a very
straightforward split,
1114.59 which was shoulders, arms one day,
1116.36 he had me taking two days
off and then training legs
1119.18 and then two days off and then
chest and back, et cetera.
1121.73 - And that's a variation
of a bro-split too.
1123.47 Where you're sort of
breaking them down that way,
1125.36 chest them back or chest
them bis, you know?
1127.387 - And it worked very well for me,
1129.11 I probably would've,
because of my age I think,
1131.12 and because I was untrained,
I think, largely untrained,
1134.24 I think it would've grown
on many different programs,
1137.06 but it worked very well for me.
1138.44 I eventually just made that
in every other day thing.
1141.5 Shoulders and arms day
off, legs day or two off,
1144.08 'cause if you hit legs
right, at least for me,
1146.115 I'm not training the next day.
1148.003 And then I'm not doing
much of anything athletic
1150.8 the next day, and chest,
back and repeat and so on.
1153.26 And the reason I found that helpful
1155.3 is I almost always
recovered between workouts.
1158.655 The six day a week
program of push-pull-legs,
1162.32 push-pull-legs, to me seems excruciating
1165.27 from two standpoints.
1167.15 One is, at least with
my recovery abilities,
1170.03 or lack of recovery abilities,
1171.38 I can't imagine coming back feeling fresh.
1173.66 And the other one is,
1174.92 if I'm in the gym more
than four days a week,
1177.32 I really start to fatigue it
1179.27 about the whole psychological
experience of it.
1181.58 Whereas if I'm in there
three or four days a week.
1183.98 In other words, if I put a day
off in between each workout,
1186.56 I really want to be there.
1188.12 And I get in there with a lot of fire.
1190.735 And I'm also doing other
things on the off days.
1192.95 So I think that, I love that you mentioned
1195.23 the split that you'll stick to.
1196.46 And that you can bring the intensity to,
1199.22 because I think that
that's really important.
1200.92 I sometimes hear about two a day training.
1203.42 I've done two a day training
twice in my lifetime,
1205.46 both times I got sick two days later.
1207.625 That's correlation, not causation.
1210.56 But is there ever an
instance where two a day
1214.34 weight training makes sense
1216.11 for the non-drug assisted,
typical recovery ability person?
1221.51 - Actually, I think it makes
sense in some scenarios,
1224.72 but it doesn't make sense practically
1226.28 for a lot of people's schedules.
1227.42 So like if you could break down,
1229.61 let's say you were going to do even
1233.33 some version of a total body session,
1235.22 or maybe like you're going to
do an upper lower split, right?
1238.4 You could do an upper workout
and do the anterior chain
1242.54 or the pushing portion
of that in one session
1245.63 and then come back and do
the pulling session later on
1248.75 at night, if you had the opportunity to.
1251.15 The thing that you benefit from there
1252.37 is the freshness of focus.
1254.06 Again, like something
in my head is sacrificed
1257.87 by the time you get
towards the latter half
1259.97 of whatever workout you're in.
1261.16 To the same point you made before like,
1262.91 when you start to approach
that 50 minutes an hour mark,
1266.36 you are either losing
focus, you're losing energy,
1268.49 you're losing contract viability,
you're losing something.
1271.4 And if you're relegating whatever it is,
1274.22 the pulling portion of that
to the end of that workout,
1276.71 something suffers so that,
1278.15 and if they realize that's happening,
1279.95 then maybe you switch them up
1281.09 the next time you do the workout
1282.17 where the pulling portion of
the upper workout goes first,
1284.75 and then the pushing goes later,
1286.1 so you're at least not
just continuing that cycle,
1289.58 but at the same time,
1290.84 if you were able to kind of split them up,
1292.363 you get a chance to kind of take a break,
1294.89 you could have that
freshness of focus again,
1296.87 and you could actually
get a better effort in,
1298.67 'cause again, I think
effort drives the results.
1300.77 So if the effort is not compromised,
1302.66 then you should be able to do that.
1304.04 But systemically is that a problem?
1307.268 And I think that it is a
problem for a lot of people.
1308.603 It's just hard to,
1310.148 it's hard to rev the engine
up a lot of times in the day.
1313.07 You warm that thing up once,
1314.51 it's like that car in the
winter, you get it going once,
1316.55 you're lucky, okay,
1317.383 now you got to drive
it the rest of the day.
1318.77 But you put it in the garage
1321.56 and try to start it the
next day, it's a problem.
1324.11 So, you know, young people
can get away with it
1326.39 a lot more than older people could.
1328.91 - Well, I've never had a
strong recovery quotient,
1330.83 but if I stick to this
one day off in between,
1332.904 every once in a while, two
days in a row training,
1335.54 maybe because I have to travel
1336.74 and I want to make sure
I get all the workouts
1338.27 and kind of thing, I seem to be okay.
1340.31 I like your example of warming up the car,
1341.96 spoken like a true east coaster,
1344.359 or those of us are on the west coast,
1346.25 I took a moment there,
1347.15 but we folks from the East
Coast and the Midwest, get it,
1351.53 and certainly from Europe.
1353.99 In terms of the mixing up
of cardiovascular training
1358.842 and resistance training,
same day, different day,
1363.705 which one should come first,
which one should come second?
1367.31 If one main goals, again,
1369.74 everyone listening has
different goals are,
1371.78 most people would like to either maintain
1373.16 or gain some muscle.
1374.57 I don't know many people
that want to lose muscle.
1376.24 To maintain or gains some muscle,
1377.72 usually in specific
locations on their body,
1380.39 most people would like to be
a bit leaner or a lot leaner.
1383.03 There are a few people out there that are
1384.74 either naturally lean or don't want,
1386.18 or actually just want to gain weight.
1387.5 But assuming that people
want to get leaner,
1389.21 put on some muscle, maintain muscle,
1390.74 and want to have a healthy
heart and a healthy brain,
1393.95 which basically requires a
healthy cardiovascular system,
1396.611 how would you incorporate
cardiovascular work
1400.04 into the overall weekly regimen?
1403.73 - So again, I think that the bare minimum
1406.34 is probably twice a week
in terms of cardiovascular.
1408.83 If you want to have some semblance
1410.33 of cardiovascular conditioning.
1411.5 But I think most people
who actually need it more
1413.96 or want to pursue it more than that
1416.06 are going to need more time to do that.
1417.83 So at some point it can't just
be relegated to a day off,
1421.91 or a day off from the
weight training workouts.
1424.82 So at some point it has
to occur on the same day.
1428.3 And in that case, I just like to put it,
1430.333 if that is, you're not your primary goal,
1432.98 but you're looking more for
the, just the overall picture,
1436.04 the aesthetics you mentioned,
1437.0 putting muscle on in certain areas,
1438.68 then I would put it at
the end of the workout.
1439.867 'Cause you don't want
it in any way compromise
1442.73 the weight training work out.
1444.02 And as we've sort of referenced
a couple times already,
1446.3 the intensity of those
workouts is important.
1448.7 And we know there's a strength component
1451.22 to those workouts also that is going to
1454.004 be a helpful stimulus for growth.
1457.07 So the conditioning, the cardio,
1459.47 that stuff done prior to any training,
1462.38 strength training, workout,
1463.55 is likely going to impair your ability
1465.65 to perform at your best.
1467.15 So unless it's just done
for a quick little warmup
1469.31 in the beginning,
1470.143 but then it's not sustained
long enough really to be
1471.98 a benefit for cardiovascular conditioning.
1474.11 So I just like to put that at the end,
1477.391 realizing that even if
my effort level is lower,
1482.39 my output is lower,
1483.89 if it's still placing a
demand on my cardiac output
1487.85 to get that conditioning
effect because I'm fatigued,
1491.03 it still has a demand
on my cardiac output,
1492.77 so it's still achieving its goal,
1494.15 but it didn't interfere with my main goal
1496.15 of being able to increase
my performance in the gym.
1498.8 - Got it.
1499.633 And in terms of the form
of cardiovascular training,
1502.25 I've seen you do a number of,
I have to say very impressive
1507.32 high intensity interval type work.
1509.21 So burpee type work,
1510.71 or pushups with crunches mixed into them,
1514.13 anyway, people can see your videos,
1515.81 I didn't describe those in the best way,
1517.76 but rather than on the treadmill
1520.97 or out jogging for 30-45 minutes,
1522.98 is that because you
prefer higher intensity,
1525.407 higher heart rate type training,
1528.26 or is it because you
live in cold Connecticut,
1530.116 and you don't want to be
out jogging on the roads
1533.3 in the middle of the winter?
1535.16 - I think all the above,
1536.3 I mean, those are factors
from a personal level,
1538.49 but I think that if you are-
1541.909 If we could blend function
across these realms
1546.62 and not have such a delineation between,
1549.08 this is my way training,
and this is my conditioning,
1551.48 but figure out a way
to blend them together,
1554.3 I always think that you've got
a better opportunity to get
1557.42 that more well rounded result.
1559.64 And I like to kind of mix up
that straight conditioning work
1563.48 and also some of the footwork drills.
1566.18 We have some high expectations for guys
1568.07 that come into our programs,
1569.33 like to just do some footwork drills.
1571.64 - Like ladders.
- Like ladders,
1572.96 or line drills or something.
1574.4 And you know what happens?
1575.233 People become intrigued and interested.
1576.98 Like I never, I haven't
tried this since high school.
1580.4 And they become interested
in just the challenge of it,
1583.22 and then as we become almost
distracted by the challenge,
1586.4 we're now like finding
ourselves conditioning.
1588.86 And I always think
that's an important part,
1591.35 that sometimes you got to draw people in
1594.95 to show them what they
might be interested in.
1596.84 And from the output or the effect of it,
1599.12 I just think that when
you're able to blend some,
1601.67 still maintain some of
that strength training
1604.28 into the exercise, as you mentioned,
1606.05 let's say I'm doing some kind
of a push up or a burpee,
1608.3 there is an anaerobic component to that
1611.99 that is going to be helpful,
1613.58 that then rather than just
walking or just jogging.
1617.84 Not to say that that
isn't an effective means
1620.57 for strict cardiac conditioning,
1623.354 it's one of the ways that
we've had for centuries,
1626.87 how to do it.
1627.71 But I just think that if we can blend it,
1630.17 then it becomes maybe a
little bit more interesting
1632.48 and you get some of
those crossover benefits,
1634.7 and it doesn't become so segmented
1636.29 in terms of what we're trying to do.
1637.97 - I love the idea of bringing
some mental challenge
1640.7 and some desire to improve
a skill while conditioning.
1643.52 That's not something that
I've thought of before,
1645.32 and it's simply 'cause I've overlooked it,
1646.91 but it makes sense because, my
sister who's reasonably fit,
1649.85 although I'm always trying
to get her to do a bit more,
1651.809 she always asks me, what should I take?
1654.41 And I'm a, I don't
believe her in supplements
1656.42 are for certain people
in certain instances,
1658.16 but I keep telling her, you know, it's,
1659.99 the behaviors are going to end,
1662.09 nutrition are going to
have the greatest outsize
1664.52 positive effect.
1665.75 And she loves things like
dance classes and things,
1669.545 or kickboxing, these
kinds of things which,
1672.11 so it makes sense that
if you can hook somebody
1674.66 on the conditioning
aspect or the skill aspect
1676.82 and kind of trick them
into doing more cardio,
1678.95 so to speak that's terrific.
1680.63 Also the neuroscientist
in me just has to say,
1683.24 forgive me, that anytime you're engaging
1686.48 the two sets of motor neurons,
the ones in your brain,
1689.3 the upper motor neurons and
the ones in your spinal cord,
1691.07 anytime you're engaging
those upper motor neurons,
1692.75 which are for deliberate
well controlled action,
1695.593 you're doing a great thing for your brain
1697.91 in terms of brain longevity.
1699.11 So, now I need to incorporate
some actual skills
1702.89 into my training.
1705.135 Going back to weight training a bit,
1707.24 one of the most important
things I learned from you,
1710.81 so over the years was that,
1713.745 when training to increase
muscle size, to really think,
1718.1 not so much about moving weights,
1719.78 but more about challenging muscles.
1721.46 - Yeah.
1722.293 - I also heard this from
my friend, Ben Pakulski,
1725.3 who's a very well accomplished,
1726.92 He was a bodybuilder,
1727.88 now he's into other aspects
of fitness, teaches fitness,
1730.37 but don't move weights challenge muscles,
1732.44 unless you're trying to power lift
1733.85 or something of that sort, which
I'm not, immensely helpful.
1737.39 But the other thing that
I learned from you that,
1740.118 combined with that was this idea that
1743.539 certain muscles will grow
better and get stronger
1746.93 much more easily, maybe
even will recover better
1749.84 because of our ability to
contract them really hard.
1752.54 And this what I call the Cavaliere test,
1754.67 which is at least if I could paraphrase,
1758.638 so for instance, if I can, it's
always the bicep, isn't it?
1763.588 Let's use the calf or the bicep.
1765.29 If you can flex your
bicep to the point where
1768.29 it hurts a little bit,
1769.67 like it almost feels
like a cramp or a cramp,
1771.938 where you can flex your
calf to the point where
1773.06 it really cramps up a little bit,
1774.32 almost feels like it's nodding up,
1776.03 that's a pretty good indication
1777.53 that you're going to be able to
1779.0 stimulate that muscle well under load
1781.458 if you're doing the movement properly.
1783.83 And that's the feeling to
actually aim for each repetition,
1786.47 maybe even throughout the repetition.
1788.477 For me, this completely
transformed my results.
1792.68 And this was, I think
maybe five/six years ago
1794.57 that I first heard this from you,
1795.92 body parts that for me, lagged behind,
1798.56 that I thought maybe genetically
weren't going to work for me,
1801.05 immediately just started growing, right?
1804.2 And I was getting stronger and stronger,
1806.12 and I thought this is
really something so much so
1808.4 that I've dedicated a
portion of my research
1810.797 along with, in collaboration
with another group
1813.65 to try and understand
1814.937 what's happening in these upper
motor neurons in the brain
1818.06 that can engage the muscles even more.
1820.25 And that it's not just
about progressive overload
1822.71 or putting a pump into the muscle.
1824.417 That it's really this
mind muscle connection
1828.11 is a real thing when it
comes to predicting results
1830.69 and that you can get better at it.
1832.43 So forgive me if we're paraphrasing
1834.527 your incredible content around this,
1836.36 it made a tremendous difference for me
1838.7 and a number of other people
that have passed that along to.
1841.01 But what can you, first of all,
how did you arrive at that?
1845.18 Because we hear about the
mind-muscle connection,
1846.83 but I really heard it first from you.
1848.6 How did you arrive at
this kind of cramp test,
1850.572 the Cavaliere test as I'll call it?
1852.282 It's always weird when people name things
1853.76 after themselves in science,
1855.02 but other scientists can name things.
1856.88 So there is now officially
the Cavaliere test,
1858.89 is whether or not you can cramp the muscle
1861.17 in the absence of load, just flexing it
1863.23 to the point where it hurts a little bit.
1864.71 That would be a good indication
1866.87 that you could grow that muscle well.
1868.97 How did you come up with this?
1870.92 - I mean, honestly, it's
something that made sense to me,
1875.0 because during my workouts,
even as a young kid
1879.23 just starting out, I always wanted to know
1881.54 what is it working?
1882.59 A lot of people ask that
question more so than you think,
1884.63 like, what is this supposed to work?
1886.31 And a lot, I don't know
if you've ever noticed,
1888.77 but like when people ask that question,
1890.45 if they're being trained by a trainer,
1892.28 and the trainer's saying,
well, just do this,
1894.53 do this exercise and they'll
show you how to do it.
1897.08 But then they'll say, but
what is it supposed to work?
1899.3 Where am I supposed to feel this, right?
1900.89 People, did they just
inherently ask that question?
1903.62 A lot of people will.
1905.12 I was one of those that did
that, and I asked that question.
1907.46 Not because I knew what I was doing,
1908.51 but just because I don't know,
1909.65 I wanted to know what was
supposed to be doing the work.
1912.852 Once you do that, and you
start to seek that out,
1915.29 and say, okay, well,
1916.52 the bicep is what's supposed
to be doing the work,
1918.836 then I want to make sure
the bicep's doing the work.
1921.77 So then I would just sort of
really like tweak the movement
1925.07 to make it do more work or
feel more uncomfortable,
1927.77 or get it stronger contraction,
1929.09 knowing if that's supposed to do the job,
1930.716 it wasn't until PT
school that I'm learning,
1933.35 oh, well, the flexion of the elbow
1935.15 is the brachial and the bias
1936.5 and the bias' responsible for supination.
1938.716 You started to, I learned
other components of it,
1940.49 but all I wanted to know was
to bring my arm up in a curl,
1943.4 what is supposed to do the job?
1945.05 So I would seek out ways
to make that happen better.
1950.237 And when I was able to do that,
1951.77 I could feel the stronger contraction.
1953.78 And I just, I don't know what it, I just,
1955.52 I was no visionary, I just felt like
1957.08 I knew that that was
going to be better for me
1959.3 if the muscle I was trying to grow
1960.89 was being stressed more effectively.
1963.29 So when I was attempting to do this
1967.19 across different exercises,
I would notice that
1970.19 what I could do potentially
on a curl where my arm is up,
1974.57 where you asking me to flex
my bicep that position,
1976.974 I couldn't do if I was
doing a concentration curl,
1980.9 or I couldn't carry over to a cable curl,
1983.78 and that shouldn't really change,
1986.24 'cause the function is
still largely the same,
1988.52 there's still elbow flexion,
there's still supination,
1991.31 why am I not able to do it there?
1993.35 And that's when it sort of
clued into me that like,
1995.511 your mind-muscle connection on
1998.18 not just your mind with one muscle,
2000.58 but on every exercise matters,
2002.71 and it varies from exercise to exercise.
2005.2 And even if you don't gain
muscle size from doing that,
2008.5 although I think it's very hard not to,
2010.36 especially if you're
not used to doing that,
2012.025 there's a term I like to call muscularity,
2014.966 which is a difference, right?
2016.78 It's the level of sort of
resting tone in the muscle.
2019.36 That improves dramatically.
2021.43 If you can learn how to just start to
2023.636 engage that muscle better,
2026.185 the muscularity, the
resting tone of that muscle
2029.62 is harder, it's more at
attention, it's more alive.
2035.71 And it's all driven from
being able to connect better
2039.04 neurologically with the muscle
that you're trying to train.
2042.07 I've talked about a lot in efficiency
2044.533 is really what you're
trying to seek in movements
2047.5 when you're trying to create hypertrophy.
2049.9 When strength is your goal,
2051.01 efficiency of the movement
is what you're looking for.
2053.05 You're looking to have
muscles tied together
2055.45 and work well efficiently,
2057.04 the chest, the shoulders, the triceps,
2058.81 to get a bar off of your
chest or in a bench press.
2061.24 You're not looking to
make it a very inefficient
2064.446 leverages for your chest,
2066.46 to try to grow your
chest in a bench press,
2068.53 you're trying to let the
whole package come together
2071.17 for a greater output.
2072.34 But when you're trying to go
and create muscle hypertrophy
2075.07 or even this muscularity
that I talk about,
2077.2 you need to seek ways to make
it feel more uncomfortable.
2079.747 If you don't feel the discomfort,
2081.97 then you're doing something wrong.
2083.29 And I struggle to this day
on certain muscle groups
2086.35 to still do that, even knowing
what I'm trying to work
2088.96 and knowing what the goal of
everything I'm preaching here.
2091.78 It's very difficult for some muscles
2093.217 and for certain people to
do this on certain muscles.
2095.56 But as you mentioned, practice does help.
2098.86 And the more you become consistent
2101.68 and deliberate with what
you're trying to do,
2103.45 the more of a result you actually get.
2105.546 - It's couple of really
couple of points I'd like
2108.79 to delve into further.
2112.06 First of all, my hunch was always that
2114.52 the muscle groups that grew most easily
2118.0 and that I could contract
hardest without any-
2121.27 The first time I did the
Cavaliere test, got 10 out 10.
2123.966 If we give it a 10 out of 10 scale.
2125.29 It could just like cinch,
isolate those muscles,
2127.21 cinch them, grow them easily.
2128.86 I mean, there's certain body parts,
2130.18 I don't want to say which ones,
2131.013 'cause it doesn't really
matter, that I always felt like
2133.51 if I just did pushups, they would grow,
2135.22 and these muscles are far
away from any of the muscles
2136.783 that are supposed to
be involved in pushups,
2138.49 even though I like to think
I'm doing pushups correctly.
2141.22 You'll tell me if I'm not.
2143.144 But some of that I think is genetic,
2146.17 and some of that has to do
with the sports that I played
2148.84 when I was younger.
2149.8 So I swam, I played soccer, I skateboard.
2152.08 And then later I boxed.
2153.13 And so the muscles
involved in those sports
2155.829 were always very easy to engage
2158.11 later when I went into the gym.
2159.744 So I guess perhaps a call to parents,
2163.69 having kids do a lot of dynamic activity,
2165.805 seems like it might be a good idea.
2168.31 The other thing is this
issue of muscularity.
2171.49 I am so glad you brought that up.
2172.9 There are, I have to imagine
a large number of listeners
2176.5 who don't want to get bigger.
2178.03 They don't want to take
up a larger clothing size.
2180.58 They don't want to take up more space.
2183.4 In fact, some of them would
like to take up less space,
2185.2 but they want that quality
that you're describing,
2188.47 which is that, oftentimes
you hear it more in the,
2191.77 here I'm stereotyping a
bit, but with kindness.
2194.413 You hear from women who
haven't weight trained,
2197.47 they say, I don't want to get big, often.
2199.03 Sometimes they do,
2199.863 but most women that
I've helped weight train
2201.85 or talked to about weight train say,
2202.81 I don't want to get big,
I want to get toned.
2204.46 And I think what they're referring to
2206.11 is this quality of muscularity.
2208.061 - A hundred percent,
- This idea that at resting
2210.91 or at close to rest, or
anytime someone reaches out
2213.1 and grabs a glass,
2214.12 that the muscles almost look
like they're kind of twitching
2216.25 underneath the skin.
2217.39 And yet it's Saran wrap skin
anatomy chart type skin.
2222.13 So this thing of
muscularity, or resting tone,
2225.928 has a physiological basis,
2227.65 I think it's how readily the nerves
2229.72 are communicating with the muscles.
2231.25 And you're saying that by
learning to engage the muscles
2234.79 more actively, the resting tone
or muscularity can improve.
2238.27 Have you seen that both in men and women?
2240.46 - Yeah, oh yeah.
2241.293 - And do you think this is
something that takes upkeep,
2245.38 maintenance, or that once
you develop that in a muscle,
2248.26 you can just kind of let it coast.
2249.773 - I think like everything
at key, it requires upkeep,
2252.82 you know, user lose it,
I do believe firmly,
2255.55 but like I think that the
development of the connections
2258.97 is going to be harder than the
maintenance of the connection.
2261.16 As I said, I still struggle
to this day for myself with
2264.412 unnamed muscle groups, they also,-
2267.31 But there's just certain areas
2271.84 that are harder for your
brain for whatever reason
2274.69 to just develop that connection
at that type of level
2277.87 to create that extra strong contraction.
2280.69 But I think that with
proper dedication and focus,
2284.44 and then I'll go right out and say,
2286.18 calves is one of the areas that
2287.65 I don't necessarily have
a great connection with,
2289.87 and I also obviously must not care so much
2292.36 'cause I don't put in the time and effort
2294.07 to create that connection as I could.
2297.547 So I think what might happen is,
2300.46 you know yeah, there
could be a struggle there,
2301.9 but then with struggle comes disinterest,
2303.951 'cause you're like, well
screw it, I'm a calf knot
2306.34 and I'm not going to do anything about it.
2307.66 So I think if you put
the required effort in,
2311.62 and the time and repetitions
that you will develop that,
2313.777 and once you do develop it,
it's going to stick around
2316.18 a lot longer than it would
2317.47 had you not invested
any time into it at all,
2319.726 not requiring as much of that.
2321.88 But I mean, I don't
know, like you mentioned,
2324.556 now when you train, it's like,
2326.716 you're just, this is just
part of how you train now,
2329.74 like you're going hard,
2330.79 you're trying to really
forcefully contract.
2333.46 You're not just moving the weight,
2335.32 I say from point A to point B,
2337.09 but you're like trying
to contract the weight
2339.46 through that range.
2340.735 That is a mindset that I try to put into
2344.35 what everything I'm doing,
2345.49 unless of course I'm focused
on a strength exercise
2348.28 where I'm just trying
to lift a greater amount
2351.16 and use all the muscles together.
2352.9 But when the goal is
inefficiency for hypertrophy,
2355.72 I am really trying to
create that contraction,
2359.74 and it's just part of my training.
2361.42 So I guess that for consistency's sake,
2364.93 as long as I'm training is happening.
2366.58 If I get away from training
that it's not happening at all,
2369.58 but you know, even there,
2370.48 I probably another embarrassing
admission probably,
2373.69 will mindfully do it throughout the day,
2375.52 even with no weight in my
hand, in certain muscle groups,
2378.31 whether it be my abs or my arm
or my shoulders or something,
2380.98 I'm doing something just to
sort of engage the muscles.
2383.02 And I do think that some of
that sort of inane practice
2386.65 actually helps by the time
you go back into the gym.
2388.9 You just kind of keep
that connection going.
2392.23 - Well, it certainly obeys all
the rules of neuroplasticity.
2395.29 You know the fire together
wired together mantra,
2397.9 which is the words of my
colleague, Carla Shatz,
2400.78 hold true for all aspects
of neural function,
2403.45 including nerve to muscle.
2405.1 So these flexing throughout the day
2406.69 or the deliberate isolation
of contracting a muscle
2410.59 throughout the day is without question
2412.75 engaging neuroplasticity.
2414.04 And if you were to do
fewer those repetitions,
2415.87 you're going to get less engagement
2417.4 of the nerve to muscle connection.
2418.84 I can say this with a smile
and with confidence because,
2422.83 one of the first things all
neuroscience students learn
2424.9 is about the neuromuscular junction,
2426.49 'cause it's a really
simple example of where
2429.43 the more times the nerve fires
2430.78 and gets the muscle to contract,
2432.25 the stronger that connection get,
2433.57 receptors are brought
there, et cetera, et cetera,
2435.4 there's a whole bunch of
mechanisms for a topic
2437.56 of another podcast.
2439.15 But basically that
practice throughout the day
2443.65 makes total sense and works.
2445.65 - Yeah, and there's no, believe me,
2447.69 there's no science behind that
2448.72 in terms of the application of it.
2450.46 You do it when,
2451.66 you catch yourself doing
it from time to time.
2454.3 But it is definitely
something that's easily done
2456.91 discreetly and you wind up doing.
2459.22 I actually, I think in a recent
video when I did talk about
2463.025 growing your arms by just
improving the connection.
2467.35 Not that that connection
itself is applying any load
2470.23 or resistance that's significant
2472.54 to create overload for growth,
2473.95 but it's the development
of that connection
2475.83 that I then take back with me into the gym
2478.09 at a more effective level
2479.44 that takes every exercise I do there
2481.12 and makes it more effective.
2482.14 - That's like sharpening
the blade, so to speak.
2484.89 Yeah, certainly obeys the laws
2487.545 of nerve to muscle physiology.
2490.9 Wanted to just touch
on a couple of things.
2493.138 If the goal is to challenge muscles,
2496.33 and one is dividing their
body into, let's say,
2499.45 a three or four day a week
split or so, or maybe up to six,
2504.19 how do you know when a muscle is ready
2506.98 to be challenged again?
2508.361 Again, I've heard, okay, every 48 hours is
2510.73 protein synthesis increases
and then we'll get into this
2513.4 and then it drops off.
2514.75 But frankly, if I train my legs hard,
2519.066 I can get stronger from
workout to workout,
2521.71 or at least better in some
way, workout to workout,
2524.68 leg workout to leg workout,
2526.3 training them once every
five to eight days.
2529.51 If I train them more often, I get worse.
2532.93 So whatever that 48 hour
to 72 hour thing is,
2537.22 somehow my legs don't obey that,
2538.96 or maybe something else is wrong with me,
2541.42 but I'm sure there are many
things else wrong with me,
2543.64 but how do you assess
recovery at the local level,
2547.93 meaning at the level of the muscles,
2549.49 so we'll talk about soreness,
2550.99 and getting better, stronger,
more repetitions, et cetera?
2553.96 And then at the systemic level,
2555.34 the level of the nervous system.
2556.87 And I'd love for you to
tell us about the tool that,
2560.02 again, I learned from you,
2560.98 which is actually using a physical scale,
2563.23 because it turns out that,
2565.57 will let you tell what the tool is,
2567.58 but that tool is also actively being used
2570.64 for assessing cognitive decline,
and cognitive maintenance,
2574.36 and cognitive function
2575.38 in people with Alzheimer's and dementia.
2577.36 - That makes total sense.
2579.22 Makes total sense.
2581.59 So regarding the first
part of the question,
2586.235 how would you kind of dictate
when a muscle's recovered?
2589.6 So I do think that what you're
experiencing is totally real,
2594.49 that different muscles
recover at different rates.
2597.22 And I've always been so
fascinated by this concept.
2601.12 I've talked about internally
with my team, but like,
2603.97 I feel like what we really need
the holy grail to training,
2608.68 is going to be when we're
able to crack the code
2610.9 on an individual basis,
when a muscle is recovered,
2614.83 and that is going to dictate
its training schedule.
2617.56 And the fact that you might have a bicep
2620.95 that could be trained
via a pulling workout,
2624.43 a regular bicep dedicated workout,
2625.78 forget to split at the moment.
2626.8 You may have a bicep
that's able to be trained,
2628.809 that can be trained again the next day.
2632.92 And then the next day,
2633.753 and then maybe you need
a day off after that.
2635.23 But like, that can vary from
person to person for sure,
2639.16 and it can vary from muscle
to muscle in that person
2641.8 over the course of time as you mentioned,
2644.26 'cause the systemic
recovery is going to impact
2646.51 all those muscles anyway,
2647.68 but let's say you're
systemically recovering,
2649.674 every muscle itself is going
to have a recovery rate.
2654.31 And I think what's fascinating is that,
2656.56 when you talked about before
we like to train in this week,
2659.35 or we have, like the way
our mind looks at training,
2662.2 well, if that was the
case with the biceps,
2664.69 that bicep is a slave to the
rest of your training split.
2668.74 Where it's like, well, why
does it have to be also
2671.38 at the end of every
eighth day or whatever,
2674.47 when it might respond better to something
2676.72 much more frequently?
2677.74 And your legs are also
being thrown into that mix.
2680.98 There's a Mike Menzer
concept where he's like,
2682.69 train one set and be done for 14 days.
2685.99 I mean, there's such variability
between muscle groups
2690.97 and you're linking them all together.
2693.574 I think that coming back
and using muscle soreness
2699.25 as a guideline for that, is
one of the only tools we have
2703.63 in terms of the local level.
2705.25 You know we don't really
have, being able to measure,
2707.86 let's say CPK levels inside
of a muscle would be amazing,
2711.55 at a local level to see how
recovered that muscle is,
2716.11 but that becomes fairly invasive,
at least to my knowledge,
2719.02 it becomes fairly invasive.
2720.04 So what are our tools?
2721.99 I mean, I think that at the basic level,
2723.91 that's the one that most
people can relate to
2725.29 and easily identify, and
then use that as a guideline.
2727.78 And if you're training
when you're really sore,
2729.619 it's probably not a great idea.
2732.25 And it's probably a good indication
2733.66 that that muscle's not recovered,
2735.04 but at least hearing what
you and I are saying here
2737.26 might be a comfort to the person to say,
2738.61 yeah, it is possible
that it's not recovered.
2741.04 Just because 48 hours
is the recommendation.
2743.097 And just because research points
to muscle protein synthesis
2746.02 needing a restimulation, well, maybe not,
2747.97 maybe you're not necessarily there yet.
2750.136 For that muscle that you're not there yet.
2752.842 So it's all really interesting stuff,
2754.63 but as far as the systemic recovery,
2758.677 I think there's a lot of
ways people talk about
2761.08 resting heart rate
measured in the morning,
2763.267 all different kinds of core temperature
2767.32 and things like that
that might become altered
2769.27 in a state of non recovery.
2772.42 But grip strength is very
much tied to performance
2776.92 and recovery.
2778.15 And when I was at the Mets,
2779.53 we used to actually take
grip strength measurements
2782.17 as a baseline in spring
training all the time.
2784.3 Now, obviously as a baseball player,
2785.65 you're gripping a bat, you're pitcher,
2786.97 you're gripping a ball like-
2788.29 Having good grip strength is important,
2789.79 so if you've noticed somebody
had a very weak grip,
2792.04 it's just a good focal point
2793.45 of a specialized training
component for the...
2795.52 - Would you use this
every day with those guys?
2797.05 - No, we would do, in spring training,
2798.55 we do sort of a baseline
entry level measurement.
2800.879 And then we would measure
it throughout the season,
2803.2 maybe once every two weeks or three weeks.
2805.15 And the idea there was
to manage the recover,
2810.04 measure the recovery.
2812.197 But I just gave it away, to
determine overall recovery,
2817.06 your grip strength is
pretty highly correlated.
2819.07 So we have found that
with one of those scales,
2821.98 those old fashioned bathroom scales
2823.69 at like the bathroom and
beyond, or whatever you can get,
2825.85 which by the way, almost impossible,
2827.77 I believe Jesse and I were
searching for the last scale
2829.84 to put in that video.
2830.95 And we almost couldn't find one,
2832.21 'cause everything is like
digital and everything.
2834.97 I'm looking at the old
fashioned dial controls.
2837.46 - It's like old Macintosh computers.
2839.53 There's a huge market
for them and old phones.
2842.47 Kids keep your phones now.
2843.79 In 30 years, the lame phone now
2846.37 will be worth a lot of money.
- It'll be worth a lot.
2848.273 So, I wound up finding
one, and it's a great tool
2854.17 for just squeezing the
scale with your hands
2857.693 and seeing what type of
output you could get.
2860.981 And I think we all can relate to this
2863.56 when you just visualize,
2865.3 imagine the last time you
were sick, or that when you,
2867.55 or just try this, the next time
you wake up in the morning,
2869.59 when you first wake up in the
morning, you're still groggy.
2871.93 Try to squeeze your hand,
2873.16 try to make a fist as hard as you can.
2874.93 You're going to sit
there angry at your fist
2876.79 because it won't contract
as hard as you know it can.
2879.67 You don't have the ability
to just create the output.
2882.971 And that is because in that
state, you're still sleepy,
2886.51 you're still fatigued,
you're not even awake
2889.721 the whole level at this point.
2892.84 Well, that is still an actual
phenomenon that happens that,
2899.29 a lack of recovery, or
lack of wakefulness,
2902.32 or whatever you want to say
2903.43 is going to lead to a
decreased output there.
2905.47 So when you start to measure
that on a daily basis,
2908.26 you can get a pretty good
sense of where you're at.
2909.88 And I think when people
start to see a drop off
2912.07 of 10% or so, or even
greater of their grip output,
2917.26 you really should skip the gym that day.
2919.27 Because I don't think there's
much you're going to do there
2920.971 that's going to be that beneficial,
2923.38 even if it is the day to train
legs or whatever day it is.
2926.89 - I love this tool, it's
simple, it's low cost,
2929.74 if you can find such a scale.
2931.27 I guess you could also find
one of those grippers that,
2933.46 and you could do this in a
very non quantitative way,
2935.745 but better would be a scale
where you could actually measure
2938.98 how hard you can squeeze this
thing at a given time of day.
2942.375 It draws to mind, just a
little neuroscience factor,
2945.13 in the world of circadian neurobiology,
2947.56 one of the consistent findings is that
2950.14 in the middle of your nighttime,
2952.21 they'll wake people up and
they'll say, do this test.
2954.69 In the laboratory they
use a different apparatus,
2957.01 but it's essentially the same thing.
2958.63 And in the middle of the night
2959.463 grip strength is very, very low.
2961.06 And mid-morning, grip strength is high,
2963.28 and as the body temperature
goes up into the afternoon,
2965.74 grip strength goes higher
and higher and higher,
2966.573 and then it drops off.
2967.96 There's this circadian
rhythm and grip temperature.
2969.91 So you probably want to do this
2970.81 at more or less the same time each day
2973.03 if you're going to use it.
2973.863 But it I think it's
brilliant in its simplicity
2976.84 and it's directness to
these upper motor neurons,
2979.06 'cause that's really what
it's assessing your ability.
2981.25 Again, it's about the ability
to contract the muscles hard.
2983.68 If you can't do that,
2984.513 you're not going to get
an effective workout.
2985.88 - Yeah, and they also, I mean,
2986.8 there certainly are more
sophisticated tools too.
2988.9 As PT, we have hand grip dynamometers,
2993.13 we can measure one side at a time too.
2995.587 I'm not really, I'm getting
a little bit blinded
2998.65 by the fact that both hands
are squeezing into that scale
3000.84 and I don't get really
a left right comparison.
3003.03 But even at that level,
3003.9 that could give you a
little bit more detail,
3005.25 but that comes with a cost,
3006.18 those are pretty expensive devices.
3007.59 But if it's, listen,
if you were an athlete,
3009.337 the $200, $300 it cost
to have one of those
3012.862 would be well worth the added investment.
3015.652 - And I'm sure some of our
listeners will want one too,
3017.97 'cause there are a lot
of tech geeks out there,
3020.256 not tech industry geeks, but
people who like tech gear.
3024.48 What's it called again?
3025.32 - It's a hand grip dynamometer.
3026.79 - Hand grip dynamometer.
- Dynamometer.
3029.523 Said by Jeff with a
great East Coast accent,
3032.25 and by me in a terrible
botched at West Coast version.
3036.09 Thank you, well, I'll put
that in the show notes also.
3039.39 Now I think recovery is key,
we always hear about sleep.
3042.99 You grow when you sleep and
incidentally your brain,
3045.48 you stimulate learning when
you're awake obviously,
3048.27 but the reordering of neural
connections happens in sleep.
3051.24 This is why sleep is
the way to get smarter,
3053.64 provided you're also
doing the learning part.
3055.53 The sleep's the way to get stronger
3056.7 provided you're also
doing the training part.
3058.56 You've had some really,
3059.79 you've put out interesting
content over the years
3061.74 in terms of even sleep position.
3064.38 One of the major changes that
I made to my sleep behavior
3068.34 is to not have the sheets
tucked in at the end of the bed.
3071.67 And I'll tell you,
3072.503 this had a profound
impact on several things.
3074.13 First of all,
3074.963 my feet have always been
the bane of my existence,
3076.62 broke them a bunch skateboarding.
3078.307 And I noticed when I'd
run, I'd get shin splints.
3081.39 And then I started to
notice that my feet sort of,
3084.75 you're the PT, they were kind of floppy,
3086.622 as if I was pointing my toes
slightly all the time at rest.
3090.312 And I realized that based on
listening to you previously,
3094.53 that my sheets were wrapped
tight, not hotel tight.
3096.985 - Right.
3098.1 - What their thing in the hotels.
3099.271 And I started releasing the
sheets at the end of the bed,
3103.68 and I also started doing
some tibialis work.
3105.957 Front of Shin's work
essentially, changed everything.
3109.92 My back pain from running
my shin splints disappeared,
3112.89 my posture improved,
3113.91 although my audience will tell me
3115.777 that it still needs improvement.
3116.61 They're always five or 10 people that-
3118.5 I've actually had chairs
sent to our mailing address.
3121.56 Very nice chairs, right?
3122.58 So I'm trying there.
3125.4 But this is fascinating, right?
3127.035 The position that one sleeps in,
3129.75 I fortunately have never
had any shoulder issues
3132.12 knock on wood, but maybe you could just
3134.07 talk to us a little bit about
sleep and sleep position
3137.88 for sake of waking position and movement.
3139.817 'Cause this, I think is a very unique
3142.14 and very powerful way
to think about sleep.
3144.762 This podcast has done
a lot of episodes about
3147.45 keeping the room cool,
3148.71 getting sunlight in your eyes, et cetera,
3149.97 how to get into sleep.
3151.62 But you've talked about physically,
3154.47 what positions might
be better to sleep in.
3156.54 So please, please enrich us.
3159.45 - I mean, first of all,
3161.04 some people's opinions of
that type of content is that,
3164.678 you sleep in the position
that's most comfortable
3167.55 so you ensure that you're sleeping.
3169.26 Oh great, I understand
that we all want to sleep,
3172.11 that's the goal when we
put our head on the pillow,
3173.46 is to actually fall asleep
and wake up in the morning
3175.14 and not know what the hell
happened, unless you had a dream.
3176.91 But you know beyond that,
3179.04 there are certainly physical
components to sleep.
3182.49 That is why a lot of times
people will wake up and say like
3185.493 that you can incur pretty
serious injuries in sleep.
3188.73 People will wake up and
have like a shoulder
3190.65 that did not bother them at all,
3192.3 be humming the next day
or even for weeks after,
3195.75 because of the one sleep
position they put themselves in,
3198.03 in a prolonged way.
3199.53 And they happened to have a deep sleep,
3200.82 even through the discomfort.
3202.556 That can do actually some damage.
3205.83 So it's understandable
that the body can incur
3208.71 some strain and stress if you're
sleeping in the wrong way.
3211.71 One of the things I say
right off the bat is,
3213.93 sleeping on your stomach
3214.83 just doesn't really have many benefits.
3216.81 You're putting yourself
into a position that is,
3220.83 depending upon the
orientation of your mattress
3225.15 or how many pillows you're using,
3226.47 but you're basically
putting yourselves into
3228.66 excessive extension of the lumbar spine,
3231.72 which for most people, isn't very good,
3233.76 if you're a disc patient, I
guess that might be helpful,
3237.721 for relocating the disc.
3239.37 But I mean, for the most part,
3240.795 your hands are then
usually not at your sides,
3243.54 but they're up under your arms,
3244.89 so you've got them into
sort of internal rotation up
3247.11 over elevation in your head.
3248.52 It's just not a great position.
3250.2 You also have to crank your
neck for one side or the other
3252.21 in order to breathe, or you're
going to your face down,
3254.43 straight into the pillow.
3255.54 So I would skip that one.
3257.73 And there's some people that
are total belly sleepers.
3260.52 And I would just say, listen,
3262.05 I don't think that is the most helpful,
3265.08 long term way for you to sleep.
3266.55 Try to adopt a different position.
3268.388 Sleeping on your side oftentimes is,
3272.46 is also brought along with that,
3274.38 the legs knees coming
up towards the chest,
3276.96 prolonged hip flexion.
3278.07 Listen, we're doing enough
of that during the day.
3280.246 - What we're doing right now.
3281.82 - We don't need to do another 10 hours
3283.2 or eight hours or something
at night like that.
3285.15 And it just is reinforcing,
and as we said too,
3289.339 let's say you trained that day,
3291.54 you're just reinforcing
muscle shortening overnight.
3294.194 Where the body is healing
and trying to create
3297.33 some changes in your body.
3299.984 One of the reasons why
I recommend stretching
3302.46 or static stretching
prior to going to bed,
3304.694 a lot of people don't really
want to do it at that point,
3306.36 'cause it could take 10
minutes, 5-10 minutes,
3308.61 depending upon how many
muscles you have to stretch.
3310.23 But it's good to sort of try to establish
3313.23 just longer length temporarily
3315.24 prior to going into a state where
you're going to be not moving
3318.21 and recovering and creating
new changes in the muscle.
3322.53 So, that kind of, I don't
say it doesn't rule out
3327.54 the side sleeper.
3328.65 The side sleeper could
be very, very helpful
3330.36 for somebody that has
apnea or other conditions.
3333.99 So again, it's not an
all or nothing approach,
3336.72 but it's something that you
need to pay attention to.
3340.237 When you are on your back,
3341.91 like you were talking about
3342.957 and your feet are wedged
underneath a tight sheets
3347.46 at the end of the bed.
3348.3 And most of us, unless we
consciously are pulling them up,
3351.63 don't prefer our beds to
have really loose sheets
3353.67 at the end of the bed.
3354.503 - It's hard to make
the bed in the morning.
3356.04 - So it's like you you're going
to want to have them tight.
3359.37 Well, I'm saying as you experienced,
3361.74 you're going to have these
prolonged plant reflection,
3367.17 that's going to likely lead
to shorter calves over time
3372.267 because you're lacking all that length
3374.85 for that long period of
time that you could have
3376.98 if you just loosened up the sheets
3378.69 and allowed your feet to
just hang out where they are.
3381.15 Now, the resting position of the ankle
3383.16 is not endorse reflection,
3384.33 it's going to be still
in some plain reflection,
3386.04 but not being driven down
3387.54 and pulled down into that position.
3389.07 And I think what happens
actually is people who get
3392.07 uncomfortable that way,
even in their sleep
3394.71 will shift away from that
3396.09 by turning either onto
their side of their stomach.
3397.89 So there's definitely an
impact of the body position
3401.16 and sleep in figuring out the best way
3403.62 that you can still sleep of
course, and get your rest,
3406.62 but have a mindful eye towards
what it's doing to your body
3409.38 and choose the one that's
least abrasive to your body
3413.46 is the way you should go.
3415.05 - That's terrific, and again,
it's really helped me and
3418.913 I'm a big believer based on good science
3421.83 out of Stanford and elsewhere that
3424.77 as much as we can be
nasal breathers in sleep,
3426.81 we probably should be.
3427.643 I don't know if you've
done any content yet about
3430.68 taping the mouth shut
with some medical tape,
3432.39 but you know the benefits
of nasal breathing in sleep
3435.33 are pretty tremendous,
3436.163 but it takes a little bit of
training for people to do,
3438.12 and the training is very simple.
3439.32 It's a little piece of medical tape.
3441.06 So again, a topic for another time.
3444.15 I'm glad you mentioned stretching,
3445.38 I was going to ask about
stretching a little bit later,
3446.94 but let's talk about stretching.
3448.473 When's the best time to stretch
3450.78 for particular types of results?
3453.39 And maybe you could define
3454.23 some of the different types of stretching.
3455.781 So you just mentioned a little bit of,
3457.98 what you call it, light stretching or?
3460.985 I'm completely naive here on stretching.
3463.86 So let me just say, I
can think of stretching
3465.33 where I hold the stretch and
really try and "lengthen"
3469.59 in air quotes folks, I don't
want the PTs jumping all over.
3472.35 I don't know what it is,
3473.183 but nutrition and the
PTs online are really,
3475.53 they've got pitchforks in both hands.
3477.24 Academics...
3478.7 - That's a recent evolution, I think.
3480.441 And not the nutrition as much,
3482.241 but the PTs have become a
little bit angry these days.
3484.05 - I see, well, I always say
with feelings of powerlessness
3486.66 comes aggression.
3487.94 Remember that folks.
3489.57 So in any case, they're
stretching where I'm
3494.316 trying to consciously
"lengthen," again in air quotes,
3499.47 the muscle I'm not yanking on the limb
3502.26 or bobbing up and down.
3503.37 Maybe you could define the
different types of stretching
3504.96 for people, maybe give
us some rough guidelines
3507.33 about what or not to do if cold or warm,
3508.98 before training, after
training, et cetera.
3511.11 - So, yeah, there's obviously
3512.88 there's a lot of different
types of stretching
3514.44 that could get even to P and F stretching
3516.84 and things that are a
little bit more niche.
3519.99 But in general, the two
basic forms of stretching
3522.9 are active stretching
and passive stretching,
3524.91 and your dynamic work.
3528.486 And your passive stretching is done
3530.676 with the goal of trying
to create an increase
3533.946 in the flexibility of the muscle.
3537.27 So whether you're actually
increasing the length
3539.37 of that muscle, more
so what you're doing is
3541.59 increasing the- or decreasing
the resistance of that muscle
3544.5 to want to stay at a certain
level of flexibility.
3547.92 So when we can sort of take the breaks off
3550.62 and allow that muscle to
allow us more range of motion,
3554.34 we're inherently increasing flexibility
3556.26 without necessarily having
to increase the length
3558.18 of that muscle.
3560.4 That is usually done at a time
far away from your workout,
3563.91 because they have shown where
3565.65 this type of stretching
done prior to an activity,
3568.74 and it could be like a
structured activity like lifting,
3573.69 or it could be a little
bit less structured,
3575.76 like competing in a sport
in a spontaneous type way,
3579.39 that there is a period of
recalibration that is needed
3584.34 after doing this,
3585.66 because you're disrupting the
length tension relationship
3587.447 of the muscle that causes
you to not necessarily
3591.81 be able to rely on these,
I've talked about before,
3594.6 stored motor engrams in
your mind in terms of,
3597.24 this is the pattern for how
I swing a golf club, say.
3600.004 And now introducing a
little bit of flexibility,
3603.9 or added flexibility, or range,
3605.43 because of the stretching I did before,
3607.41 it takes maybe a whole or two
or three to match up again.
3611.538 Oh, this is what he's trying to do,
3613.86 that golf swinging thing
that I remembered again,
3615.9 like it's not remembering
that every component,
3618.33 like I have to bend my
right wrist back 10 degrees,
3621.477 and then I have to bend my
elbow and I have to break,
3623.34 like your body stores these
patterns for motor efficiency.
3626.01 And when I have to start
matching up that stored pattern
3629.58 with what's feeling new
because of the increased range,
3632.367 I can impair performance.
3633.87 And again, it could happen
even in a gym workout
3636.24 where you're talking about your first,
3637.26 second set, third set,
3638.681 where maybe the
repercussions aren't as big,
3641.28 'cause I'll just do a few extra sets.
3643.14 But in performance, if you screw
up your first three rounds,
3645.27 you're playing on a PJ tour and you shoot
3646.74 your six over after three, you're done.
3649.77 So I think it matters there.
3651.92 As far as the dynamic, so we
relegate that as I mentioned,
3656.16 sort of towards the end of the day
3657.12 when it's not going to impact performance,
3659.31 but even maybe have the
additional benefit of creating
3663.171 the feeling of length or
the increase or decrease
3666.9 in resistance to this length
3668.646 at a time when I know
my body is going to try
3671.4 to tend to heal and heal shorter,
3673.41 never longer, but heal shorter.
3674.94 So if I can introduce a little
bit of that extra length
3677.88 or decreased resistance to that length,
3680.1 it's a better time to do it.
3681.27 So I think it promotes a better recovery.
3684.68 If I want to...
3686.25 - Sorry to interrupt, but so
stretching later in the day,
3688.728 because I'm intrigued by
this concept of heal shorter.
3693.09 So part of the healing
and recovery process
3694.86 means the shortening of the muscles.
3696.03 This is the tensing up in sleep.
3696.863 - Yes, yeah.
- Could you elaborate
3698.61 just a bit on that and then
sorry to break your flow,
3700.53 but then to continue...
3701.363 - No, just basically,
what's been shown is that,
3704.07 when the repair process,
muscular repair from,
3708.33 let's say strength
training during the day,
3710.16 the repair process usually
results in a muscle
3712.47 that is slightly shorter rather
than increased in length.
3716.19 It's just, muscles prefer to sort of
3719.49 ratchet their way down
into that contraction,
3723.54 and then maintain that more comfortable
3727.17 length tension relationship.
3728.4 So when you're sleeping,
3729.99 it tends to air on the side of shorter
3732.51 rather than longer, when ideally
we don't really want that.
3735.09 We want to maintain as much of that length
3738.0 because with more length, we
actually have more leverage.
3741.39 That muscle has more leverage to contract.
3743.28 If it was all the way contracted,
3744.84 you really can't obviously
we know generate much force
3747.0 in a muscle that's already
maximally contracted.
3749.64 So I think we want to do something
that we, whatever we can,
3753.9 whatever little weapons
we have in our arsenal
3755.73 that could allow us to
do this prior to sleep.
3759.57 And again, it's just making
it a conscious choice
3762.42 to do it at a time of the day
3763.41 that makes a little bit more sense.
3766.02 Dynamic stretching is really
not done for that purpose
3768.78 of trying to create any
type of feeling of act
3774.03 or increasing the potential length
3776.4 as you said of the muscle,
3777.45 but more so the readiness
of the muscle to perform.
3780.12 And increasing exploring the
ends of that range of motion
3784.4 in a more dynamic way so
you're not hanging out there
3787.62 in disrupting that length
tension relationship
3789.387 but just sort of touching
the ends of those barriers
3792.84 so that when you feel movement
again, it feels looser,
3796.38 it feels more ready.
3797.43 And obviously at the same
time warming up blood flow,
3800.88 all the benefits we get from
just warming up in general.
3803.61 So like that's the series
3805.62 you've probably seen a
bunch of times but like
3807.524 leg swings and butt kicks
and lunge, walking lunges
3813.09 and all types of-
- Toe touches.
3814.89 - Toe touches, all those kind of drills,
3816.84 those active stretching drills
3817.98 or lunging with rotations
for the upper body
3821.01 to try to get some of the
thoracic spine involved too.
3823.2 Those are the drills that
people will do prior to training
3826.11 that are both excitatory
3827.67 in terms of just the nervous system
3829.41 but also helpful for just
the general warm up the body
3832.59 'cause the blood flow.
3833.64 But from a muscle readiness standpoint
3835.44 not impairing the performance
3838.47 while at the same time
exploring the increased ranges
3841.44 'cause as you know the
first toe touch you do
3844.17 is not as high as the
last toe touch you do.
3845.547 - For me it doesn't even include the toe.
3847.819 - The shin touch.
- The touch attempt.
3850.71 - So like those are going to improve
3852.78 with each subsequent rep
3854.43 and I think that's what people actually,
3856.56 when you can see those,
3858.0 those actual changes from
rep one to rep seven,
3861.63 you just feel ready,
3862.5 you feel more alert and
ready to go in your workout.
3865.23 So the dynamic type of stretching
and I mentioned earlier on
3869.137 what I've had to do to sort
of increase my warm up focus.
3873.21 I think that's more of what
I try to do these days.
3875.496 I try to be a little bit
more alert to the fact that,
3879.241 my body's not ready.
3880.65 When I was working with
Antonio Brown I remember like
3882.72 he would spend 20 minutes, 30
minutes on all dynamic work.
3886.995 And I've never seen
anybody spend that long
3889.62 on their dynamic work.
3890.67 But like he said, he just
didn't feel right and ready
3894.66 to go unless he did a lot of that.
3896.97 And I mean his dynamic stretching routine
3900.21 would be a workout for most everybody.
3902.555 And it's crazy how much he did.
3904.62 - These pro athletes are amazing.
3906.18 And you've had the great
fortune of working with
3908.97 and improving their abilities.
3912.18 But I can only imagine
3913.95 'cause I also imagine he is
pretty strong in the gym also.
3916.71 - I mean, it always amazes me
3919.14 the guys that make it to that level
3920.52 no matter what sport they do.
3922.627 They're so gifted in everything.
3924.42 Like David Wright used to
make me laugh all the time
3927.33 with the Mets because no matter what I,
3931.02 Ping pong, like anything
3933.03 because of his hand-eye coordination.
3934.5 Like anything great at.
3937.14 Jump rope.
3937.973 I remember he hadn't
done a lot of jump rope
3939.395 and I think jump rope's
one of the best things
3943.23 you could do from a
conditioning standpoint.
3944.91 It's actually fairly
interesting, it's not just,
3947.556 it's not too harsh on the joints
3951.09 even though it's a ballistic
move and he wasn't-
3954.45 I have to admit, if he listens to this,
3956.25 he's going to want to kill me,
3957.083 but I was better at him at jump roping.
3959.46 One of the only things I could do.
3960.508 And then I gave him about five days
3962.91 and he completely blew me out of the water
3964.71 to the point where I could
never keep up with him anymore.
3966.9 He made it look effortless.
3968.28 It's like that's where the
athlete in someone comes out.
3971.16 No matter what they pick
up, they're good at it.
3973.35 And I think that when you
see guys like this in the gym
3975.63 like their strength levels
tend to be pretty damn good
3977.7 and their abilities, their
coordination, their everything
3981.0 just tends to sort of
be good at that level.
3982.8 And it sort of amazes me.
3984.39 Why those guys can go pick up
a golf club and go shoot 72
3988.288 and having never really played.
3990.923 They're just naturally
good at whatever they do.
3993.96 - Yeah, I have a couple,
3994.8 I'm smiling 'cause I have a
couple really close friends
3997.5 who did a number of years
3998.82 some several decades in the SEAL teams.
4000.8 And I don't know that their
skill level at everything
4003.35 is so high as you're
describing for athletes
4005.57 but their level of
competitiveness is beyond.
4008.51 I ocean swam with one,
4009.59 there's no chance that I'm
going to right out swim Pat
4012.38 ever, ever.
4013.49 He actually goes back and forth sometimes
4015.02 just to check up on
me, which I appreciate.
4017.51 Thank you Pat.
4018.95 I haven't drowned yet.
4020.12 But in addition to that,
we could play horseshoes
4023.57 and it's like this switch
that just flips on,
4025.67 like he's going to murder me.
4027.412 Of course he's a very nice guy, right?
4028.64 In general, they tend to be very nice.
4029.84 But the level of competitiveness
is kind of unreal.
4032.54 They're selected for it.
4033.44 - They're trying to beat themselves
4034.43 they're not even trying to beat you.
4035.33 - That's right, I'm not
even in the competition.
4036.836 - You're not even there.
- Yeah, exactly.
4038.99 Thank you.
4040.784 Now I won't feel so bad or worse.
4044.06 It's true, it's a remarkable thing.
4045.44 I'm glad you mentioned jump roping.
4046.73 I used to skip rope for warmup for boxing,
4049.876 like three minute rounds
or something like that.
4053.356 But I'm glad you brought it up because
4056.066 skipping rope is something that
4058.466 obviously has a cardiovascular component,
4060.65 there's the conditioning
component, there's timing
4062.36 and it is kind of interesting, right?
4064.19 It's frustrating when you don't get it
4065.901 especially when it whips you on the air
4067.16 if you're using a proper rope.
4068.51 I'm just curious if you
could just give us a quick
4070.85 skipping rope 101.
4071.71 Do you like to see people
jumping with both feet and toes?
4074.81 We'll link to a video if
there was one and I missed it.
4077.72 Do you like to see
people doing high knees?
4079.16 Do you like people
basically like shuffling?
4081.98 You want to see people doing double Dutch?
4083.24 What do you want to see
people doing over time?
4085.52 - All of the above maybe
not the double Dutch,
4087.26 but all of the above.
4088.37 I mean, I think that's the
cool thing about it, right?
4090.59 Like once we sort of master
the skill 'cause for all of us,
4093.38 that first jump with the
two feet going together
4096.38 is a challenge.
4097.213 'Cause you just got to time that rope,
4098.51 you got to time your jump
4099.68 and then we get bored as
we often do as humans,
4102.32 we get bored with what we can do
4103.307 and we want to take on new challenges
4104.99 so then it becomes one leg at a time
4106.61 or then it becomes side
to side hops, right?
4109.52 All of those things are
beneficial I believe
4112.73 neurologically to enhancing the ability
4114.65 to do the skill as a whole
but also just because
4118.01 I'm such a believer in
training in all three planes.
4121.01 So like just doing straight up and down
4123.62 versus now I can do frontal
plane side to side motion
4126.71 and then I can even do small little twists
4128.78 or core screws you call them.
4130.247 It requires a different,
4131.84 you would know more better than I do
4133.103 that it requires different
neurological patterns
4136.61 to be able to coordinate
that because you're changing
4139.25 the orientation of your body in space.
4140.72 So it's not just them
changing the exercise
4143.12 but I'm changing how my body
interprets that exercise
4146.0 because what's happening
to my body in space.
4147.95 So I love whatever people wind up doing,
4152.33 but I am amazed there are people,
4155.57 I just started following
this young woman on Instagram
4157.79 who is like, I'll give her a plug out,
4161.294 I think it's like @anna.skips or something
4162.35 and she is ridiculous.
4164.96 Like I watch her and I'm like mesmerized
4167.0 at what she can do with the rope.
4168.62 It's like is an extremely
athletic endeavor
4171.71 believe when it gets to be at that level
4173.27 and the speed and the precision and the-
4177.071 I think one of the goals that
you want to be able to have is
4179.949 to where you're feeling
as if you're almost
4182.514 effortlessly dancing without a rope.
4185.27 Like where you're just
bouncing off of the ball
4187.22 of your foot.
4188.359 And it's an important skill to learn too
4191.0 whether you go back to run
or even even jog, right?
4195.5 Just like more casual running,
4197.72 learning how to land is so important.
4200.33 One of the drills that
people should try is like,
4203.51 try to jump on your heels.
4205.28 So just stand up, pull your
toes off the ground, right?
4207.95 And just jump from your
heels and land on your heels.
4210.59 You'll feel it in your jaw.
4212.15 You'll literally feel your jaw rattle
4213.74 when you land on your heels.
4214.88 There is no shock absorption capabilities
4216.98 through your heels.
4217.94 Meantime, a lot of people
land on their heels a lot
4221.42 when they run and you're just,
4223.46 your body's not built to absorb the forces
4225.59 like the ball of your foot could.
4227.0 It's really built as a spring.
4229.01 And the foot is a, to me
as a physical therapist,
4231.98 the foot has always been
one of the most amazing,
4233.78 you talk about having
bad feet I have flat feet
4236.42 it looks like I got flippers
if I took my shoes off.
4239.03 Like I'm wearing scuba fins.
4241.151 There is no-
4243.11 There is no adaptability of
that foot to the surface.
4247.31 When it's completely caved
and flattened like that,
4250.22 the job of the foot is to be a adaptable.
4253.4 Well, maybe there is some adaptability
4255.26 because it's so floppy, but
at the same time at some point
4258.14 that critical junction when
you're going to then step through
4260.69 and you need to be able to push off
4262.55 the foot has to actually
changes in the midfoot itself
4265.7 to become a rigid lever
is what they call it.
4268.37 You're going from a mobile
adapter to a rigid lever.
4271.64 That rigid lever literally
locks up the metatarsal joint
4274.79 to become solid
4276.62 so that you can push
off of it with leverage.
4278.99 If you lack that capability,
4281.03 all those stresses that are
supposed to be born by the foot,
4283.7 go up into the ankle, into
the knee, into the hip,
4285.86 into the low back.
4287.06 So learning how to land and
start to train your body
4292.123 to experience ground
reaction forces the right way
4296.444 is so critical to all other function
4300.197 and all other disability
of the kinetic chain
4303.17 and jumping rope is like
one of the best ways
4305.39 to learn how to do that.
4306.44 - Great.
4307.49 I own a jump rope I love
doing it in the morning
4310.43 while I get sunlight in my eyes.
4311.87 It's actually a protocol I
picked up from Tim Ferris
4315.68 who mentioned 'cause
listeners in my podcast know
4318.41 I'm like a broken record with
get sunlight in your eyes
4321.17 even through cloud cover it's
just sets your sleep rhythms
4323.99 and your waking rhythms
of yada yada on and on.
4326.657 But sometimes it'd be
kind of boring for people
4329.3 and I want to get them off their phone.
4330.5 So jumping rope is also
just a great way to wake up.
4332.75 So jumping rope can be the cardio workout,
4337.727 the 15, 30 minutes.
- Definitely.
4340.04 And there's sort of that hybrid
4341.18 that we were talking about before of like,
4343.436 you're not necessarily
dropping down to the ground
4345.65 and doing burpees,
4346.483 but I just look at it as
a more athletic endeavor
4349.07 because of the coordination involved
4350.9 than just simply walking or jogging.
4353.15 - Yeah, and it's not much
of equipment requirement.
4356.42 Very minimal cost.
4358.07 You could even use a rope
or something if you...
4361.37 - We even instruct people
they could use no rope
4363.77 and just pretend and just
move the arms, right?
4366.77 - Truly zero cost.
4368.037 - You're never going to
hit the rope which is good
4369.14 but at the same time,
4370.13 So you're never going to know
if you're doing it wrong,
4371.66 but at least you can move through that
4373.58 and get the same benefits
through the feet.
4375.29 - I love it, I love it.
4376.861 I told myself before
sitting down with you today
4380.0 that I wasn't going to
focus on specific exercises
4382.61 because there's such a
wealth of incredible content
4385.37 that you put out there
4386.203 that people could just put
into YouTube or elsewhere
4388.4 and arrive at the proper
way to do a chin or a dip,
4392.24 for whatever purpose.
4393.44 But there's one exercise
and one particular motion
4396.92 that I'd like to discuss for a moment
4399.38 because I believe that
4401.163 learning about this
cautionary note from you
4404.674 is one of the reasons
4406.82 that I've maintained steady
training for 30 years
4409.97 with no major injury knock on wood
4413.06 and that's the upright row.
4415.738 One thing that whether
you weight train or not.
4418.93 - Do we censor this podcast?
4420.862 I mean censoring, do we
beep this out or not?
4421.97 - I do.
4423.13 Do you get beef about this?
- No.
4426.448 You know what, we always get beef
4428.6 in any social media platform
where we're put out.
4430.76 But like, no, I guess
some, I get some from it,
4432.89 but I'm fully prepared to defend myself.
4436.012 - But here's the reason
for asking about this.
4438.47 I never really cared much for upright rows
4440.84 it's not an exercise I tend to do.
4442.34 But one thing that's apparent
in all my colleagues,
4445.34 in every child I see, in
every adult I see is that
4448.37 almost everybody is in
inward rotation now.
4451.298 So folks think if you stay,
4452.93 I think I learned this from you also,
4454.19 if you stand up straight
4455.12 and then you just point your thumbs out,
4456.762 like a thumbs up but your hands are down
4459.59 you're pointing your thumbs straight out,
4461.33 ideally they would go straight out.
4463.1 Most people the thumbs
4464.06 are going to be pointing
toward one another
4465.14 because most people are starting
to look somewhere between
4469.486 a non human primate and a melted candle.
4475.575 Bent at the hips, et cetera,
from too much sitting,
4478.7 we're all sitting, we're
in an inward rotation,
4480.92 but I learned from you
that the upright row
4483.5 compromises some important
aspects of our shoulder mechanics
4488.18 and could be actually sort
of a dangerous movement
4490.31 in some ways.
4491.143 I'm sure there's a safe
way for people to do it.
4493.04 But so I've always made it a point now
4495.77 on the basis of this advice
to A, not do upright rows,
4499.79 but I wasn't doing them before
4500.72 but to really strive for external rotation
4504.32 on things like bench dips, on
a number of different things.
4507.35 Whenever I can I try and
go into external rotation
4509.87 provided that without looking
like an idiot walking around
4512.03 with my palms facing outward.
4513.77 Please tell us about
internal external rotation.
4517.7 The upright row is one aspect of that,
4520.1 but why this is so important
not just for weight training,
4523.73 but as in terms of posture and mechanics
4526.4 and not looking like a melted candle
4529.73 or partially melted candle.
4531.74 - I actually love it.
4532.573 I'm happy to talk about it
cause I love the shoulder
4536.75 as a joint.
4537.583 I think PTs tend to fall
in love with certain areas
4539.93 and the shoulder is one
of the cool areas for me,
4541.79 it's like the foot is but like,
4543.59 the shoulder has the most
mobility in the body of any joint,
4547.91 but it's also got the
least stability, right?
4549.53 There's always that trade off
of mobility and stability.
4552.14 So your stability comes
from certain muscle groups
4557.72 and 101 is that the only muscle group
4559.97 that actually externally
rotates the shoulder
4562.04 is going to be the rotator cuff, okay.
4563.69 And unless you are devoted to training
4566.21 through external rotation
and exercises that
4568.97 are going to externally
rotate the shoulder,
4571.43 you're not training that function.
4573.68 And it's so easy for us in everyday life
4577.04 especially those that aren't training
4578.63 to not ever really undergo
any of those stresses
4581.48 that could be beneficial to counteracting
4583.58 what happens freely and naturally,
4585.83 which is internal rotation.
4587.15 So when you think about
the imbalance created
4589.16 just by nature and how we live our lives,
4591.47 internal rotation far, far, far
outweighs external rotation.
4595.88 So you need to address it.
4597.65 And the reason why you need
to address it is because
4599.48 you need to normalize those
biomechanics to the shoulder
4602.27 if you want their long term health.
4603.77 And one of the functions of the shoulder
4605.48 is to raise our arm up over our head.
4607.4 And if we do that from an
internally rotated position,
4610.324 we're going to have a higher likelihood
4613.33 of creating stress inside that joint.
4615.8 Funny thing is I talked
about before my PT brethren
4618.59 who can be somewhat angry these days,
4621.71 I don't know what
happened, but fairly angry.
4623.96 They want to discredit the
existence of something like
4627.89 shoulder impingement,
which I don't know how,
4631.85 I mean, certain studies,
look, we both all read studies
4634.61 and studies will say one thing one day
4637.01 and potentially conflict entirely
in a different direction.
4639.77 Some studies will point
to the non-existence
4641.586 of a shoulder impingement.
4644.18 Meanwhile, we have thankfully
digital motion x-rays
4648.306 that will literally show the
impingement occur in real time,
4652.58 in real function.
4653.66 And that's one of the limitations
I'm off on a tangent here,
4655.61 but like those types of x-rays
4657.17 or that type of fluoroscopy
that we have nowadays,
4659.36 like gives us such insight
that we never had before
4661.85 'cause we're taking static x-rays
4663.32 of someone laying down on a table.
4665.12 Well, I want to see what happens
4666.17 when you actually raise my arm
up over my head in function
4668.87 and the tools now exist to do that.
4671.33 We see the problems occurring because
4674.36 in order to get normal mechanics
4676.85 and free up the joint maximally inside
4679.25 you need to externally rotate
as you raise the arm up.
4682.49 So if your muscles aren't firing
4684.56 and they're not necessarily as strong
4687.83 as the internal rotation
bias that pulls them in,
4690.83 you're asking for trouble
every time you do that.
4692.75 Well, this exercise is literally
putting you in elevation
4697.49 and internal rotation.
4698.48 And if you were to walk into
a PT office and someone said,
4701.277 "I think he's got impingement,
will you diagnose him?"
4703.55 There's a test called
a Hawkins Kennedy Test.
4705.47 And I would put you in the position
4707.3 I know we're not visible at
this point through the podcast,
4709.73 but I'll put you in this position here
4711.68 where I have your arm elevated
4713.42 and your hand pretty much under your chin
4715.94 pushing downward on that
4717.2 to create that internal shoulder rotation.
4719.0 Pretty much the exact
position that we're in
4720.8 when we're holding a
bar in an upright row.
4723.65 Some will say, well, just don't go so high
4725.66 going up to the level of the chest,
4726.98 but you're still in this
internally rotated position.
4729.89 The thing that I think
frustrates me the most
4731.93 about the exercise is
that I have an alternative
4735.32 and the alternative does the same thing
4736.85 in terms of helping the muscles grow
4738.95 by simply fixing the
biomechanics of the exercise
4741.16 by just allowing the hands
to go higher than the elbows.
4743.78 So instead of the elbows
being higher than the hand
4746.12 which drives you into internal rotation,
4748.13 if the elbow is lower than the hand,
4750.23 the hand being higher here,
I'm in external rotation.
4753.47 And I could do something
called a high pull
4755.63 and still get the same
abduction of the arm
4758.33 and still get the same
benefits of the shoulders,
4760.46 the delts and the traps
4761.72 without having to undergo
any of the stresses
4763.73 that would come from
4764.81 the somewhat awkward
movement of an upright row.
4767.72 - And for those listening,
4769.07 we'll put a link to a short
clip of what this looks like.
4771.53 But basically what Jeff is doing
4773.06 and tell me if I'm describing
this incorrectly or correctly.
4775.55 Jeff is taking your two thumbs
and pointing behind you,
4779.78 so elbows up kind of near the chin
4781.4 and pointing behind you
like, oh, headed that way.
4783.32 Like somebody directing the
airplane, like come back,
4785.3 come back and back.
4786.519 I forget what they call that.
4787.79 I think it's called semaphorin,
4789.59 is the action of like where
they direct the planes
4792.02 or something the flags or whatever.
4793.61 Someone will, of course tell
me I'm wrong about that too,
4795.89 which is why I say these things
4797.39 because I like being told
what the correct answer is.
4800.409 In any case, so this
replaces the upright row
4804.68 and probably does a number
4805.55 of other important things as well.
4807.35 - Well, again, listen, without
naming names or programs
4811.1 or anything like that.
4811.933 When I got involved in, when
I got involved in Athlean-X,
4815.873 when I first my online presence,
4819.602 there was a very, very,
very popular program
4823.34 that was out there that I just
for fun I wanted a as a PT,
4826.82 is the nerdy things we do,
4828.29 but I wanted to evaluate
the workout structure.
4832.76 And I went and I looked at every rep
4834.92 over the course of a week.
4836.39 And there was something
like 890 repetitions
4839.72 or something done
4841.231 and zero of them were
dedicated external rotation
4844.12 in the shoulder.
4845.24 So if you think about it, I mean,
4846.619 again, it was a very popular program
4847.76 that was done by a lot of people.
4849.139 There was no focus at all,
4851.24 no dedicated focus towards creating
4854.54 a balance to an action
that is so predominant.
4857.72 And remember, it's not just
because we sit with bad posture,
4860.87 but the fact that our chest
can internally rotate,
4865.01 our latch can internally rotate,
4866.81 there's like muscle, other
big muscles that participate
4869.39 in things that we do every day
4870.98 that will further internally
rotate the shoulder.
4873.71 The only weapons we have
for external rotation
4876.77 are those little rotator cuff muscles
4878.75 and three of them actually
three of the four.
4881.15 And the job is to sort of
4883.04 actively and consciously train them
4885.32 through really the
boring exercises, right?
4887.21 Like you've seen them with the band,
4888.62 you anchor a band to a pole,
4890.99 you stand with the band
in the opposite hand.
4893.18 So if it's anchored to
the pole on my left side
4895.16 I've got the band on my right side
4896.66 and you see people where they
kind of rotate their hand
4898.73 towards the back.
4899.66 Again, kind of what you were saying
4900.92 but at a lower elevation
taking the back of my hand
4903.86 and trying to point it
to somebody behind me.
4906.83 Well, that is one of the
ways to train the muscle.
4911.27 It's just a one function of the shoulder,
4913.01 external rotation of the
shoulder and you need to do it.
4916.46 And again, it's not that
4918.98 if somebody was doing more
external rotation work
4921.14 could they absorb the upright row better?
4924.23 Probably, because as
they elevated the arm,
4926.99 they probably have a little
bit more of a contribution
4930.8 from the rotator cuff to
what one of the functions is
4933.89 to centralize the head
of the humorous inside
4936.89 of the glenoid, the capsule.
4938.63 So as it rises up, it stays central
4942.05 as opposed to migrating up
4943.943 because the deltoid likes to pull up.
4946.52 So if the rotator cuff has
some ability to counteract
4950.24 the upward pull of a del
4952.19 then it can maintain a
more healthy relationship
4954.65 with overhead movement.
4955.7 So just realizing that that function
4957.92 is only gained through
doing these exercises,
4959.808 we would probably
dedicate more time there,
4963.746 the upright row might be
better absorbed by that person
4966.8 'cause they have a
little bit more strength.
4968.42 But again, why?
4970.07 Because if you have an exercise
that does the same thing
4972.8 for what you're trying to do muscularly,
4974.66 to build the muscles that it affects,
4976.76 why wouldn't you just do
it where you can still see
4978.925 actually pick up more
repetitions of external rotation?
4982.52 So you're getting none of
the harm all of the benefits.
4985.43 I see zero reason to
ever do the upright row
4988.55 and people will argue, this
is the way they argue that,
4991.1 I've done this for 30 years
and I've never hurt myself.
4993.98 And I always say yet, yet.
4996.95 Like, listen, the goal is
to not hurt yourself ever.
5001.0 So even if you, it's sort of
like the championship game.
5005.56 You might play the game of your life,
5007.33 but if you lose you lost.
5008.68 And when you get into the
end of the record books,
5010.78 you still lost.
5011.74 So even if you had the
game in your life you lost,
5013.913 I don't care if you do
it for 30 years, no pain,
5015.687 you're still doing it and there's no pain
5017.98 I'm giving you an option
5019.39 that's going to give you the same results
5021.28 in the exercise that you're seeking.
5022.75 That's why you're doing the exercise
5024.46 without the possibility of
having the the bad outcome
5027.91 come from it.
5028.78 So I get a little bit
defensive of the move,
5032.5 but I feel like it's like,
why would you do that?
5034.63 - No, it makes me say,
5035.463 being able to train for a long
period of time and feel good.
5039.25 I'm proud to say and I don't have
5042.01 the kind of genetics where
like we don't have a lot of
5044.02 impressive athletes in our
family tree or anything.
5046.6 It's some fit individuals
some less fit individuals,
5049.0 but I really believe
5049.96 it's about putting in the
work consistently over time.
5052.03 And the more often you can
wake up not in pain the better.
5056.742 And so I think that being
in external rotation
5061.06 as often as possible is good.
5062.17 This is actually a good friend
who's a yoga teacher told me
5065.103 this is also a problem with the yogis,
5067.248 all the downward dog stuff.
5068.89 For those listening,
5069.768 you can think of inward
rotation as like thumbs down.
5072.813 Just think thumbs down
and rotation isn't bad
5075.7 but less thumbs down more
thumbs up is external rotation.
5078.52 So for those just listening,
maybe that gives a visual.
5081.49 The more exercise you can
do in external rotation
5083.722 the better it seems on average.
5087.081 I'd love to chat with you
just a little bit more about
5090.82 biomechanics, and this is a
personal thing that again,
5096.76 your content really helped solve for me.
5099.55 One is I thought I had lower back pain,
5101.593 that I had sciatica so
badly that on a few trips
5105.691 Work trips years ago
5107.65 when I was doing a lot
more international travel.
5109.87 I mean, it was hard to stand up sometimes.
5111.327 I mean like excruciating pain.
5113.08 I didn't want to take medication,
5114.31 I didn't want to do back surgery.
5115.985 In the end, turns out it
wasn't a back injury at all.
5119.91 And one of the things that
helped fix it was this
5123.7 just learning about this
thing called the medial glute.
5126.31 And you had a video that
said fixed back pain
5129.52 and then you quite accurately say that
5131.8 some back pain isn't really
about the back at all.
5134.154 And had me do an exercise or
allowed me to try an exercise
5139.03 where I lay on my side and
essentially pointing my toe down
5143.86 the top toe down, almost
like pointing a toe down
5146.41 and then would slowly lift the leg up
5149.05 while pointing the toe down.
5150.94 Maybe I got it...
- No, you got it good.
5152.257 - And then holding that,
5153.697 and there's a muscle that sort of sits
5155.2 at the top of the glute
5156.19 it kind of peaks out
every once in a while.
5157.96 You can feel it there with your thumb,
5159.55 which is I think you had push back on it.
5161.68 A bit creating that mind muscle link again
5164.98 and there with proprioception,
5166.6 the actual feeling of a
muscle literally with a limb,
5170.68 we know based on the neural
circuits for movement,
5174.7 that that enhances the
contractibility of a muscle.
5177.58 So like if you touch your bicep,
5178.883 you literally can contract
it more more strongly.
5181.45 And this makes total sense based on
5183.308 neuromuscular physiology.
5186.73 So had me do that repeatedly.
5188.23 And I started doing that in my hotel room
5190.163 and the pain started to disappear.
5192.31 And then it came back again the afternoon
5193.84 so I did it again in the afternoon.
5195.37 So this is something I
did for three or four days
5197.59 and lo and behold a back pain's gone.
5199.838 I handed this off to my father
5202.33 because he like me has a
slightly lower right shoulder.
5204.97 I think that our gate is
probably thrown off by this.
5207.34 It's probably a genetic thing, who knows.
5209.425 He handed off to somebody.
5211.688 It turns out that we don't
suffer from back pain
5214.477 and in fact, now I don't
suffer from any pain
5216.31 because I was doing this exercise
5218.08 which I think is helping my medial glute.
5220.96 Two reasons why I raised this.
5222.16 One, I know a lot of guys who
have this right side sciatica
5225.64 'cause people keep the
wallet there is one idea
5228.34 or left side sciatica.
5229.566 There are a lot of people male and female
5232.21 who think they have back pain
5233.17 when they don't actually have back pain.
5234.61 And the other thing is that
5235.807 is a general question about biomechanics
5238.39 or statement about biomechanics.
5239.8 I had of a feeling
5241.42 that a lot of what people
think is back pain or knee pain
5244.15 or neck pain or headache or shoulder pain
5246.7 is actually the consequence
of something that's happening
5251.11 above or below that site of pain.
5253.75 And this is a whole landscape
of stuff related to PT
5258.01 and recovery and pain management.
5260.44 But maybe if you could just
educate us a bit on this
5263.29 and why this works, what
is the medial glute?
5266.02 Why did it make my so-called
back pain disappear?
5268.72 And how should people think about pain?
5271.06 And I'd like to use this as a segue
5272.23 to get into a little bit deeper discussion
5274.06 about pain and recovery.
5275.11 - Sure.
5275.943 So this is definitely like a
big cornucopia PT stuff here,
5280.6 but like and this is what I love.
5282.1 So first of all, that video,
5284.703 it's my proudest video that I have.
5287.287 And the reason being is that
it's helped so many people.
5290.65 Like we get comments on
that video every day.
5294.4 I don't even know how
many views it's got now,
5295.63 30 some what million.
5297.342 - We will link to it.
- There's a lot of views.
5299.89 And quite honestly,
5302.83 it was a little bit of
an afterthought video
5304.93 in terms of it's origin.
5307.6 I think that that day maybe
Jesse was having some problems
5311.02 or something like that, a
little bit of low back pain
5312.64 and I showed him and it helped
right away and he was like,
5315.31 well, we can make a video on it
5316.9 'cause this will help people.
5318.37 Not everybody, if you
have a real disc problem,
5320.743 it's not going to help
5322.0 because you're not changing
the structural problem
5324.82 that's there.
5325.96 But as you said, a lot of people don't
5328.3 and even disc issues a lot
of them are non-operative.
5331.69 So you'd want to try these things first.
5335.62 As far as what you're sort of experienced
5337.54 sometimes as that glute
medias really tightens down
5339.79 and that's again, from poor biomechanics
5342.46 up and down the kinetic chain,
5343.96 it can actually press on the sciatic nerve
5346.51 and give you what they
call a pseudo sciatica.
5349.06 Where it's not like you're making it up,
5352.69 it's not like you're not feeling that pain
5354.25 over that same sciatic distribution,
5356.38 but it's not caused from a disc,
5358.21 it's not caused from
something mechanical there,
5360.67 it's caused by the fact that this gluteus
5363.31 has posturely become a
problem for you or weak
5367.69 because you don't train it
and you need to address it.
5370.81 So, unlike any other muscle in the body,
5374.11 there are common trigger
points in common areas where
5377.68 the muscle will become
tightened or painful or spasmed
5381.79 and you can basically apply
pressure to these areas
5386.477 and then sort of thread that
muscle through the pressure
5390.52 by pushing down through there and then
5392.32 contracting the muscle which is why
5394.3 you go through that action of,
5396.168 I think we call it toast stabber,
5398.05 but like stabbing down and lifting up
5400.18 and stabbing down and lifting up.
5401.44 Taking that glute medias
through its function.
5404.05 So it's basically kind of working
5406.36 underneath the downward
pressure of the finger
5408.91 and that tends to help
you to almost need out
5413.5 what might be that trigger point.
5415.72 And that's why people can
see immediate relief there
5418.06 because once the trigger
point lets go, it feels like,
5422.08 and that's what the
comments are in that video.
5423.85 Like my God, I literally, I couldn't walk,
5425.98 I've been on my hotel floor,
I did this and I'm fixed.
5429.28 And meanwhile then it could come back
5431.53 because your body is like,
5432.38 well, I like being more like this.
5434.14 This is how I've been ingrained to be.
5437.74 So it might come back
5438.573 but then when you do another round of it
5440.62 and another round of it and
then finally it starts to say,
5442.117 all right, I'm not going
to do that anymore.
5443.47 It kind of eases up and
you can relieve yourself
5445.66 of those trigger points.
5446.745 You could do that up and down the back.
5449.56 There's other people that get that
5450.393 and that sort of inside
their shoulder blade,
5453.1 that same type of
cramping in another area.
5456.91 But once that takes place,
5460.12 well, then the job that
I think people have
5462.13 is like become educated that
5464.08 the glute medias is different
than the glute maximus.
5466.63 Like their functions are different.
5468.52 You have to work on not
just extending the hip
5472.27 but also abduction of the hip.
5474.01 External rotation of the hip,
same thing as in the shoulder.
5477.045 And this actually segues nicely into what,
5479.32 into the whole concept
you were talking about.
5480.76 Like the body is like a mirror image.
5482.89 The hip is like the shoulder, right?
5484.45 The ankle is the wrist.
5486.1 The foot is the hand.
5487.497 The knee is the elbow,
they're two hinge joints,
5490.57 they function that way.
5491.53 Well, with the shoulder, you've got that
5493.81 mobility that comes from having
all that freedom of motion
5497.17 but the stability is lacking.
5498.73 Well, the same thing with the
hip, like you've got mobility,
5501.52 but if you don't fully stabilize it
5503.5 by training all the muscles of the hip
5505.66 and if you don't strengthen
the external rotation
5508.06 of the hip, then you're
going to have issues.
5512.143 Like it's not biomechanically
going to work the same way.
5515.05 If you think of the body
as a series of bands
5518.779 pulling in different directions
5520.3 at different levels of tension,
5522.139 you're being pulled into
one direction or the other
5525.31 just by the balance of tension
5527.14 from one weak area to one
dominantly tight area.
5531.22 And you need to make sure that
5532.66 you can sort of balance this out
5534.46 in order to eliminate
some of the adaptations
5536.98 and compensations that happen.
5538.594 So what I say, when we look at
sort of the body as a whole,
5545.06 most often wherever
you're feeling the pain
5548.02 is absolutely not to blame.
5550.63 There's not to blame.
5551.53 It is somewhere above or
below as you hint to that.
5554.35 You're talking about, the knee
is my favorite example of it.
5558.07 Whenever you have knee
pain, patella tendonitis
5561.16 which I have forever.
5563.11 I've had bad, bad cases
of tendonitis where
5565.78 squatting is very difficult for me.
5567.949 It's not the knee, the knee is
literally a hinge joint that
5572.077 there's minor rotation
capabilities in the knee
5574.63 but it's a hinge joint.
5576.1 And it's being impacted
by the hip and the ankle
5580.27 and the foot, as I said before,
how critical the foot is.
5583.69 If you thought of the knee being
5586.433 like the middle of a train track,
5588.52 where the femur down your thigh
5590.41 and your shin down below your
knee, where the train track,
5593.83 well, what would happen if the
foot collapses at the bottom?
5596.77 All of a sudden that
train track on the bottom
5599.26 gets torqued just a little bit.
5601.072 Well, who's going to feel that the most,
5603.67 the area where it's torquing,
which is at the knee.
5605.74 So the stresses are going to be felt there
5607.21 meanwhile the problem is the foot
5608.8 or the problem is the ankle.
5610.27 People that are chronic ankle sprainers
5612.384 are almost always going to
wind up having back pain
5615.49 because the ankle sprain causes weakness
5618.01 in mal adaptations in the ankle
5619.78 that then gets connected
through the chain.
5621.88 Because now once I distort
the ankle and the shin,
5624.97 now the knee is trying to maintain
5627.16 its ability to hinge smoothly.
5629.47 So it toques on the femur to do that.
5632.17 Well, the femur is now
inside the hip joint
5633.97 pulling on the pelvis and
the pelvis is out of whack.
5636.88 It's really is fascinating.
5638.56 Like it's one of my favorite things about
5640.6 how the body works is like
how interconnected it is
5644.59 and how one little thing somewhere
5646.63 causes repercussion somewhere else.
5648.61 And the easiest way to find
out what your problem is,
5652.18 is to say, okay, I know
where my symptom is,
5654.13 but I got to find someone who can help me
5656.11 find the source somewhere else,
5657.91 because it is going to be
usually either above or below.
5660.49 Mostly, usually below
5661.66 'cause it usually translates
up the kinetic chain.
5663.97 But usually it's going to be
below where the real source is.
5666.88 So people with low back
pain usually have hip issues
5670.0 weaknesses, tightnesses,
flexibility issues,
5672.48 it's almost always below.
5675.1 When you get into really high
performance athletics though,
5678.429 it almost works the other way.
5680.2 Like where we have pitchers, who can't,
5683.47 I'm always fascinated by guys
that have Tommy John issues
5687.82 in their elbow, right?
5688.653 Pitchers.
5689.486 Like if you can't externally
rotate the shoulder
5693.04 that we talked about, again,
5694.09 the ability to get your shoulder back
5695.95 into external rotation.
5697.06 Well, your arm has to
get to a certain position
5701.14 for release of the baseball.
5702.97 And if it can't get there,
5704.31 if you can't externally rotate
the shoulder to get there
5706.93 then the elbow has to sort of torque more
5709.87 in order to allow the
arm to get back further.
5712.87 And it will try to take
some of that motion
5715.15 from a joint that's not really,
5716.53 again, it is the hinge joint,
really capable of doing that.
5719.92 So it starts to stress
that media level ligament
5722.26 to get a little bit further back
5723.73 because the shoulder's not working
5725.35 and that just ultimately
places strain on the elbow.
5727.87 So when you see a guy that has pain
5731.17 that floats around, a pitcher
that floats around their arm,
5734.32 all that is is sort of this
balance of compensation.
5736.87 Once his elbow starts hurting,
5738.82 then he can't get the
range from the elbow,
5741.91 so he tries to dig a
little bit further back
5744.13 into external rotation
5745.24 and then the rotator cuff gets inflamed
5746.8 and then he feels that's inflamed,
5748.57 and by the way, during that time period,
5749.59 it takes some of the strain off the elbow
5751.33 so the elbow feels better.
5752.53 Then he decides, okay, now
I got the extra rotation,
5755.11 but I'm getting too much of that
5756.4 so now he starts straining the elbow again
5758.29 and then keeps going through this cycle.
5759.91 So your body is very smart
5763.3 and it's going to compensate
every single time.
5765.76 It's going to find the compensation
5767.02 but there's no guarantee
that that compensation
5768.97 doesn't leave you with a
whole host of other issues.
5771.43 - Yeah, it's fascinating.
5772.883 In another lifetime, I
would've gone and been a PT
5775.75 although it sounds like the
community among PTs online...
5778.48 - I don't know what they,
5779.313 listen, we're good people but it's like...
5781.15 - Yeah, scientists and neuroscientists
5782.74 can get into pretty intense battles.
5784.691 Coming from the academic community,
5786.94 the etiquette is so different
online because I would say,
5789.273 I think in person
5790.45 people would probably
behave a bit differently.
5791.978 - They shake your hand and say, hello.
5793.12 - Yeah, they shake your
hand and say, hello.
5794.688 And there's also, look, I'll
just be very direct about this.
5799.03 There are a lot of people online for whom
5801.28 their only content is pointing
out the misunderstandings
5805.12 or alleged flaws of other people.
5807.243 It's like the bulk of their identity.
5809.59 Which to me is sort of a sad existence
5811.57 but there's always more
to gain by thinking about
5814.42 what's possible, and
what's new and what's good.
5816.4 But teach their own demise or win.
5820.39 - I mean questioning what's
out there is healthy,
5823.491 it's normal, is great, it
actually sparks conversation.
5825.89 But as you said, some people's existence
5828.07 is solely to find things to nag about
5831.82 and not actually with the goal
being to advance anything,
5834.58 but rather just to.
5836.23 - Yeah, in the world of science
5838.39 being skeptical but not
cynical is encouraged.
5842.32 But I always say that
5843.91 the longer that somebody's
in a career path
5846.22 that's certainly in science or medicine
5847.84 and they realize how hard
it is to do various studies.
5851.92 Once they publish a few studies,
5853.15 generally they sort of get
a better understanding of
5856.18 how the various things are done.
5858.04 In any case, along the lines
of pain and pain relief
5864.22 and misunderstandings about the
origins of pain in the body,
5867.143 one of the great tools that
I picked up from your content
5870.94 which is benefit I know a
huge number of people is
5874.36 I think I used to hold weights
5875.98 sometimes in the tips of my fingers
5877.9 as opposed to in the meat
or the palm of my hands.
5880.39 And I had elbow pain.
5881.74 And I always thought that,
5882.73 I felt it most on tricep
exercises and pushing exercise
5885.427 and I thought I was doing
those exercises wrong.
5887.92 Turns out toward the end of
my pull ups or my bicep work,
5891.25 I was letting the weight or the bar
5892.66 drift into my fingertips.
5894.25 And the mere shift
5896.71 to making sure that my
knuckles were well over the bar
5899.35 or that the weight was really
in the meat of my palms
5902.56 has completely ameliorated that
5904.54 for reasons that you point out
5906.19 and maybe you could just
share with us why that is
5907.93 you have this kind of
finger pull exercise.
5910.72 Usually when someone says, pull my finger,
5912.1 it's like a bad middle school
or elementary school joke...
5914.746 - Yeah, we would say push your finger.
5916.426 - [Andrew] Right, right.
5917.259 - You know this is fascinating.
5918.79 This is because it just shows again
5920.98 how intricate the body is
5922.3 and how responsive or
over responsive it can be
5924.76 to something so little.
5925.99 And what you're talking about
is that when you grip a bar
5930.37 whether it be through a curl
or whether it be through-
5932.467 And this is mostly
pulling exercises because
5935.23 the tendency for the bar is going to be to
5937.18 fall out of your hand not
like with a pushing exercise
5939.49 where it's kind of you're
pushing your hand into the bar.
5941.71 So on a bench press say.
5944.2 That bar can drift just
by gravity doing its thing
5948.85 or fatigue of the hand grip strength.
5952.14 Can start to drift further
away towards the distal digits.
5956.65 Through those last couple knuckles
5958.96 that we have on our hands.
5960.34 And though our hand can
still hold it there,
5964.094 the muscles are not equipped
to handle those types of loads.
5968.5 And that can start at a very,
I'm not going to say light,
5971.68 but like it could start
at dumbbell weight.
5975.7 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even
25 pounds or something
5978.97 depending upon their
overall strength levels.
5980.95 But then when you start to
apply it to something like
5983.59 your body weight with a chin up, right?
5986.29 'Cause that's natural for
the bar to somewhat kind of
5989.05 float down towards your fingertips.
5990.88 And it actually is a little bit easier
5993.31 to perform the exercise with
that sort of like false script
5996.79 little hook grip at the end
5998.14 because you're not going
to engage the forearms
6000.84 into the exercise, you're not
going to start pulling down.
6003.589 But at the same time while it
could help you to perform them
6007.98 better by getting the back more activated,
6010.29 if you have weakness in these muscles.
6012.18 'Cause it's not a thing
that happens to every,
6013.77 it's not one of those
upright road type things
6015.81 where I think this is
happening to everybody.
6018.21 This is happening to people
6019.17 that have these inherent
weaknesses in these muscles.
6023.58 You or haven't done enough of the gripping
6025.829 in the meat of the hand for long enough
6029.85 but it starts to put that
stress on these muscles
6033.033 that are ill-equipped to
do this and to handle this
6035.727 and it starts to it's particularly
on that fourth finger,
6038.954 which is part of the
muscle we call the FDS,
6041.79 a flexor digitorum that is
just too much for it to handle.
6045.42 And that comes all the way down
6046.83 and meets right at the media level.
6048.36 Right on that spot that you can say
6050.01 feels like someone's knifing
you right in the middle
6051.99 in that medial level.
6053.16 And medial epicondylitis or
they call it golfers elbow
6056.73 is something that a lot of
us deal with in the gym.
6059.85 It's one of the most common
inflammatory conditions
6062.43 people get from the gym
6063.54 and it all comes from this
positioning of the dumbbell
6067.44 or barbell or hand on a
pull-up bar over time.
6070.53 So the easiest thing to
do is just grip deeper
6073.62 so that what you're doing is you're using
6075.19 more leverage from the
palm to encapsulate the bar
6079.41 or the dumbbell or whatever
6080.76 and you're not putting that
pressure really distally
6083.64 right on that last digit
6085.53 because that's where that
FDS muscle is most strained.
6089.49 So you just almost eliminating
that from the equation.
6093.24 And it's one of those exercises that
6096.316 the load can exceed its
capacity pretty quickly.
6099.09 So that like, maybe it's only
capable of handling 30 pounds
6102.796 and then when you're doing a chin up
6104.43 and it goes and it drifts so far
6106.007 that it's now you say
you're a 200 pound guy
6109.296 you've got let's say 100
pounds through one arm
6111.927 and 100 pounds, this is simplified math
6114.27 that obviously is offset by other muscles,
6115.95 but 100 pounds to one arm
100 pounds to the arm,
6118.02 100 pounds off of a
muscle that can handle 30
6120.96 is not going to take many
repetitions to strain it
6123.265 and you're going to feel that maybe
6125.1 by the time that a set's over
6126.42 or certainly by the time that
workout's over or the next day
6128.61 you wake up and you've got
that notable stabbing pain.
6131.031 Whenever someone feels that
6132.833 the best thing would be to determine,
6135.18 okay, what exercises would
I do that were pulling
6138.09 and where the bar could
have drifted deeper
6139.98 or further from the meat
of my palm into my fingers
6144.36 and figure out a way to deepen that grip.
6146.4 When that happens though,
the best thing to do
6148.41 with most of these inflammatory conditions
6150.63 is not do any of that
stuff for a little while.
6153.24 Not ever, just for a little while.
6155.4 There's always things
that you can do around it.
6157.35 I'm not saying ever do I say,
like, don't go to the gym
6160.05 or don't find something you can do,
6161.88 but I'm saying that particular exercise
6164.28 that you feel the pain
on while you're doing it,
6167.28 never a smart idea to do that
exercise when it's inflamed.
6171.39 If you are doing exercise and it hurts,
6173.07 you probably shouldn't do the exercise
6174.63 because another reason
6177.055 for the variability of exercise is
6180.42 there's so many other
options that you can do
6182.73 that will train similar
muscles or even the same motion
6185.52 and not cause that stress.
6187.11 So, I mean, a cable curl would
be much easier to do that on
6191.16 than let's say a chin up
6192.66 where you don't have the
control over the weight
6194.58 like you do by moving a pin on a stack.
6196.98 So I think that is a common
thing that people find
6201.51 and the best thing to
do is just figure out
6203.52 how deep you gripping in that bar.
6205.41 You're going to find that, oh
my God, I didn't realize that
6207.21 because it was just.
6208.043 Even though you might start
a set in a good position
6210.54 and then it drifts away as you go.
6212.46 - I think that's what was happening to me
6214.5 and I'm very conscious of this now.
6215.91 Again, for me, I haven't
had this elbow pain at all.
6220.184 - [Jeff] That's great.
- Very fortunate.
6222.12 So again, a debt of
gratitude to your never-
6225.06 I thought there was some
wrong in my elbow, basically.
6227.365 And I thought maybe it was tennis elbow
6229.68 I don't even play tennis.
6230.894 There you go.
6232.633 Other aspects of recovery
and variables for recovery.
6237.359 I think you and I both
put out content about
6239.73 the use of cold and I think
we can summarize it by saying,
6242.19 yeah, it does seem like
cold water immersion
6244.5 immediately after hypertrophy
restrains workouts
6247.41 might be a problem,
6248.243 but a cold shower is
probably not a problem.
6249.66 What about heat?
6250.745 Do you personally use
heat and cold saunas,
6255.9 hot baths, hot compresses.
6257.974 And by you, I mean you
personally and athletes
6262.244 that you coach or people that you coach,
6265.44 what are your thoughts on
the use of heat and or cold?
6268.29 - Well, I think it might
just be an inherited practice
6272.55 from the days of trainers
of since babe Ruth.
6276.99 But we in baseball
6278.04 we used a lot of cold
following performance.
6280.89 Just because the idea would be
6283.47 there is some especially pitchers,
6285.48 there is some inflammation
that is abnormal.
6288.36 The arm is not really
designed to do what they do
6290.64 especially at the speed that they move it
6293.01 and everything else.
6293.88 So we would use ice as a
pretty standard practice
6296.97 after that.
6298.079 But not a lot of heat
and use a lot of heat
6301.65 and of course from the
recovery or the healing aspect
6304.612 that actually becomes
rather personal preference
6308.97 they've found now after let's
say the first 12 to 24 hours
6313.83 where you're really trying
to control inflammation
6315.6 of what might be an injury.
6317.37 But then it can kind of
shift the personal preference
6319.53 because the heat can bring
blood to the area also
6322.8 and then the cold has its sort
of antiinflammatory effects.
6327.27 So like there's a balance between
6329.34 which one's working better for you.
6330.99 So there's really no standard anymore
6332.58 for heat or cold in that way.
6334.32 But from a standpoint of like
post-workout healthy status,
6339.48 I haven't used much heat or
cold in terms of what we do.
6342.75 We cover the topic of the cold showers
6344.52 and to try to dispel the myth of the,
6347.416 even people saying that there's
giant testosterone releases
6350.94 and you know all kinds of stuff that.
6352.536 Listen, we hear all kinds of things
6353.927 'cause people want-
6355.38 I think the idea of just
turning the water cold
6358.11 and being in it for 30 seconds
6359.64 and then all of a sudden
6360.473 magically growing three times your size
6362.43 is intriguing for a lot of people
6364.5 and that's why they ask these
questions 'cause they're like,
6365.86 well, that would be a hell of a lot easier
6367.47 than going to the gym and training hard.
6369.87 But like, I'm always
fascinated by some of the stuff
6372.21 that you talked about.
6373.32 In fact, we started to talk
about some of the stuff
6375.3 in terms of cooling and what
it can do on performance
6378.15 and that was like there's
some untapped territory there
6382.32 that I think you're finding out about.
6384.78 - Yeah, what would be fun
would be to bring the CoolMitt
6387.12 technology from Stanford.
6388.32 This is Craig Heller, my
colleague Craig Heller's lab
6390.87 at Stanford's done really
important and amazing work
6394.65 in this area but then it
moved on to some other things.
6396.72 He's also working on down syndrome
6398.19 and he works on a number of
other really important topics
6400.47 that scientists often do.
6402.06 But I have access to
this CoolMitt technology,
6404.64 no relationship to the
company, by the way,
6406.32 would love to come out to your facility
6407.82 and we can do the blind type studies.
6412.11 - Like the blue blocker test.
6413.04 - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
6414.651 And see how that goes in with somebody
6419.028 as advanced trained as you
6420.948 that's probably the best thing to do.
6422.52 So content for the future.
6424.953 Yeah, I think heat and cold
6426.78 are kind of staples in the PT world
6428.64 and it does seem like people
use them slightly differently
6431.52 but they are kind of the macro
nutrients of recovery there
6435.15 along with sleep.
6437.062 I do have a question about
precision of record keeping.
6443.04 Do you keep a training journal?
6445.41 Do you recommend people
keep training journals?
6447.72 Are you neurotically fixed
to cadence of movement
6451.41 and are you looking at the,
6452.82 do you have a buzzer going off
6454.41 when it's 90 seconds rest.
6455.7 Is it 90 seconds rest?
6456.99 I confess I have my slow
workouts and my faster workouts.
6460.051 And they scale with whether
or not I'm training heavier
6462.63 with longer rest.
6463.71 Or whether or not maybe
midway through a workout,
6466.11 I'll shift over to doing
higher repetition, lower rest.
6468.36 This is kind of my crude
way of keeping time.
6473.43 But I'm not-
6474.63 Will be just to kind of watch the clock.
6476.55 But I'm not neurotically
fixed to the buzzer
6479.85 nor am I on social media
during my workouts.
6482.43 Which is actually a way
to really improve workouts
6485.04 is to just not be on social media.
6488.25 - I can't claim that
I'm not guilty of that.
6490.53 Sometimes I am on social media
6492.09 but sometimes I'm trying
to post something.
6493.59 - Well, that's different,
it's your profession.
6495.57 It's your profession.
6496.644 - But I mean, I'm not necessarily chained
6504.42 to some sort of protocol
in terms of how I do.
6507.27 I think by this point I've
been doing this a long time
6509.79 and not only is it something
that I've done for a long time,
6511.62 but it's a passion of mine,
it's something I really enjoy.
6513.75 So I probably inherently have
6516.24 the ability to stick to these guidelines
6519.57 in terms of rest time
to know what I lifted.
6524.148 Even six months ago on
a lift and how it felt
6528.24 without journaling it.
6529.71 But I recognize the value
it has to a lot of people,
6532.89 it goes back to that whole
my muscle connection idea
6535.92 that we talked about in the beginning.
6537.06 Like there's a lack of awareness
6538.89 for all aspects of training.
6540.6 And especially maybe it isn't
like your interest level.
6543.0 We're talking you and I
from a position of interest.
6547.2 Like this is what we do.
6548.04 We enjoy just how our bodies work
6550.95 and understanding how they work.
6552.12 Some people don't care, they
just want the end result.
6554.49 But journaling and keeping track of that
6557.52 raises awareness to where like,
6558.78 oh my God, I have been on Instagram
6561.66 for the last seven minutes
6562.98 and I was supposed to be back
at my next set in 90 seconds.
6566.1 Like there is a training effect of that.
6568.32 Like if you're training
for a metabolic overload,
6572.13 you've blown that opportunity
because you haven't,
6574.53 your rest time very
important to that protocol,
6578.94 working as it should.
6580.388 If you were training for strength,
6582.09 maybe the extra few minutes
doesn't matter so much
6584.19 when you get back under
the bar you might find,
6586.83 you might find that it's a
better response for your body
6589.26 to rest even longer than you've been told
6591.33 three, four minutes, five minutes.
6592.953 And so that way maybe it helps,
6594.96 but I think that anything you can do
6597.99 to increase your awareness
of your performance
6600.36 and also give yourself
some objective goal.
6604.38 Whenever we have an objective goal,
6605.583 it's a lot easier to actually obtain it.
6607.47 When you're just there to get a pump
6609.57 and you're just there to
lift how you feel that day,
6613.71 you have to be incredibly disciplined
6615.42 in all other aspects of your workout
6617.16 in order to make that effective.
6618.96 And I've done that too.
6620.04 I've actually been able
to do that too, but again,
6622.56 the level of repetitions I've accumulated
6625.32 over the course of my
life in the amount that I
6627.956 read about this stuff.
6630.086 I think I'm able to get away with that,
6631.977 but I think more often
than not what I'm doing is
6635.82 not journaling but journaling in my head
6638.85 exactly what I think
people should be doing
6640.95 and that is getting a specific effect
6642.687 from what you're trying to do.
6644.31 It's not so haphazard.
6645.75 You want to get a specific effect
6647.4 just like any other
experiment that you're doing.
6649.23 If you're doing an
experiment on your own body
6651.0 with your own weight,
6651.9 which to me is one of the
most empowering things
6654.78 someone can ever do.
6655.613 When they get bitten by the bug
6657.11 for exercising and in training
6660.45 and I like to use the word
training rather than exercise
6662.751 'cause there's a purpose behind it.
6663.99 But when they get bitten
by that training bug
6666.15 and they start to see
actual changes and results,
6668.76 you know how empowering that
is 'cause we can't change,
6670.71 we can't really control that
many things in our life,
6672.93 unfortunately.
6673.77 And if there's some
things that happen to us
6675.18 that we really wish never happened.
6676.833 And those are not something
that we can do anything about,
6679.98 but this is one thing that
we can do our best to.
6682.47 We can't avoid disease entirely,
6684.27 we can't predict when we're going to die,
6685.86 we can't do those things,
6687.96 but we can certainly decide to
show up into the gym that day
6691.02 and get a workout in or go
for a run or do something
6693.75 and in by doing that, you're
giving yourself I think,
6696.15 a better chance at a
higher quality of life.
6698.04 So anything you could do to
increase your awareness of it
6701.07 and keep you on track with that
is like I'm endorsing fully.
6704.88 - Couldn't agree more,
I could not agree more.
6708.003 There is a topic it's
sort of a dreaded topic,
6710.82 but I think it's an important one
6711.9 and that's the topic of nutrition.
6713.49 And rather they get into
specific meal programs,
6716.7 which would take take
hours and probably wouldn't
6720.3 even manage to scratch the
surface even with hours.
6722.853 We could talk about
principles around nutrition.
6726.933 What are sort of the themes that
6729.0 you think people should keep in mind
6730.803 when thinking about how to
eat generally and pre-training
6737.7 and post-training are two
particularly sensitive times
6741.54 for most, or at times that
people want to know a lot about.
6744.9 What should they eat before training
6746.49 or can they train fasted?
6747.84 What should they eat afterwards?
6749.07 But just in general, what
do you think are some axioms
6752.228 of nutrition that really hold.
6755.01 And I ask this 'cause,
6757.74 not because there's a
lot of debate about this,
6760.47 but because you've been
around this space a long time
6763.076 and you've seen what
works for you obviously
6766.5 but for other people too.
6768.93 What tends to work?
6770.07 What tends not to work?
6771.9 And how should we think about nutrition?
6774.42 - I mean, look, you've
touched on it a bit but like,
6778.26 nutrition can be a touchy
subject for people.
6780.57 And I understand where that comes from.
6782.79 I've talked about before that
there's a dogmatic tendency
6787.02 to nutrition, and there's a reason for it
6788.91 because it's an area
that people struggle with
6792.39 more than anything else.
6793.47 And the reason why people
struggle with nutrition
6795.57 is because the commitment
is extremely high.
6799.17 You could start a workout program
6801.9 and actually get to the gym
three to five times a week.
6804.72 That's five hours
6806.19 based on how you and I
were discussing it before.
6808.53 Well, what about the other 23
hours of each of those days.
6811.89 There's opportunity to eat
incorrectly or unhealthily
6816.0 every one of those hours.
6817.29 People wake up in the middle
of the night to go eat.
6819.24 Like there are things that you can do
6822.3 that can cause amazing amounts of damage
6825.049 to your longevity in the 23 hours
6828.66 not the 1 hour, the 23 hours.
6830.43 So when people finally figure out a way
6834.03 to make that work for them,
6836.49 it's very passionate and I
understand their passion.
6839.85 I do like I've put out, so my
approach, my approach is like,
6842.76 I've always been sort of a
low sugar, lower fat guy.
6846.69 I've made the mistake of
going no fat years ago
6849.33 and I paid for it.
6850.163 I was like in college and back in the day
6852.48 we were the same age.
6853.56 We read all the magazines
and that was what we had.
6856.08 We didn't have an internet then.
6856.98 So we were reading magazines
6858.51 and the recommended
path was to go low fat.
6862.2 It helps you to become
hypo caloric very easily
6865.62 because the density of the
calories in a gram of fat
6869.28 versus a gram of carbohydrates or protein
6871.14 is nine versus four for
the carbs and protein.
6874.44 So if you're cutting out
grams of fat on a daily basis,
6877.11 you're quickly cutting out calories
6879.03 that allows you to get leaner.
6880.77 Well, of course as everything,
I mean, if little is good,
6884.1 then a lot is better.
6885.09 So I would cut all of them
out or almost all of them
6888.42 and at the age of 22, 21,
I'm like standing at a stop
6894.2 up at University of Connecticut
6895.74 waiting for the tram to
come and bring me to campus.
6898.65 And I couldn't even open my eyes
6900.69 because the light was blinding to me.
6902.91 It was normal sunlight.
6904.29 It was blinding to me,
the photosensitivity I had
6907.35 learning later on after a few more courses
6909.48 that I took there in biology
6911.061 how necessary fat was for the
development of healthy cells.
6918.9 I realized what was going on
6921.141 and not to mention other
stuff skin was bad,
6923.64 hair was falling out, all kinds of stuff.
6925.23 So I think that the
approach to decreasing fat
6931.95 so it's not excessive,
6933.24 because again how
calorically dense it could be
6934.89 in having lower sugar.
6936.36 I'm a firm believer in
sugar is really pretty toxic
6939.36 and something that we would
all do better getting rid of
6943.02 a lot of it.
6944.244 That is the best approach
for, I believe, again,
6948.45 in my opinion, personally,
for the overall big picture.
6952.29 Because though the people can
take exclusionary approaches
6955.86 to nutrition and taking carbs out or
6958.36 eating only fats and proteins, or again,
6962.37 I'm not saying it doesn't work for you.
6963.78 And if it's the first thing
that actually allowed you
6965.76 to gain control of your nutrition
6966.99 to the point where you
actually saw results
6968.28 and got to a healthier
weight, then I always say,
6970.62 then do it, then do it.
6971.82 But just make sure it's
something you can do forever
6974.07 and doesn't bring upon
other repercussions.
6977.04 But I think that non
exclusionary approaches to diets
6981.603 are the most sustainable
for the rest of your life.
6985.8 And all I'm interested in
from a nutrition standpoint
6988.19 is something that's sustainable.
6989.58 So when I preach what I preach,
6990.81 I've been doing this since I was 15, 14.
6995.7 People say like, how's he
get so ripped? How's he get?
6998.46 I have been doing this for four-
7000.77 For how many years? 30 years.
- Eating clean low sugar.
7004.13 - Yeah, 30 years.
7005.36 And the beginning it was
a slow shift I had to make
7009.62 where I was like,
7010.46 I went from the worst
diet in the whole world.
7013.365 Even when I was 14 years
old, my breakfast was,
7017.475 I talked about this so
many times, but Entenmann's
7019.58 I would eat Entenmann's donuts and...
7021.95 - Those long rod-
- Yeah, the long [indistinct]
7024.458 - They even took the
hole out of the donut.
7027.127 - [Jeff] Exactly.
7028.741 Why would you delete
the middle of the donut?
7031.89 - The crumb donut there.
7034.375 I would eat donuts...
- I can taste it in my-
7036.32 I don't like sugar very much
7037.49 but over the years I've
lost my appetite for sugar.
7040.13 But as you talk about the entiments
7041.51 I can literally smell
and taste the frosting.
7044.57 And to me now it's disgusting
7045.86 but back then it might
have been appetizing.
7047.75 - You would probably have
like really good information
7049.58 on this, but like my ability
to actually remember,
7053.747 they've said smell is very
evoking of memories, right?
7057.74 - So smell is unlike the other senses
7059.93 because there's a direct line literally
7062.51 from our sense of smell to the
memory centers of the brain.
7064.97 It doesn't have to go through
any intermediate stations.
7066.89 - Okay, so my ability to actually recall
7070.255 exact taste of all the
stuff that I used to love
7073.955 is enough to satisfy me to not
engage in those things now.
7079.21 As crazy as that is.
7080.043 Like I almost get my
feel through remembering
7083.03 'cause of these strong senses of memory
7085.37 of what it was like,
7086.42 'cause oh, that used to taste so good.
7087.5 Okay, that's good, I had it so...
7088.73 - Fantastic.
7089.854 We know the neuromodulator
there, that's dopamine.
7093.59 Your ability to get the dopamine release
7095.75 from the thought of some things.
7097.43 Most people when they get
that dopamine release,
7100.28 it causes a triggering
of the desire for more.
7103.067 - [Jeff] for more.
7103.9 - Right, people think
of dopamine as pleasure.
7105.62 Dopamine, there's a
book, great book called,
7107.727 "The Molecule of More."
7108.74 I didn't write the book
unfortunately, but someone else did
7111.26 and it's a great book
and it's really about
7113.06 how dopamine we think it's about pleasure,
7115.34 but it establishes craving.
7116.96 So you're able to satisfy that
7118.52 and it is a very adaptive
thing for you because
7120.8 you are indeed very lean
7122.522 and that's one of your
kind of hallmark things
7125.343 as a professional who does
this in the public space
7128.18 that's important when people
are out there talking about
7130.37 getting lean and you look
at them and you're like,
7132.407 maybe you need to do the protocols.
7135.74 It's a huge advantage
but yeah, I think that,
7138.62 it sounds like you've cultivated practices
7141.5 around avoiding certain things.
7143.27 - Yes.
7144.47 But not avoiding certain
things that I think
7147.77 are easily avoided if
you realize that there,
7152.03 I think that we have enough
science and literature out there
7154.25 to prove that the altered
path is a better path.
7157.816 You know what I mean?
7158.78 Like I feel like if I was just doing it
7161.0 because I wanted to be lean,
7162.32 I'm not quite sure it
would've held for so long.
7165.413 - Well and we have a
guest that whose episode
7168.92 has been recorded for this podcast
7170.18 who runs an eating disorder clinic
7172.34 at the University of Pennsylvania.
7173.93 Medical school, studies binge
eating disorders, anorexia,
7176.9 OCD and he will go on record in obesity,
7179.93 and he will go on record saying that
7181.43 these very highly palatable
processed high sugar foods
7185.09 of the sort that we're talking
about, donuts and so forth,
7188.9 that they are actually dangerous, right?
7192.17 That there are elements
7193.58 of the way that they
engage neural circuitry.
7195.86 He's a neurosurgeon that reshape the brain
7198.86 in dangerous ways.
7200.18 And those are his words and...
7201.838 - Yeah and it's not just entiments.
7203.013 I mean, I think not just entiments right?
7205.177 Yeah, they're coming after
us, with what, with donuts.
7209.96 - [Jeff] Exactly.
7211.13 - Yeah, they can't catch us.
7212.87 - [Jeff] True, true.
7214.79 - In any case.
7216.02 So in terms of what you do eat,
7218.84 how do you structure that in terms of,
7221.54 when you look down at a
plate you've done this,
7223.88 described this before,
7224.72 but I think it's just a
beautifully simple description
7226.94 'cause I think a lot of
people don't want to do
7228.32 calorie counting and all this and
7230.253 how should people think about what to eat?
7234.83 - So yeah, I have like
what I call a plate method
7237.83 and it's just simple
'cause it works for me.
7240.018 And again, if you're struggling
with real eating issues,
7245.24 these mechanisms become
admittedly less effective
7249.35 because you're having
7250.67 maybe you have emotionally
triggered eating
7252.05 and you can't stop at one plate.
7253.79 I mean that you could get the plate right
7255.77 but if the portions are out of control.
7257.51 - Plate has a dimensionality of height?
7260.93 - Or multiple plates like
second and third plate.
7263.14 - Or fourth.
7264.079 - Like then all these
things can be challenged
7267.14 but what I say is when you have your plate
7270.92 then you just simply look
at it as like a clock.
7275.72 And if you just make a 9:20 on the clock,
7279.77 so one arm goes over to the 9
7282.11 and one of the arms goes over to 20.
7284.24 Well, then you're basically...
7285.8 You're going to take the
second largest portion of that
7288.877 'cause you're going to make a
line towards 12 o'clock too.
7291.8 And the largest portion is going to be
7293.646 your fibers carbohydrate.
7295.13 So that's the green vegetables, right?
7298.64 So whether it be broccoli or
Brussels sprouts, or asparagus,
7301.64 or pick your favorites.
7305.33 Like those are the ones
7306.74 that give us a lot of the
micronutrients we need,
7308.96 they're the ones that are generally
7310.203 accepted as more healthy
7312.273 and they're also going
to provide the fiber
7314.84 that's going to be both beneficial
7316.4 in terms of its impact on insulin
7318.53 and also just through
filling you up, right?
7321.26 And then I take the next
largest portion of that
7324.62 and I devote that towards protein.
7326.537 And I think it's really important
7327.86 especially for anybody active,
7329.503 the more active you are
7331.19 the more you embark on
trying to build muscle
7333.23 you're going to need to
have protein in every meal.
7335.06 So I have that.
7335.96 And again, you know, here we're talking
7337.88 cleaner sources of protein.
7339.2 But like, you'll never find
like boiled chicken on my plate.
7342.71 Like I ditched those days
when I was 16 or 15 or 16,
7345.8 like I realized after reading
those body building magazines
7348.53 that maybe the low fat
thing stuck for too long,
7351.29 but the no fat thing stuck for too long,
7353.78 but the boiled chicken
and a steam broccoli thing
7358.46 that ended quickly for me
7359.293 'cause I really I'm not
going to eat this forever.
7361.46 So I'll have some sort of fish or chicken
7364.37 but it'll be cooked in a way that's like
7368.15 it's got maybe some sauce on it
7369.94 or it's got some maybe it's tomato sauce.
7372.26 Anything to just make it a
little bit more palatable
7374.27 and interesting without
blowing the value of the meal.
7376.58 And then that last portion
7377.78 is where I put my starchy carbohydrates.
7380.06 And again, that's the part
that some people will say
7381.71 exclude them entirely
'cause they're not healthy
7383.42 or they don't work for you
7384.44 or they're not beneficial long term.
7386.93 For me it's been a God sent.
7388.97 And I do think I'm like most people
7391.58 my body craves those carbohydrates.
7393.83 I choose things like sweet
potatoes which is my favorite
7397.4 or I'll have rice or I'll have pasta.
7401.15 I'm Italian so I like pasta.
7402.86 And like I will have those
things, I'm not excluding them,
7405.56 but I don't put them in the portions
7406.91 that you would generally find.
7408.22 My wife and I will go out
7410.54 and we'll go to the restaurant sometimes
7412.37 because we travel quite a bit
7414.32 or used to at least with baseball too.
7416.33 There's a cheesecake
factory everywhere you went
7418.13 and I love cheesecake factory,
7419.87 but like the way they structure meals is
7422.81 it's all rice at the bottom,
7425.03 and a little bit of chicken on top.
7426.26 And I mean, it's a plateful of rice
7428.57 that you wouldn't find
me make a plate that way.
7430.82 I'm going to just devote
that portion of the plate
7433.22 to the starchy carbohydrate.
7434.815 And so it gives me a little
bit more responsibility
7437.42 in terms of portion control
'cause those are the foods,
7439.885 again, probably dopamine driven that are
7443.63 most easily over eaten.
7445.31 I always ask the question,
7446.51 what's the last time you ate
10 chicken breasts at a meal?
7449.57 Like you're getting sick of
it after maybe two or three,
7452.0 but you could eat a whole hell
of a lot of carbohydrates,
7454.64 starchy carbohydrates
7455.57 because the they're just so satisfying
7458.12 and I think those triggers,
as you said, to want more,
7460.64 like that's what happens, right?
7461.9 You just keep eating, even
when you're feeling full,
7463.61 you want more.
7465.018 And that's the biggest
danger to carbohydrate.
7467.45 So if you can develop some
sort of discipline around them,
7472.04 then you can still enjoy them.
7473.21 If you can't develop that
discipline for whatever reason,
7477.08 then maybe they do become something
7478.52 that you have to work yourself around
7479.93 or adopt a different eating style.
7481.25 And as I said, I'm
never to the point where
7483.53 I'm not trying to be
dogmatic in my approach.
7485.9 I'm always trying to
say, this is how I do it
7488.27 and I'm a believer in it
7489.53 just like everyone else's
believer in their method,
7491.81 but I'm open to the idea that
something that works for you
7495.05 and gets you to a healthier
weight and a sustainability,
7498.752 like that is good, that's good for me.
7501.71 Provided doesn't introduce other issues.
7505.01 - Something one can do consistently,
7506.69 that's something I picked
up from you over the years.
7510.2 What can you do consistently?
7511.28 And for me, that also meant,
when, and how can I eat?
7514.91 What can I eat consistently
7516.32 that will also allow me
to be alert after lunch
7518.42 so I can actually get some work done.
7519.952 Or eat, I like to train
fasted in the morning
7523.25 but I don't do any long term fasting.
7524.66 It just so happens that I'm
fine doing water and caffeine
7528.23 in the morning and training in the morning
7530.21 and then I eat my first meal afterwards.
7532.28 But I get carbohydrates at night
7534.02 so my glycogen is restored.
7535.79 I think carbohydrates are wonderful.
7537.74 I just don't eat them in excess.
7539.33 So to me, I feel like when
7541.729 what you describe as a very rational
7543.62 literally balanced approach.
7545.45 And obviously there will be variations
7546.952 for people who are dealing
with obesity or diabetes.
7551.0 I've got friends that are
on the pure carnivore thing,
7553.61 I have friends that are vegan
7554.69 and it's always impressive to me
7557.27 when somebody can stick
to anything consistently
7561.256 except when they're sticking
to just poor behavior.
7564.5 'Cause there's nothing
impressive about that.
7566.72 Well, I think that's very helpful
7569.45 because I think there's,-
7570.53 For the typical listener of this podcast,
7573.369 the online content that people see,
7576.44 the battles are very confusing.
7578.23 They're distracting.
7580.01 Because people really think,
7580.843 oh, that there's a right
way and a wrong way
7582.737 and it sounds like the way that one can
7584.785 eat consistently over time that's healthy.
7588.71 Certainly fewer processed
and sugary foods,
7590.96 I think almost everybody agrees there.
7592.173 - Yeah, almost everyone
agrees on that, right?
7594.41 So I think it's calorie manipulation
7597.83 through some other method.
7599.15 So even intermittent
fasting, like you said,
7602.84 like that could be, it's
for people that are grazers.
7606.83 Like if you are a grazer
7608.21 and your real problem is portion control
7609.98 over the course of the day,
7611.72 but you can respond to a rule that says,
7613.7 no, you're eating between here and here,
7616.043 that you can obey that rule.
7618.08 Well, you're not going to be able to graze
7620.18 during the times that you might
be doing additional damage.
7622.43 So sure there's other hormonal benefits
7626.6 that people will talk
about from that approach.
7628.49 But from a longevity standpoint
7630.83 and habit forming standpoint,
7632.45 if it's fixing the habit that
you're breaking too often
7636.23 by eating throughout
7637.07 whenever you feel like you
walk by food, it's good
7641.24 and it works.
7642.073 And again, if people can, will tell you
7645.53 you can probably eat
whatever you want to eat
7647.21 as long as you're eating
within that window.
7649.52 But I think the more responsible people
7651.56 who are practitioners of that will say,
7653.51 no, you still want to
avoid processed sugar
7655.73 and things like that.
7657.02 And that's just a mechanism
of eating not really a diet.
7660.32 But like it's I think that people-
7663.275 I hate to be as like as
basic as it sounds with that
7667.43 but it's for the exact reason that
7669.32 if it it's that 23 hour day
phenomenon that it's like,
7673.015 you said you're impressed,
it is impressive.
7675.35 It's so hard to control
all of our behaviors
7678.11 and food being one of the hardest thing.
7679.537 One of the biggest temptations for people.
7682.01 You got to learn how to
control that for so long
7684.23 and then do it day after day after day,
7686.541 whatever that mechanism is that
works for you is impressive
7691.821 and I'm a believer in it.
7695.18 I think that's how I feel.
7697.94 I just feel like the
people need to be able
7699.38 to be given some reigns
7700.67 to be able to find what works for them.
7703.46 - Well, I love to eat
7704.45 and one of the beauties of weight training
7706.07 is I feel like I can eat plenty for my age
7709.19 and I'm not as lean as you are,
7710.87 but I'm happy with where I'm at.
7713.343 I could always do better.
7714.69 With each year actually I'm getting better
7717.68 probably because I'm eating cleaner.
7719.12 Probably 'cause I also have
someone to cook for me now.
7721.542 And we like...
I have that too.
7724.04 - We like healthy food
and so I'm very fortunate.
7726.62 I don't think we have any
packaged food in our home.
7729.86 We even started making sauerkraut
at home, I don't make it.
7732.037 I mean she makes it.
7733.94 - My wife actually she turned me on
7736.85 to a tip that I actually
shared with the whole channel
7739.25 which was like, you can go to,
7743.24 we have a Stew Leonard's around
our big grocery store chain
7746.63 around us and they have
a catering department.
7748.73 And they're often used
for catering big parties
7751.31 and big tubs of grilled chicken,
7753.74 but like really good grilled chicken.
7755.93 Again, not the boiled chicken
7757.277 and big tubs of sweet potatoes.
7759.02 And we'll get a bunch of those
7762.17 and she'll go over and she'll get them
7763.003 and then she'll sort of
arrange them on plates
7766.001 and put the plates in and like,
7768.02 I'm okay with repetitive eating.
7769.67 I think more people are probably
okay with repetitive eating
7772.22 than they think.
7773.053 I think that when you actually break down
7775.721 how many different breakfast
variations, do you have?
7778.97 Three, two.
7780.26 - Two or three maximum.
7781.4 - So like, I think when the
people do there's more variety
7783.5 for dinner probably but like
7785.21 even there you probably eat
five different types of dinners
7788.12 over the course of a week or a month.
7790.445 Well, if you have that ability to identify
7794.36 the things that you like, and
again, no plan is going to work
7796.97 if you're eating stuff you don't like.
7798.11 It's not going to work
forever, nothing will,
7800.27 you have to really enjoy
what you're eating.
7801.92 As long as these variations of this meal
7805.94 are something that you really enjoy
7807.411 and there are limited versions of them,
7810.38 the reproducibility of that is simple.
7813.365 It will take some time but
if you're fortunate enough
7816.02 in our case to have somebody
who can prepare it for you,
7818.42 now that's even part out of the equation.
7820.64 And it just makes it very simple.
7823.55 But I do think when you tally up
7826.01 all the costs of medical care
7828.095 that are spiked by having poor nutrition
7831.726 and you then offset that
by what it might cost you
7836.06 to invest in a faster strategy
like this catering trick
7839.54 or whatever it might be,
7840.83 you'd be best off figuring out a way
7842.87 to maybe reallocate some of your money
7844.67 to preparing this because
how important it is
7847.22 to your long term health and longevity.
7849.29 If you can figure out
your nutrition issues,
7852.38 if everyone listening to this podcast
7853.85 can figure out their nutrition issues,
7855.605 this whole world will be different.
7857.51 That is like one of the
largest sources of disease,
7860.419 and pain and discomfort
7862.19 because people really
struggle with nutrition.
7864.2 - Yeah, and it's a huge problem.
7865.503 I mean the obesity, it is
an epidemic in this country.
7869.63 It's a very, very serious.
7871.19 Also a lot of highly processed
foods are more expensive
7874.37 than healthier foods when
you really break it down.
7877.306 Even the better sourced high quality foods
7881.15 are right there on par less
than the processed foods
7884.849 for sure.
7887.231 But couple other questions
as it relates to training.
7891.56 Because I think that one
thing that a lot of people
7895.508 wonder about and maybe we could do this
7897.65 in kind of a true false method
7900.173 just to get through some of these...
7903.008 - 50/50 I'll get it right at least.
7904.55 - Exactly.
7906.17 Men and women should train differently.
7908.3 - The science of it will say false.
7913.01 And again, not to generalize,
7914.72 but kind of the point you
touched on earlier today.
7917.48 I do find that casually
interested women in training
7922.7 will migrate more towards
certain types of fitness,
7926.0 like kickboxing, like dancing, like,
7929.33 - Low rest circuit type.
7930.74 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7931.573 And I think, again,
7932.69 whatever is that you are
going to engage in regularly
7935.712 is what you should do.
7937.37 Physiologically, no.
7938.51 And I think if we can get more women
7940.97 to feel more comfortable in the gym
7943.182 performing the same
exercises and the same,
7946.79 in receiving the same
strength training benefits
7949.07 and working on progressive
overload and like,
7950.9 we've hit the holy grail.
7952.34 But I think that it's a big bridge
7955.88 that has to be gapped still
7957.35 because there's just some reality to-
7961.04 Listen, there are very, my wife
is a perfect example of this
7966.02 living a very complicated busy life.
7968.708 We have two young boys they're twins
7971.317 and her attention and focus is there.
7975.44 And it's like, she doesn't do
this for a living like I do.
7978.71 And if she can get a decent
workout and she's happy,
7982.07 but she's not necessarily
working on her deadlift PR.
7985.177 And so I think that that
would help her and serve her
7989.12 in the long term to work
on increasing her PRs,
7993.047 and different lifts and building
her strength progressively.
7995.51 But in her life right now is
not necessarily in the cards
7999.71 to have the time to focus on that.
8001.51 So would you then discourage
8003.314 this other thing that she
might find interesting,
8005.95 like some boxing.
8007.961 There was a little, I
don't remember the brand,
8011.23 but like one of those
punchable boxing standup things
8014.23 and she enjoys it.
8015.542 Like anything to get you
moving is going be preferable
8020.98 but I don't think that
necessarily physiologically
8023.045 there's a difference.
8024.73 - You started weight
training pretty young.
8026.32 - Yeah.
8027.49 I messed around with my brother
8030.1 'cause he was older, he
was four years older.
8031.57 So I was kind of messing
around with weights probably
8033.49 12 or 13 with a 5 pound dumbbell.
8035.415 - Yeah, you hear that young
kids shouldn't work out
8038.2 with the weights.
8039.033 I don't know what the going standard is.
8040.48 Now they say, shuts down long
bone growth or growth plates
8043.907 this sort of thing.
8045.91 You've got two young boys
adorable kids by the way.
8048.07 - [Jeff] Thanks.
8049.12 - One of the things that is
very heartwarming is to see
8052.085 you're in great shape, you're
clearly extremely bright,
8054.7 you know your craft, you loved your craft.
8056.466 You work with Jesse, who
we'll talk about as well.
8060.16 - [Jeff] That's great.
- Which is great.
8062.17 There's a camaraderie there,
8063.91 having great teammates
as part of a business
8065.92 or to work out with is
just makes life better.
8068.44 Let's just be honest.
8069.58 I'm grateful to have great
teammates for the podcast
8071.65 and my lab, of course, as well.
8074.41 But to see your boys and your
dogs and the whole picture,
8080.814 I'm sure it has a lot of
contours and complexity
8082.66 that we don't know about
and shouldn't know about,
8084.46 but it's a beautiful picture.
8086.659 And will they weight train?
8088.87 I've seen the videos
of one or both of them
8091.18 hanging from the bar.
8092.013 - These kids are naturals,
I'm telling you that.
8094.3 - I wonder where they get it from.
8095.896 - I don't even encourage it.
8098.5 I'm not going to be the dad
who's sitting there saying,
8100.24 let's go somewhere.
8101.375 We got our two days.
8102.97 I'm not going to do that but
they have a natural interest
8107.32 in the gym.
8108.153 They just sometimes like
to be out with daddy.
8109.78 So they'll come out there.
8110.983 I of the two of us, my wife
and I will be the one who
8115.66 has a little bit more of a longer leash
8117.7 to let them explore things
8119.11 'cause I was a dummy at times too
8120.97 and figured out best
through the mistakes I made.
8123.255 - Through injury, right.
8124.48 In neuroscience we call
that one trial learning.
8126.55 - There you go.
8127.45 These guys are going to be
masters in one trial learning
8129.19 because you know, they'll
go grab the bars of my,
8133.03 the handles of my jamer that's there
8134.8 'cause it's at a lower level to them
8136.24 and they're swinging around
8137.32 they're doing pull-ups
on it naturally uncoached
8139.36 nothing from me.
8140.95 One will walk up to a deadlift
bar stand over it naturally
8143.71 never saw me do it,
8144.91 stands over there and just
goes, he tries to pull it.
8147.82 So there's a definitely an
inclination to liking the gym
8151.18 and I will fully support that.
8152.95 But of course body weight will
be good for quite a while.
8155.69 - Yeah, so what age do
you think is reasonable
8157.93 for kids to start exploring
a non body weight training?
8161.74 - I think around 13.
8163.15 I think around 13.
8163.983 Once puberty, I think
it's okay to start to.
8168.125 'Cause there's so much,
8170.2 I even say for people
that are like later in age
8172.81 who are just starting out,
8173.68 learn with your own body weight first,
8174.88 there's plenty of resistance to be had
8176.59 by learning how to command
your body in space.
8178.69 So if you have never trained before,
8181.63 you're going to get very stimulated
8183.49 by doing lunging and reverse lunging,
8185.44 even learning some of the
appropriate reception around
8187.24 movement through space.
8188.5 Pull-ups, chin ups.
8189.4 Pull-ups and chin ups are challenging
8190.48 for even people that have had
20, 30 years of experience
8193.03 in the gym.
8193.863 So there's a lot of stimulus
to be had by body weight
8197.23 and jumping straight to
dumbbells or barbells
8200.77 is actually doing yourself a disservice.
8202.21 You can learn better command
of your body in space
8204.97 so that when you go back
to the bigger lifts,
8207.33 you're going to have an easier time
8209.65 sort of progressively loading them
8211.18 and building up that
foundation of strength.
8212.95 I'm not saying that you have to become
8214.33 a master calisthenics athlete
8216.04 before you can touch a
barbell, that's not even true.
8218.17 I'm just saying there's so much capacity.
8220.24 Kids are going to be doing this anyway.
8221.53 And really just, if you
look at general play,
8223.72 they are jumping, they are
lunging, they are climbing,
8226.36 they are pulling like,
that's what they do.
8229.614 I don't know where the avoidance
of like structured training
8234.19 is for younger kids.
8235.63 Again, provided they're using body weight
8237.22 and maybe less ballistic
movements or something like that.
8241.54 Things that are, or certainly
overloaded movements.
8244.602 I think we should
encourage kids to do more.
8246.88 There's a lot of obesity
in kids on the rise also
8251.17 and that is incredibly
disconcerting to me.
8254.2 So I think and I hope it doesn't come from
8256.81 the advice of some that say,
8258.13 well, wait until you're older
to start doing something like.
8260.77 That's a way worse trade off
8262.63 than engaging in something smart now.
8265.36 - We used to get kicked out of
the house when we were kids.
8267.25 - [Jeff] Totally.
- My mom would kick us out.
8268.75 I had a huge pack of boys
that lived on my street
8272.29 but we'd get kicked outside.
8273.745 Like literal, you're not
allowed in, no television.
8277.63 But there were video games, of course
8279.19 but we were kicked out the house.
8280.57 We had to go play.
8281.5 For us it was skateboarding, soccer
8282.79 and then we'd find our trouble.
8284.71 But so post training nutrition.
8289.313 We're the same age, years
ago I was sort of neurotic
8293.59 about the idea that I had to ingest
8295.0 a certain amount of
carbohydrates and proteins
8297.22 within two hours then it
was 90 minutes of training.
8300.58 I confess I get, if I train hard,
8302.65 so I'm talking about
the resistance training
8303.97 not the running.
8304.9 But the resistance training,
60 to 90 minutes later,
8308.92 I'm really hungry.
8310.51 But there have been days when I just skip
8312.52 and then the hunger passes
and then later I eat more.
8315.22 I might eat twice as much later
8317.02 that's just the way
sometimes schedules go.
8319.12 But what are your thoughts in terms of
8321.46 the nutrition science, the
training related effects
8325.36 of the post-training meal?
8327.43 Is it something that you try to get?
8330.13 Is it something you think
people should pay attention to?
8332.95 - So that science has
actually probably been
8335.65 the one that's changed the
most in my lifetime, honestly,
8338.41 because, again, we're at the same age
8340.72 and I was falling for the same trap
8344.272 where I would really be focused on like,
8348.472 I'm risking speeding tickets
driving home from the gym
8351.58 to make you sure I got an anabolic window.
8354.1 Like I did all that, I really did.
8356.68 But thankfully that's been
sort of debunked in your body
8360.4 isn't just rushing through
these certain periods of time
8363.58 to utilize the nutrients in our body,
8365.08 but are able to partition
them and use them over a long,
8367.69 much greater duration.
8369.07 Up to now, they're saying,
8370.45 three to four hours after training,
8372.49 five hours after training,
8373.66 you could still see the
benefits of replenishment.
8376.785 A lot of that is just
8378.316 I think there's a
consistency element to it
8382.15 that just utilizing a post workout window
8386.8 or a post workout meal,
8388.51 even if it's within two hours or one hour
8391.09 is just integrating the habit of saying,
8393.28 listen, I just did this activity
8395.68 and now want to replenish
some of what I lost the energy
8398.44 that I used to perform
the exercises that I did.
8402.04 And just getting into
the routine knowing that
8405.489 the engine is ultimately
fed by what we put in it.
8409.6 And the concept of
replenishing the fuel lost
8414.04 is still a concept that I think again,
8416.02 different in mechanism but still important
8418.39 in terms of fueling the
overall performance.
8420.61 So the pre-workout period of time
8424.166 gives us a chance to
actually have a longer window
8428.08 because if those nutrients
are obtained pre-workout,
8431.53 it's not like they're gone in
that hour that you've trained,
8434.68 they're still there and
available for your body to use.
8436.6 So I think it's important
to get one of the two right
8440.47 or at least make sure you're consistently
8442.569 having one or the two
8445.36 or you might risk going
through all these periods
8448.33 of having no nutrition
to support your efforts.
8451.66 Not only will your
workouts potentially suffer
8453.43 in terms of the output,
8454.57 but then you're also
not providing your body
8456.67 any ability to capitalize
on an opportunity to feed it
8461.32 and refuel and recover.
8462.85 So I'm not very dogmatic
about what specifically to eat
8469.54 pre or post workout.
8471.46 But I do think you should have protein
8472.99 surrounding your training,
8475.69 whether that be ahead of time or after.
8478.0 Protein could be a
little bit hard to digest
8480.671 for some people.
8481.75 So if you do that pre-workout
8483.49 and then you're finding
your workout is slogging
8485.53 because you don't feel good
8487.0 then suddenly you put
that after your meal.
8489.16 But this whole concept
of the urgency of time
8492.07 has thankfully been removed
8494.71 and we can just learn to eat
a little bit more responsibly
8499.75 and drive more responsibly so we're not
8501.806 trying to rush home from the gym
8503.29 and risk killing people on the way.
8507.38 But I think it's great
because I think that
8509.23 that was something that it just showcases
8510.91 a belief that people had for so long
8513.309 that has since been proven
to be not that important.
8516.85 And there's a tip of the cap
towards research in a good way
8520.36 where it's like, all right,
8521.193 I think we could all agree
that this isn't necessarily
8523.218 true anymore.
8525.048 And look at yourself and say,
8527.421 oh my God, I did that so often.
8530.56 I bit that one hook line
and sinker but then realize,
8534.31 okay, we could always make a change.
8535.75 And the good thing about nutrition is
8537.19 those changes can happen the
very next time you go to eat
8539.74 and you'll start to see
the benefits of that.
8541.6 So I'm not a big believer
in that strict approach
8546.67 to pre or post-workout.
8548.991 I mean, even as far as
pre-workout supplements,
8552.991 a lot of people don't take them.
8554.23 A lot of people don't like
them, they don't take them,
8556.06 they don't like, they're not
necessarily even being used
8559.0 as the new nutritive
side of the pre-workout.
8562.18 They're just more used
to fuel the workout.
8565.214 - For me it's water and
some form of caffeine.
8569.17 - Yeah.
8570.003 I mean, it is whatever,
8571.18 again, I think it's important.
8572.41 I do think it's important to maintain
8573.82 a high level of output.
8575.08 So if your pre-work attrition requires
8578.32 a stimulant in order to help you do that
8580.27 or if your pre-work nutrition
8581.759 is causing you to have
a harder time to train
8585.01 because you're feeling full or stomachache
8587.8 or something else, then
that that's not achieving
8589.72 what you're trying to do.
8590.553 The ultimate goal is to
still be able to perform
8592.6 at the highest level.
8593.62 So whatever your nutrition is required
8595.169 to allow you to still do that,
8597.22 that is probably the most
important factor of all of it.
8599.8 - Great, I love the very
clear and rational approach.
8602.53 Don't ingest anything
right before your workout
8604.87 or near your workout
8606.58 that's going to make your workout worse.
8607.96 Yeah, and it's so simple
8609.67 and yet you don't hear this
8610.81 because I think people will think,
8611.74 oh, they must have a pre-workout
8613.33 they must have a post-workout.
8614.62 - No, again, even if the
benefits that are to be had
8617.514 from whatever's being suggested
8620.11 is going to be easily
offset by the fact that
8621.97 you can't perform at an output capable
8623.89 of driving any change.
8626.2 So that would pretty
much negate the fact that
8629.034 you're not outweighing those benefits
8631.33 of whatever nutritive approach you took
8633.489 and is struggling through your workout.
8635.59 - For me, the best pre-workout
is a good night's sleep,
8638.26 hydration, caffeine, and music.
8640.36 - Yeah, there you go.
8641.959 I mean, that's a simple formula.
8643.36 - It works.
8644.193 And then post what I do I
do find I get quite hungry
8646.33 and want to eat quite a bit more and...
8647.84 - Well, that's a natural
response the body's going to
8650.53 and most people want to do that
and I think it should be fed.
8653.14 I work out as you know,
8655.06 again, a lot of my postings
on Instagram will happen
8657.827 at 10 o'clock at night,
10:30 at night, 11 at night,
8660.55 'cause I am actually training there
8661.78 and that's where I'm
taking those little breaks
8663.07 in between sets to actually
film or post something.
8665.41 But like, I then go inside and eat dinner.
8667.45 So I'm eating at 11 o'clock at night.
8669.521 It's not necessarily ideal,
8671.8 I'm not recommending that
as a tool for anybody.
8673.87 I think it dispels one thing,
8675.31 I've never been a believer
in Kenny carbs after six.
8678.596 - That makes no sense to me.
8680.211 - [Jeff] Zero sense.
- Based on all the new,
8681.64 all the signs of metabolism
that I've seen makes no sense.
8685.091 I think as long as you
can, sort of like napping.
8687.07 I talked to Matt Walker, one
of the great sleep researchers
8689.65 wrote why we sleep, et cetera,
8691.48 and has his own podcast about
sleep, tremendous researcher,
8694.36 public communicator
about sleep and he said,
8696.4 naps are fine provided
they don't interrupt
8698.38 your ability to sleep well at night.
8700.6 Simple.
8701.433 Some people can sleep
from eight to 9:00 PM
8703.12 and then go to bed at
midnight and not a problem.
8704.86 Other people they take a
30 minute nap after lunch
8706.84 and they can't sleep at night.
8708.16 Same thing with-
8708.993 Caffeine's a little different
8709.87 because Matt would argue
the architecture of sleep
8711.91 can be disrupted, et cetera.
8712.93 But if you can eat dinner late
and eat carbohydrates late,
8716.47 I actually need carbohydrates at night
8717.82 in order to be able to sleep.
8719.38 Whenever I've done a low
carbohydrate type regimen
8722.8 in the evening, I have a
hard time falling asleep.
8724.78 I'm just too alert.
8726.01 And so I eat carbohydrates in the evening
8728.5 to restore glycogen
8729.7 but also in order to make
sure that I can fall asleep.
8733.277 - I actually can,
8735.22 again obviously it's
already late at night,
8736.99 by the time I'm done eating,
8738.07 but like I can fall asleep
within 5, 10 minutes
8740.83 of finishing my meal.
8741.97 Because I do think that they
have that same effect on me,
8744.885 but I'm never,
8746.324 I'm not bothered by the
feeling of fullness.
8749.2 I'm not unable to sleep because
of a feeling of fullness.
8752.92 But I do like the fact that
8756.01 I feel as if I'm at least replenishing
8758.32 what was lost through my hard training.
8760.15 And I do like to back it up with a dinner.
8762.64 I don't need to eat smaller amounts.
8764.5 Some people can't have that much.
8765.94 I will say after a hard leg workout,
8767.74 I don't have the same appetite
that I do after let's say,
8770.149 an upper body workout.
8772.03 It can really disrupt my
whole feeling of wellbeing.
8777.4 - You want to eat less
after you train your legs?
8779.813 - [Jeff] I do, yeah.
- Oh, wow, I'm the opposite.
8782.38 - No, 'cause I could
feel sick to my stomach.
8784.434 - You're clearly training harder.
8786.28 I've seen the way you train,
you do train very intensely.
8788.44 - Yeah.
8789.602 I think it's important.
8790.48 I mean, I think that...
8791.74 Again, it's that trade off between,
8793.81 if you're not going to train
for a long period of time
8796.686 then you're going to want to train harder.
8798.94 And again, I actually
feel like contrary to
8801.91 what people might think as you age,
8804.22 you're better off training harder
8805.99 for a shorter period of time.
8807.636 It's always within the
realm of safe training.
8812.11 I mean, I think that's
what I like to think
8813.917 that's what I bring to the table.
8814.84 Like an approach that's
smarter so I can train harder.
8818.17 Like not doing the dumb
things I did when I was a kid.
8820.893 And with that trade off
being a harder trainer,
8825.988 I think I get the results that I want
8828.79 because I'm able to really
push it and then back off
8831.52 and again, the meal feels like
almost a physiological reward
8836.527 for the hard effort I put in the gym
8838.33 knowing that I'm also replenishing
and setting the stage for
8842.23 the next day to be another
successful day of training
8845.26 or maybe not depending upon
how many times a day a week
8847.66 I train.
8848.812 I think that it's,
8852.197 It's a lot less,
8853.766 I hate to say but it's
a lot less scientific
8856.39 than we want to make it.
8858.88 And as it seems to be
coming back oftentimes
8861.82 like the thing that works for you
8863.17 is really the most important thing
8864.61 because ultimately
getting your ass in there
8866.53 and doing what you do
8867.37 is really the thing that
provides the best benefit.
8870.31 - Absolutely, and there are
many things that I would say
8873.76 are hallmarks of Jeff Cavaliere,
8875.32 but one of them is certainly consistency.
8878.2 You make it happen one way or another.
8880.6 - Huge. I mean, consistency
really is the determinant.
8884.35 And I know that that is
the hardest part for people
8886.847 that are, and why people tend
to look for the shortcut,
8890.32 'cause consistency is
the part that becomes
8893.53 the biggest challenge.
8894.4 But if you could find,
listen, if you could find the,
8898.51 you know through what I've
been trying to encourage here
8900.64 is like if you could find
the nutrition approach,
8902.16 if you could find the training approach,
8903.7 if you could try find the training split,
8905.17 if you could try all those
things that encourage you
8907.72 to want to go to the gym.
8908.62 Like you're locked in at
the point where you said
8910.27 you actually look forward to
going and doing your workout.
8913.39 - I love it.
8914.243 I look forward to, I mean, it's-
8915.815 Actually this morning,
8917.436 one of our teammates for the
podcast and I got to workout
8920.68 and halfway through I just
turned him and I said,
8922.75 I'll never figure out
why that feels so good,
8924.67 but it feels so good.
8925.69 I just, I really enjoy it and it lets,
8927.7 and I love to eat and it lets me eat right
8928.987 and I love the way it
makes me feel afterward.
8931.3 I don't understand this concept
of not enjoying the gym.
8933.7 Cardio's a little different,
8934.99 I always loathe the first
10 or 20 minutes of a jog.
8938.586 I mildly loathe the middle
third and by the end,
8942.64 I think this is the greatest thing ever,
8944.11 why don't want to do it all the time.
8945.31 And then that feeling evaporates
8946.51 before the next time I do it.
8947.68 - Yeah, of course I don't
even remember it either,
8949.27 after we get on, then do it again.
8950.92 - [Andrew] Exactly.
8951.753 - I think if people could,
8954.58 if we had one gift we
could give to everybody
8957.07 it would be the love of fitness.
8958.84 If they could be bestowed
the love of fitness
8960.94 it would change the entire world.
8962.86 But I think when you hear
things like this, that like,
8967.06 hey, that will work and that will work too
8968.83 and that this will work too.
8970.3 Rather than the dogmatic
one way only approach,
8974.92 which could become
discouraging for people.
8977.59 Then I think it becomes a
little bit uplifting like,
8979.63 well, I've never tried that.
8980.74 I've actually never
tried a total body split
8982.72 or I've never tried that style of eating.
8984.94 Like it becomes encouraging
that you might want to explore
8988.39 and then you might finally
get locked in and say,
8990.07 I really like this and then
you're off and running.
8992.461 - Some of what I so
enjoy about your content.
8995.791 We would be remiss if we
didn't briefly discuss Jesse.
9000.561 One of the great pleasures
for me in watching her content
9004.11 and learning from it over the
years is that you took on a,
9006.99 you decided to mentor somebody, Jesse.
9009.54 And there's some poking fun
9011.61 back and forth between the two
of you which is very amusing.
9013.89 But I have to say it
inspired me to do something
9016.86 early on in developing this podcast
9018.48 as I have a young intern who has helped me
9022.14 with some of the research
and he's a buddy,
9024.0 he's interested in science,
he's about to go off to college,
9026.1 but he also got really into fitness.
9026.933 So we would watch the videos of you guys.
9028.75 He was helping me get the
Instagram content out early on.
9032.28 And one thing that was just,
9033.27 it's such a pleasure to be
able to pass along knowledge
9036.0 and of course I'm learning from him.
9038.19 This is always the way it works.
9039.27 We learn from teaching and
we learn from students.
9041.44 But it's been great to see
Jesse's progress, it's amazing.
9044.94 I've gotten to meet him in person just now
9048.0 and he has grown, he's changed physically.
9051.48 And I think that you
mentioned a love of fitness.
9053.67 I think that one of the
best ways to be consistent
9056.484 is to take on the responsibility
of teaching others.
9059.4 Once one has proficiency in something.
9061.29 So maybe you just tell
us a little bit about
9064.2 how that's going.
9065.033 How is Jesse doing and
9066.685 where does he need a little
more work, where is he thriving?
9070.53 I'm impressed by the progress.
9072.12 - Well we have a, I mean,
9072.99 physically, we can
obviously see the changes,
9076.05 the list of things to
work on or is immense
9078.39 it's so long for him
to continue to improve.
9080.91 But no actually, in reality, Jesse,
9085.14 the story of Jesse was that
9086.28 I knew Jesse prior to
starting even Athlean-X.
9088.98 And a matter of fact,
I think the funny thing
9090.45 is the very first video that
was ever posted on my channel
9093.54 was a video that he shot as I don't know,
9096.673 a 13 year old or something.
9098.31 And I said, can you just
film this for a second.
9100.11 I was over there training
members of the family.
9102.93 So he then off went off to
college, went into film,
9107.285 realized he had much greener
pastures at Athlean-X
9110.85 instead of becoming the next
[indistinct] or something
9113.37 and he decided to come work with me.
9115.98 And the expectations in the beginning
9118.23 were just to edit videos
9119.91 or just to help with various aspects of
9124.2 like my day to day that
I don't think I was
9126.87 equipped to really handle and
grow the business anymore.
9128.91 So then look at by virtue of
being in that environment,
9134.25 there's an interest.
9135.083 I think if I worked in a gym,
9137.07 I might become interested in working out.
9138.87 And though that mine
was not a commercial gym
9140.67 it's sitting right
behind my office window,
9144.81 there became an interest
9145.8 in wanting to work out a little bit.
9147.51 And it wasn't even an
intentional experiment
9151.143 to put Jesse there.
9153.48 I just thought that he's
a very likable person.
9156.36 He has a very funny personality
9158.31 and he's also the, every man.
9159.948 In some ways as I'm sure
maybe you experience sometimes
9164.19 like I'm the guy that this
comes naturally for me
9167.61 is what people will say.
9168.443 Like, this is what you do for a living.
9170.194 Like this is what you-
9171.027 Like there's an element of disconnect
9172.8 in terms of the relatability
9174.87 because I do do this for a living.
9176.85 I can't deny that I do work
with professional athletes.
9179.4 So like there's a level
of interest in this
9181.17 above and beyond.
9182.31 But for him, he's just the
kid who wants to train.
9184.62 Maybe if he rolls out
of bed before 11:00 AM
9187.763 and doesn't have a date on Friday night,
9191.13 but that's the guy
everybody could relate to.
9193.26 And watching him transform
9195.578 and I love the fact that
even the interest level
9199.397 was up and down.
9200.88 Like it wasn't consistent
for him because he was like,
9204.24 part interested
9205.262 and then maybe not
interested for three months
9206.4 and then interested or not.
9207.233 And I never pushed it on him.
9208.8 This is again, this was no
orchestrated experiment for me.
9211.5 It was just like, if you want
to do this, then do this.
9213.81 And also from a standpoint
of like lending my help
9218.22 or expertise to him,
like I said, with my son,
9220.77 I'm not going to force it on anybody,
9222.15 I don't want to do that to anybody.
9223.32 I don't think that that's ever
going to spark that desire
9226.59 for long term adoption.
9228.54 So he got more interested,
9230.7 he started to learn more about it,
9232.02 he watched just the
videos that we're filming.
9233.76 He films the videos that we're filming
9235.29 and he's learning through what I'm saying
9236.79 he's becoming more of
a student of the field.
9239.637 And I have to say his knowledge
in the field has grown
9243.69 with the growth of his physique.
9245.85 And he's put into practice
some of the things that I say,
9248.49 he's put in practice some
things he hears other places
9250.68 and he winds up improving as he goes
9253.59 and he winds up starting to love this
9256.02 like he never thought he would.
9258.431 But it's great to see anybody grow
9262.77 and whether that be physically
or that be emotionally
9265.68 or whether that be just in their career,
9268.86 it's great to see somebody grow.
9270.21 And I like to tease him.
9272.855 Funny admission here,
9275.31 there are times when the
jabs that I will throw at him
9278.88 are something that we
might know ahead of time
9280.86 of what I'm going to say to him.
9282.53 People will say you're so mean to him.
9285.72 I can't believe it
you're that's so abusive.
9288.84 Like, dude, honestly, we
laugh after it's over.
9291.39 It's good, we're good.
9293.1 So of course, but like...
9295.02 - He's tougher than he
looks is what you're saying.
9296.64 - [Jeff] He's tougher
than he looks, believe me.
9298.2 - And he looks tough,
he's got the big beard.
9300.15 - He looks more manly than I do.
9301.41 I can't grow a beard, I don't,
9303.42 I mean, believe me, he's totally alpha
9305.67 and I'm like quickly becoming
the second star of this show,
9309.57 but like he's definitely contributed
9314.1 and people enjoy his presence for sure.
9316.74 - Yeah, I certainly do.
9317.73 And I think that as you pointed out,
9319.86 he's a kind of a proxy and
a template for everybody.
9323.025 We can relate to him because
9324.884 even though I've trained for many years,
9326.744 it's been a struggle through
graduate school, post,
9329.654 made it happen one way or another,
9331.41 but with more or less attention
9333.03 and admittedly through waxing
waning levels of motivation
9337.05 although I'm fortunate that I do enjoy it.
9339.33 - What I think is nice
about it too is that
9341.73 it's a realistic expectation that we set.
9345.48 'Cause you're showcasing
9347.55 what the journey actually looks like.
9349.14 And he's been on the journey
for again devotedly for
9353.16 let's say the last year and a half
9354.57 but on the journey for five years.
9356.304 If I could make the gains that he did
9359.88 starting when I started
training at 14, 15,
9364.5 and you're saying, hey, by 20,
9365.85 you're going to have the
strength levels he does,
9368.58 the physique that he does, the
knowledge that you've gained.
9371.67 Like that seems like a blink of an eye
9373.14 now looking back.
9374.606 At 46 years old, I'm like, holy cow.
9377.22 Like I think it took me
20 years, 15, 20 years
9381.114 to just even start to get into a groove.
9383.694 For him to do in a period of five years,
9386.82 it doesn't seem long
9387.81 whereas there's people that
will criticize his journey like,
9390.51 oh, it's just taking so long and so like
9393.09 there's such an instant
gratification that people seek,
9396.099 luckily that's the minority.
9398.01 Most people are like, this is amazing,
9399.669 but I think that it becomes
very uplifting because
9403.5 not only is it relatable
but the journey is real
9405.66 and people can appreciate that.
9408.39 Like, this is what will happen
9409.35 if you actually put in
consistent hard work
9410.94 and you'll watch him transform
9412.14 and go back and watch the
videos like you look at.
9413.73 We like to oftentimes throw
back to videos where he appeared
9417.03 as smaller Jesse but also shy Jesse.
9421.29 Arms crossed, head down,
9423.45 not making eye contact with the camera
9425.359 to where now he's got
his own skits and intros.
9428.599 It's like it's funny
because the confidence
9431.16 with the growth of physique
came confidence too,
9433.35 which is great.
9434.34 - Absolutely.
9435.6 Pretty soon it'll be his world
and we'll all be living in it
9437.97 as they say.
9439.65 Well, on behalf of myself
and all the listeners,
9443.79 I really want to thank you.
9445.204 First of all, for the discussion today,
9447.48 I learned an immense amount
9449.13 even though I thought I
knew your content well,
9450.9 I still learned an immense amount,
9452.43 many things we could deploy
from when to stretch,
9454.38 how to stretch, the skipping rope.
9456.064 We talked about nutrition,
we talked about heat cold
9459.33 training regimens.
9460.62 And what I love about all of this
9464.01 now that you've given us is that
9465.739 there's a backbone of logic
9467.839 and some consistent themes
indeed about consistency.
9471.3 But the logical backbone, I think is what
9474.094 will enable people to
really show up to the table
9477.3 and stay there for training
consistently over time.
9480.027 And as you said, the gift of
fitness is an immense gift.
9482.929 I can't thank you enough.
9484.668 I know you're an incredibly
busy human being with kids
9487.59 and dogs and a marriage and...
9489.333 - It's my pleasure.
9490.639 I'm happy I was able to make it work
9492.9 'cause I really I've been
watching your stuff for a while.
9495.12 And I really love the science of it,
9496.817 I like the way you think.
9498.453 And it's just, I'm just really fortunate
9502.32 that I was able to do it.
9503.22 - Oh well, I feel very
gratified in hearing that
9505.32 and honored to have you here.
9506.85 So thank you so much.
9507.99 - Thank you.
9508.86 - Thank you for joining
