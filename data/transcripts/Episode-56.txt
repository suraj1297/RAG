0.36 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
1.88 where we discuss science
and science based tools
4.93 for everyday life.
6.208 [Upbeat music]
9.29 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.5 and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
13.19 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.04 Today, we are going to
talk about the biology,
17.21 psychology and utility of play.
20.931 Play is something that
normally we associate
23.41 with children's games
25.2 and indeed with being a child,
27.74 much of our childhood
development centers around play,
30.82 whether or not it's organized play
32.32 or spontaneous play,
34.57 but as adults, we also need to play.
37.32 And today I'm going to talk about
39.03 what I like to refer to
as The Power of Play.
42.29 The Power of Play,
resides in plays ability
45.6 to change our nervous system
47.63 for the better,
48.63 so that we can perform many activities,
51.5 not just play activities, better.
54.49 Play can also function
56.11 as a way to explore new ways of being
58.89 in different scenarios in work,
60.83 in relationships, in settings of all kind,
63.48 and indeed also in the
relationship to oneself.
66.61 In fact,
67.443 we are going to explore how
assuming different identities
70.22 during the same game of play
72.9 or the same forms of play
74.72 has been shown to be immensely powerful
76.634 for allowing people
78.14 to engage in more creative thinking
80.08 and dynamic thinking and
indeed to better leaders
82.8 and more effective workers
84.14 and students and learners
and happier people.
87.534 I'm also going to cover
some data that shows
89.8 that learning to play properly
92.29 can enhance one's ability to focus
94.21 and is an active area of research
96.59 for treatment of things like ADHD,
99.47 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,
101.66 just as a little sneak preview
of where that's headed,
105.13 children who do not access enough play
107.96 during certain stages of childhood
109.83 are more prone to develop ADHD.
112.1 The good news,
112.933 is all of us regardless of
whether or not we have ADHD
115.5 or not,
116.333 whether or not we had ample access to play
118.85 during childhood or not,
120.79 can engage and grow the neural circuits
123.824 that allow for this
incredible power of play.
127.817 And this can be done again
at any stage of life today.
130.29 We're going to talk about the protocols,
131.52 the science, we will review all of that.
133.33 And I promise you'll come away
134.85 with a lot of knowledge,
135.786 whether or not you're a parent,
137.57 whether or not you're a child,
138.8 whether or not you're a person of any age,
140.71 you're going to have tools
141.61 and knowledge that will benefit you.
143.67 Before we begin,
144.503 I want to share with you
145.42 the results of what I think
to be an extremely exciting
148.37 and certainly an actionable study
150.03 that was just published in the
journal Scientific Reports.
153.33 This is an excellent journal
Nature Press journal,
156.25 Peer Reviewed, et cetera,
157.8 and the finding center around
159.9 what sorts of devices we
happen to be reading on
162.97 and accessing information on
164.28 and how that's impacting our physiology
166.92 and our capacity to learn.
168.94 One of the more frequent questions I get
170.61 is what are all these
devices, phones, tablets,
174.16 computers, video games et cetera,
175.73 doing to our brains.
177.27 And finally,
178.103 there's some good Peer reviewed data
179.53 to look at that and to
address it directly.
183.0 This study, first author Honma
184.84 H O N M A
186.64 Honma et al,
188.22 is entitled
189.053 "Reading on a smartphone
affects sigh generation.
192.02 That's SIGH sigh generation
193.82 brain activity and comprehension."
195.75 And to just summarize what they found,
198.53 they ran a study on 34 healthy individuals
203.04 and had them either read
material on a smartphone
207.42 or on regular printed paper or a book.
211.08 And what they found is that
212.59 comprehension on devices
in particular smartphones
215.671 is much poorer much worse than it is
220.13 when one reads on actual paper.
222.65 Now some of you may
experience this yourselves.
226.03 Now they compared smartphones with paper.
228.61 And what they found was
230.05 that when they looked
at people's breathing,
232.81 the normal patterns of breathing
234.29 that people were engaging in
235.5 did not differ between people
reading on a smartphone
238.51 or reading from paper.
240.74 However, one particular feature
of breathing did differ.
245.08 And that particular
feature is what we call
246.73 physiological sighs.
248.13 I've talked a lot about
physiological sighs on this podcast,
250.94 and on social media,
251.96 we had a terrific guest,
253.47 Professor, Jack Feldman from
254.78 University of California Los Angeles.
256.23 Who's a world expert in
breathing and respiration
259.25 and its impacts on the brain
260.86 and how brain controls
breathing and respiration
263.45 and what you can learn from that episode.
265.23 Or I'll just tell you again right now,
266.39 is that every five minutes or so,
268.72 whether or not we are asleep or awake,
270.18 we do what's called a physiological sigh,
271.91 which is a big, deep inhale,
273.75 often a double inhale
followed by a long exhale.
277.23 It goes something like this.
278.323 [Inhaling]
280.361 [Sighs]
282.44 Now you might think, oh,
I never breathe like that,
284.85 but you do,
286.01 unless there's something severely
wrong with your brain stem
288.54 every five minutes or so
290.04 you do one of these physiological sighs,
291.9 which reopens all the little
hundreds of millions of sacks
294.57 in your lungs called alveoli
296.27 that bring in more oxygen
as a consequence of that
298.77 big deep, double inhale.
300.53 And then you are able to
exhale carbon dioxide,
303.25 offload carbon dioxide
304.69 through that long exhale.
306.69 I've also encouraged people
to use the physiological sigh
309.18 deliberately,
310.013 not just spontaneously
310.901 as a way to reduce their stress quickly.
313.42 And indeed my lab works
on physiological sighs
315.63 and it's been exploring this
317.14 and they're quite effective in reducing
319.1 our stress very fast.
321.03 Reading on our smartphone,
322.64 seems to suppress physiological sigh.
325.0 People aren't aware that it's happening,
326.47 but it's happening.
327.35 Some people have talked
about so-called email apnea,
330.26 which is the fact that
people hold their breath
332.56 while they email or while they text.
334.22 And indeed many people do that.
335.42 This is distinct from
email or texting apnea.
338.49 What's happening here is
people are reading on the phone
340.93 and for whatever reason,
342.47 and I'll talk about what
the likely reason is,
344.64 but for whatever reason,
345.87 they're suppressing their sighing
347.66 And as a consequence,
349.07 the brain is not getting enough oxygen
351.03 and is not offloading
enough carbon dioxide.
353.56 And another finding in this study,
355.83 was that the prefrontal cortex,
357.48 an area of the brain that's
involved in focus and attention
359.9 and learning
360.733 becomes hyperactive in a kind
of desperate attempt to focus.
364.88 All of this can be summarized by saying,
366.84 if you happen to read on a device,
369.68 whether or not it's a tablet,
370.73 a standard computer screen of any kind,
373.0 but in particular on a smart phone,
375.01 regardless of how small or
large that smartphone screen is,
378.29 you want to remind yourself
379.59 to engage in these physiological
sighs fairly regularly.
383.4 And it might even be better to just
385.46 read the most or at least the key issues
389.16 and things that you're trying to learn
390.74 about the key information from paper,
392.68 either books or printed out material
394.37 of some other sort.
395.66 What's the underlying mechanism here?
397.07 Well,
398.02 one of the reasons I
like this study so much,
399.728 is that it brings together
two of my laboratories
402.56 and my particular
interests in neuroscience,
404.99 which is how does our visual system
406.7 and the aperture meaning the
size of our visual window
411.35 relate to our so-called autonomic function
413.36 or our internal state.
414.93 And basically what's happening here is
416.58 as any of us bring our visual
window in more narrowly
420.86 as we contract our visual window,
422.37 which is exactly what happens
423.62 when we're looking at a little
smartphone in front of us.
426.43 It seems to suppress
the breathing apparatus
429.14 because we know that physiological sighs
431.02 are controlled by a
specific set of neurons
432.94 in the brain stem called
the parafacial nucleus
434.74 discovered by Dr. Jack Feldman.
436.43 And so there must be a mechanism whereby
438.7 when we tighten our visual window,
440.2 we somehow, and we don't
know yet how this happens,
443.71 but somehow suppress the
activity of these neurons
446.42 in the parafacial nucleus
447.38 that generate this physiological sighs.
449.0 So again,
449.833 you have two choices or I
suppose you have many choices,
452.45 but two main choices
453.65 to contend with this new information.
455.22 One is that you remind yourself
458.01 to engage in deep breathing
459.28 and in particular, physiological sighs
460.79 every five minutes or so,
462.0 while reading anything or
texting on your smartphone,
465.12 the other would be,
465.96 again, if there's material
that you really need to learn
469.29 for sake of regurgitation later,
471.35 or for something particularly important,
473.353 try and read that from
either a larger screen
476.08 or even better would be from
printed materials or books.
478.98 Another reason I bring all that up
480.43 is that it relates to a larger theme,
481.9 which is that I get many,
many questions about ADHD
485.32 and about people's challenges with focus
487.6 and much of what we're
told these days is that
490.11 we are challenged with focus
491.33 because of the hundreds of videos
493.33 that we can see streaming by
us in any moment on our phone,
495.94 which probably is true.
497.59 The fact that the information
that we're reading
500.88 on the internet and on our phones
501.713 is emotionally disturbing
or distressing in some way.
504.29 And that probably is true
as well in many cases.
508.007 This study really points to
the fact that independent
511.24 of the information that we are looking at
513.24 or consuming
514.27 independent whether or
not it's movies or texts
516.32 or anything of that sort,
517.79 the mere size of the window, the aperture,
521.21 the screen that we are looking at
523.01 is also strongly impacting
our ability to learn
526.14 and remember information.
527.66 So broaden that visual window
529.368 print things out,
531.04 look at a book.
531.873 I didn't design the system.
534.5 I always say, you know,
535.49 however our visual system
and respiratory system
537.619 happened to evolve.
539.08 I wasn't consulted at the design phase.
540.64 This is just simply how
your brain circuits work.
543.23 So if you want to learn things,
544.41 widen that visual window and
even better print things out,
547.59 pick up a book or read on a tablet even,
550.41 but try and make that tablet larger
552.62 than a smartphone screen size.
554.49 Before we begin our discussion
about The Power of Play,
557.59 I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
559.27 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
562.16 It is however,
562.993 part of my desire and effort
to bring zero cost to consumer
565.61 information about science
and science related tools
568.29 to the general public
569.7 in keeping with that theme,
570.78 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
573.53 Our first sponsor is Athletic
Greens also now called AG1.
577.58 I started drinking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012.
580.47 And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.
583.01 Athletic Greens is an all in one
584.44 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
586.57 The reason I started drinking it in 2012,
588.91 and the reason that I still
drink it once or twice a day,
591.69 is that with Athletic Greens,
593.34 I cover all of my basic
foundational vitamin mineral
596.3 probiotic needs.
597.649 It's filled with adaptogens for recovery.
600.2 The probiotics are particularly important
602.16 because they encourage health
603.31 of the so-called gut microbiome.
605.33 We're going to be talking a
lot about the gut microbiome
607.068 on this podcast in the
weeks and months to come,
610.03 but to make a long story short,
612.04 we have a lot of bacteria
living in our gut
614.21 that are healthy bacteria
615.41 that support them like
digestion immune system,
617.51 metabolic function, hormone systems.
619.428 And perhaps most interestingly to me,
621.978 the gut microbiome
supports brain function,
624.66 including mood cognition and so forth.
627.41 The probiotics in Athletic Greens
628.88 strongly support the gut microbiome
630.68 and thereby the other systems of the body,
632.88 including the gut brain access,
634.93 which I just referred to.
636.34 If you like to try Athletic Greens again,
638.1 also called AG1,
639.29 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
642.57 to claim a special offer.
643.99 They're giving away five free travel packs
645.73 and a year supply of vitamin D3, K2,
648.75 vitamin D3 is extremely important
651.64 for many biological functions.
653.66 We are told that we can get
enough D3 from sun exposure,
656.11 but many of us we're getting sun exposure.
658.56 And many of us who are not
getting enough sun exposure
660.46 still don't have ample
levels of vitamin D3
663.31 So supplementing with
vitamin D3 is necessary
665.37 for many many people.
666.49 And K2 is important for
cardiovascular function
669.19 for proper calcium balance, et cetera.
671.86 So again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
674.63 you can get the five free travel packs
676.21 a year supply of vitamin the D3 K2,
678.42 and of course your Athletic Greens.
680.4 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
682.564 ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
684.79 that are of the absolute highest quality.
687.0 I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system.
689.44 And one of the many challenges
that your visual system
692.22 has to deal with
693.2 is for instance, when you
move from a bright environment
695.61 to a dimer environment, you have to adapt.
697.96 You have have to be able
to see things clearly,
699.54 many sunglasses and eyeglasses
don't allow that adaptation
702.32 to occur seamlessly,
703.68 ROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses
705.89 allow that to occur in
concert with your biology
708.58 and in a way that makes it very seamless.
710.38 You just don't notice
the transition at all,
712.51 which is wonderful.
713.42 I love it 'cause I don't have
to constantly be taking off
715.34 and putting on my
sunglasses when I'm outside.
717.49 I happen to wear readers at
night, eye glass readers.
719.95 It's also terrific as the luminance
721.53 in your environment changes.
722.592 So they work under low luminance,
724.34 high luminance, et cetera.
725.94 They're very lightweight.
726.9 In fact, you can wear them
when running, when cycling,
729.95 they were designed by
two All-American swimmers
732.61 from Stanford.
733.443 And so originally they were designed
734.61 for the purpose of being
worn during exercise,
736.99 but you can wear them anywhere.
738.49 They have a great aesthetic,
739.47 so you can wear them to dinner,
740.53 to work, et cetera.
741.563 And while a lot of performance
eyeglasses out there,
744.23 in my opinion, make
people look like cyborgs,
746.31 ROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses
747.78 have just a terrific aesthetic
749.07 that you can wear truly anywhere.
750.85 If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,
752.28 you can go to roka.com that's ROKA.com
755.62 and enter the code Huberman
756.93 to get 20% off your first order.
758.807 Again, that's ROKA ROKA.com
and enter the code Huberman
762.89 at checkout.
763.723 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.
766.58 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
768.57 that are second to none.
770.12 I started sleeping on a Helix
mattress about a year ago now,
773.41 and it's the best sleep
that I've ever had.
775.61 What's unique about Helix mattresses
777.362 is that they tailor their
mattresses to your sleep needs.
780.332 So if you go to their website,
782.47 you can take a brief two minute quiz
784.36 that asks questions like,
785.26 do you sleep on your stomach
786.38 or your back or on your
side, maybe you don't know,
788.24 do you tend to run hot or
cold throughout the night?
790.28 Or maybe you don't know,
791.24 and it matches you to the mattress.
793.08 that's perfect for your sleep needs.
794.73 I matched to the so-called Dusk mattress,
796.69 D U S K,
797.92 because I wanted a mattress
that wasn't too firm
799.95 and not too soft.
800.783 And so I sleep on a Dusk mattress.
802.138 You should figure out what
mattress would be ideal for you.
804.956 If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,
807.0 you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
809.044 take their two minute sleep quiz
811.38 and the match you to
a customized mattress.
813.21 And you'll get up to $200 off
815.47 any of your mattress orders
and two free pillows.
817.76 Again, that's $200 off
and two free pillows.
820.73 The pillows are excellent.
821.563 I also use Helix pillows.
823.0 They have a 10 year warranty.
824.27 You get to try out the mattress
825.67 for up to a hundred nights, risk free.
827.28 If you don't like it,
they'll come pick it up,
828.58 take it away.
829.43 But I think you'll love it.
830.86 Again if interested,
831.7 you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.
834.72 There can get up to $200 off
836.37 and the two free pillows.
837.91 Let's talk about play.
839.97 Now in researching this episode,
841.54 I thought that I was going to
come across a bunch of papers
844.31 that say this brain area
846.16 connects to that brain area,
847.76 which controls play in animals.
849.7 And there's similar areas
in babies and in adults.
852.63 And indeed, that's true.
853.6 And we will talk about brain circuitry,
856.12 but I think more
importantly is to understand
858.59 what is the utility of play?
860.61 You know, why do we
play when we're younger?
862.17 Why do we tend to play
less as we get older?
864.6 And what in the world is play for?
867.48 Some of us would be
categorized as more playful.
870.187 I'm sure that you know, people like this,
872.3 maybe you are like this
873.15 people that can walk into a room,
875.11 a social setting of any kind,
876.52 and they seem to already
kind of have a playful,
879.2 maybe even a mischievous
quality about them.
881.05 We'll talk about mischief
a little bit later,
882.86 but they sort of look at an environment
884.92 or a social setting as an opportunity
886.79 for different kinds of novel interactions.
889.28 Other people and I'd probably
put myself into this category.
891.832 If I walk into a novel environment,
893.87 I tend to be more in the
mode of just assessing
896.7 what that environment is like.
897.938 I'm not a particularly
spontaneously playful person,
901.07 although around certain individuals,
902.42 I might be more spontaneously playful.
904.93 We are all on a continuum
of this kind of seriousness
907.96 to playful nature.
909.577 Turns out that all young animals,
912.42 including humans
913.71 have more playfulness and tend to engage
915.95 in more spontaneous play
917.43 in their earlier years
918.45 than in their later years.
920.74 And therein lies a very interesting portal
922.98 to understanding what the utility,
925.59 what the purpose of play is.
927.62 First of all,
928.453 I want to lay down a couple
of key facts about play
931.85 that point to the fact that
play is not just about games.
935.67 Play is about much, much more
938.13 and play and in particular,
939.85 how we played as a child
941.905 and still how we can play as adults
944.58 is really how we test
946.02 and expand our potential roles
in all kinds of interactions.
950.72 One of the most important,
952.01 interesting and surprising
features of play
954.69 that I'd like everyone to know about
956.7 is that it is homeostatically regulated.
959.63 Some of you are familiar
with the term homeostasis.
961.65 Homeostasis is just this
aspect of biological systems
965.26 to try and remain in balance.
967.926 You know, if you stay awake
for a long period of time,
969.64 you tend to want to sleep
for a long period of time.
972.67 If you slept for a long period of time
974.27 and you're very rested,
975.103 then you tend to be very
energetic the next day.
976.81 And of course, I know people
out there will immediately say,
978.9 oh, well, if I sleep too long,
980.15 then I'm groggy the next day.
981.25 Of course there are exceptions,
982.62 but in general,
983.579 sleep and wakefulness are
in homeostatic balance.
987.9 Thirst and water consumption
are in homeostatic balance.
991.07 If you don't drink any fluids for a while,
992.81 you tend to get more thirsty,
994.18 you drink fluids
995.59 and your thirst tends to diminish
997.47 likewise with food.
998.66 Likewise, with most all
motivated behaviors.
1001.58 Well,
1002.413 one of the most important discoveries
1003.37 of the last century,
1004.498 was largely the work of a
guy named Jaak Panksepp.
1007.69 No, it's not Jack it's Jaak Panksepp
1010.16 who really pioneered this understanding
1012.32 of the biology of play
1013.95 and relating that to
the psychology of play
1015.87 in animals and humans.
1017.24 He's considered kind of
luminary in the field of play,
1021.217 and what a great title to have, right?
1022.87 If you could have a title
and be a scientific luminary,
1024.73 you might as well be the, the play guy.
1026.99 In fact he was known and I'll
get into this later as to why,
1029.95 but he was known as the "Rat Tickler"
1032.18 because he tickled rats.
1033.36 And he actually found that
rodents and animals of many kind
1036.47 generate laughter in response to tickling.
1039.28 And in fact,
1040.22 they don't have the capacity
to tickle themselves
1042.68 something we'll also
talk about why that is.
1044.72 And he was called the "Rat tickler,"
1046.66 but then he discovered that
many species of animals
1049.63 engage in laughter in response to tickling
1051.49 and they tickle each other.
1052.78 And the reason you don't
hear them laughing,
1054.73 no you can't hear your dog laughing
1056.33 that isn't laughing it's something else
1058.14 is that most animals besides humans laugh
1061.41 at kind of ultrasonic
levels of auditory output.
1065.5 Meaning the frequencies
of sound are just too high
1067.82 for you to hear,
1068.653 but with the appropriate devices,
1069.583 he was able with his colleagues
1071.7 to isolate this so-called
the "Rat Laughter"
1074.78 and then turns out there's kitten laughter
1076.43 and there's puppy laughter.
1077.55 And of course there's human laughter.
1079.34 So Jaak Panksepp was a very interesting
1081.1 and pioneering person in this field.
1083.32 And he also discovered that play
1085.92 is homeostatically regulated.
1087.53 Meaning if animals including children
1089.92 are restricted from playing
for a certain amount of time,
1092.73 they will play more when
given the opportunity
1095.22 in the same way that
if I food restrict you
1096.95 for a long period of time,
1097.977 you'll eat more when you
are finally allowed to eat.
1100.27 Now this is important
1102.55 because it moves this thing that we call
1105.13 play from the dimension
of higher order functions
1108.55 or things evolved recently,
1110.722 you know, that are really
kind of at the front edge
1114.45 of human evolution,
1115.654 deeper into the circuitry of the brain,
1119.22 whereby we say the brain stem,
1121.96 the kind of ancient parts of the brain
1123.91 are going to be involved.
1124.82 And in fact, that's the case
1126.21 as we're going to learn
later in the podcast,
1128.312 play is generated through the connectivity
1131.66 of many brain areas.
1133.23 But one of the key brain areas
1134.77 is an area called PAG Periaqueductal Gray.
1139.14 The Periaqueductal Gray
is a brain stem area.
1142.194 So it's pretty far back
1144.03 as the brain kind of transitions
into the spinal cord.
1146.66 And it's rich with neurons
that make endogenous opioids.
1150.99 So these are not the kinds of opioids
1152.55 that are causing the opioid crisis.
1154.9 These are neurons that you and I all have
1157.82 that release endogenous, meaning self-made
1160.12 or biologically made opioids.
1162.62 They go by names like enkephalin
1164.51 and things of that sort.
1165.934 Play evokes small amounts of
opioid release into the system.
1171.6 They kind of dope you up a little bit,
1173.41 not so much as one would see if
1176.66 one were to take exogenous opioids.
1178.28 And in fact exogenous
opioids as we now know,
1181.2 are potentially very hazardous,
1183.91 highly high addiction potential
1185.73 high overdose potential.
1186.81 They cause all sorts of problems.
1188.21 Yes there are clinical uses for them,
1189.79 but they're causing a
lot of problems nowadays,
1191.49 but these endogenous opioids
1193.17 are released in children and adults
1194.68 anytime we engage in play.
1197.54 And that turns out to be a
very important chemical state
1200.58 because there's something about
1201.87 having an abundance of
these endogenous opioids
1204.3 released into the brain
1205.702 that allows other areas of the brain,
1207.72 like the prefrontal cortex,
1209.08 the area of the front that's responsible
1210.65 for what we call executive function.
1212.12 Executive function is the
ability to make predictions,
1214.38 to assess contingencies.
1216.92 Like if I do this,
1218.23 then that happens.
1219.063 If I do that, then that happens.
1220.61 Well prefrontal cortex is often seen
1222.57 as a kind of rigid executive
of the whole brain.
1225.86 That's one way to view it,
1227.18 but probably a better way to view it
1228.62 is that the prefrontal cortex works
1230.69 in concert with these other
are more primitive circuitries.
1234.07 And when the periaqueductal gray releases
1237.7 these endogenous opioids during play,
1240.2 the prefrontal cortex, doesn't get stupid.
1242.76 It actually gets smarter.
1244.26 It develops the ability
to take on different roles
1247.83 and explore different contingencies.
1249.88 And we're going to talk about role play
1251.53 later in different contexts.
1253.05 And what we will find
is that so much of play
1256.17 is really about exploring things in a way
1259.64 that feels safe enough to explore, right?
1262.82 This is not what happens
when we drive down the street
1264.98 or when we bike down the street,
1266.154 when we are headed to work,
1267.73 commuting on our bicycle
or walking or driving,
1270.0 we tend to be very linear
1271.22 and we tend to be very goal directed.
1272.87 We're not going to just take
a new street just because
1275.25 we're not going to be
spontaneously riding in the middle
1277.9 of the road
1278.733 and then on the sidewalk
and then back and forth.
1280.25 Although I can remember as a kid,
1281.23 I was doing some of that.
1282.063 I like to jump off curb
cuts when I was a kid.
1283.67 And then eventually I
graduated, sorry to the cyclist,
1286.41 but I graduated to skateboarding.
1287.84 And then I look on skateboarding.
1289.39 You're always kind of exploring terrain,
1290.45 but you know, as I got older,
1291.99 actually I find myself
becoming much more linear.
1293.9 I just don't play with
my commute very much.
1296.44 It's really just about getting
to work and then working.
1299.61 When endogenous opioids are in our system,
1301.88 when we're in this mode of play,
1304.82 the prefrontal cortex starts seeing
1307.32 and exploring many more
possibilities of how we interact
1310.74 with our environment,
1311.95 with others and the roles that
we can assume for ourselves.
1315.76 And so we're going to dissect one by one,
1318.39 the different aspects of play,
1320.04 role play, social play,
1321.57 individual play, imaginary
play, competitive play
1324.393 they are enormous number
of dimensions of play.
1326.65 And by the end of this episode,
1328.139 we are going to arrive
at a very key feature.
1331.16 The key feature is one that's called
1333.8 your personal play identity.
1336.15 All of us have what we call
a personal play identity.
1339.84 This personal play identity
1341.25 was laid down during development.
1343.2 And it is the identity that you
assume in playful scenarios.
1347.6 And it is identity that you
adopt in non playful scenarios.
1351.597 Now the great news is that
your personal play identity
1354.82 is plastic throughout
your entire lifespan.
1357.13 You can adjust your personal play identity
1358.98 in ways that will benefit
you in work in relationships
1361.84 and your overall level of happiness.
1363.44 We will discuss protocols
and ways to do that.
1365.99 But I do want to give
a nod to the late jack,
1369.16 Jaak excuse me,
1370.323 Jaak Panksepp, "The rat tickler."
1373.27 And I also want to just give
a nod to play generally,
1376.57 as we move forward in the discussion.
1377.94 What I'd love for everyone to do
1379.41 is to stop thinking about
play as just a child activity,
1383.265 not just a sport related activity,
1387.11 but really as an exploration
in contingencies.
1390.64 Again, it's an exploration of,
1393.24 if I do A, what happens?
1395.29 If I do B, what happens?
1396.89 If someone else takes on
behavior or attitude C
1401.39 what am I going to do?
1402.74 And play is really where
we can expand our catalog
1406.21 of potential outcomes,
1407.54 and it can be enormously enriching.
1409.64 And indeed as we'll talk about
the tinkerers of the world,
1413.73 the true creatives,
1414.949 the people that building
incredible technologies and art,
1418.7 and also that just have incredibly rich,
1420.71 emotional and intellectual
and social lives
1423.4 all have a strong element of play.
1426.07 And so today I hope to convince you
1427.64 of some protocols that
will allow you to expand
1430.13 your various roles in life,
1431.55 through the portal of play.
1433.31 So we establish that play is homeostatic,
1435.8 meaning we all need to do it.
1437.61 Many of us, including myself,
1439.593 haven't played that much as adults.
1441.96 We're all pretty busy.
1443.33 Number of us are stressed.
1444.36 We got a lot to do in life,
1445.372 but as children,
1447.24 most all of us engage in a lot of play.
1450.283 And in looking at the way
that very young children
1454.0 and especially toddlers play,
1456.12 we can learn a lot
1457.46 because it reveals the fundamental rules
1459.97 by which the toddler brain
interacts with the world.
1463.42 Now,
1464.253 one of the key things
1465.45 about the baby brain
1467.03 is that the baby brain somehow
1469.37 knows that it can't do
everything in the world, right?
1472.59 If a baby needs something,
1475.12 it generally will cry or make
some sort of vocalization
1478.87 or some sort of facial expression
or combination of those.
1481.65 And the caretaker, whoever
that may be will provide it.
1484.21 This is an ancient hard wired mechanism
1486.37 whereby the so-called
autonomic nervous system
1488.27 that generates stress
1489.51 will create this kind of
whining and discomfort,
1491.98 maybe arriving,
1492.92 maybe the baby gets
kind of red in the face
1495.18 and the caretaker delivers some thing
1498.69 based on a good guess
of what that baby needs.
1502.44 So maybe it's breast milk,
1503.98 maybe it's bottle milk.
1505.24 Maybe it's a diaper change.
1506.76 Maybe it's to be warmed
up if the baby is cold,
1509.22 maybe it's to be cooled
down if the baby's too warm,
1511.49 maybe if the baby's in
its a little onesie thing,
1513.59 it's feeling restricted
and it just wants to move
1515.48 and they'll get taken out of their,
1517.093 their crib or their stroller,
1518.81 whatever it is and allowed
to stretch out on the floor.
1521.29 Remember the baby doesn't
know exactly what it needs.
1523.46 It only knows the state of discomfort.
1525.95 And of course we don't know
exactly what babies and toddlers
1528.57 are thinking
1529.44 because they can't express
themselves with language yet.
1532.36 But what's key to understand
1533.65 is the rule or the
contingency that is set up
1536.18 in that scenario.
1537.18 In that scenario,
1538.62 the child feels some discomfort
1542.34 expresses that discomfort verbally
1544.28 or through a facial expression or both
1546.17 and then some force some
person from the outside world
1550.76 resolves it.
1551.93 And so the very young baby
1553.873 and indeed many children
up to certain ages
1556.57 and let's confess many adults
1559.31 are not able to meet or
adjust their internal states
1562.53 of stress.
1563.363 And so they look to
things outside of them.
1564.69 That's the first rule,
1565.96 the fundamental rule
1567.19 that we all learn when we come into life,
1569.16 that when in a state of discomfort
1571.135 to look outside our immediate biology,
1574.493 beyond the confines of our
skin and find a solution,
1577.95 a sip of water for adults,
it might be sip of alcohol,
1581.07 right?
1581.903 Probably not the best
tool to relieve stress,
1583.53 but that's one that many people do.
1584.72 In fact engaging for
the baby that's hungry.
1587.07 The bottle milk comes from the outside.
1588.79 As we gain more proficiency
in moving through life
1591.15 and we can get things for ourselves.
1592.97 We still often bring things
from the external world in
1595.382 to resolve this what I'm calling
1597.96 autonomic discomfort or
autonomic dysregulation.
1603.584 That's not a game, but that's a rule.
1607.17 As we advance from infant to toddler,
1610.36 we start to think more
in terms of where we are
1613.98 and what we own relative to
what's out there in the world.
1618.04 And now in the world of child psychology,
1620.74 there's a somewhat famous poem
1622.65 that was written by a
research child psychologist.
1625.81 His name was Burton White,
1627.24 and he wrote a poem called
"The Toddlers Creed"
1629.847 "The Toddlers Creed" defines well,
1631.99 what the rules and
contingencies of play are
1635.52 in very young children.
1636.75 And it reveals to us just how narrow
1639.59 and limited their world view is
1642.13 and how self entered their world is.
1644.91 So "The Toddlers Creed" read quickly,
1646.84 cuz' I don't want to take up
too much time with this is.
1648.737 "If I want it.
1649.69 It's mine.
1650.74 If I give it to you and
change my mind later,
1653.33 it's mine."
1654.163 For anyone that's played with a toddler,
1655.21 you can imagine this in your mind.
1656.727 "If I can take it away
from you, it's mine.
1659.48 If I had a little while ago, it's mine.
1662.45 If we are building something together,
1664.013 all the pieces are mine.
1666.09 If it looks just like mine,
1667.6 it's mine.
1668.73 If it's mine, it will never
belong to anyone else,
1671.13 no matter what."
1672.482 And of course, as we hear this
1675.44 sounds quite awful, right?
1676.73 And yet this is actually
a reflection of what
1679.04 a healthy toddler would
think about the world.
1681.89 That the objects and things,
1683.3 and even the people in
the world are theirs,
1686.19 that they are actually
possessions that belong to them.
1688.56 Now of course,
1689.49 some people never actually
transition beyond this stage
1691.82 of moral and social development.
1694.35 And there are indeed some adults
1696.243 that fit "The Toddlers Creed."
1698.13 And you're welcome to
share this with them.
1700.014 If ever you think that
it might be of benefit
1702.31 to their self-reflection.
1704.19 But in all seriousness Burton White's
1707.457 "Toddlers Creed" is really grounded
1709.95 in this transition from
when we are infants.
1712.52 And we have to have
things delivered to us,
1714.75 to the point where we are toddlers
1716.44 and we can access things in the world,
1718.51 but we tend to assume
that they are all ours.
1720.83 And then the next stage
1722.73 is the really key stage
as it relates to play
1724.87 because is in the next
stage of development
1727.46 is where young children start
1729.31 to interact with other children
1730.81 and there's an exchange and a possession
1733.34 and then a letting go of certain things,
1735.79 learning that not everything is yours
1738.11 and that the entire world is not about you
1740.19 is one of the key contingencies
1741.99 that is established during play.
1744.67 It's one of the key way
in which children go
1747.22 from being very self-centered
1749.01 and basically unable to
engage with other kids
1751.37 for very long,
1752.203 without some sort of eruption of crying
1754.08 and some sort of battle of, you know,
1756.4 kind of push pull over an object
1758.3 to things like sharing and
things like cooperative play.
1761.56 So as we transition from forms of play
1763.72 that are all about the self
1765.14 that are all me, me, me, me,
1766.367 "The Toddlers Creed"
1767.435 to forms of play that involve
1769.502 some discomfort in assuming roles
1772.24 that maybe we don't want and
not getting what we want.
1775.051 It's really an opportunity for the brain
1777.98 to start to explore different
roles that people take,
1781.37 how they work as individuals
1782.7 and as pairs and in larger groups.
1785.22 And to do that in a low
stakes environment, right?
1789.3 You wouldn't want this to be worked out
1791.35 on the battlefield or
when searching for food
1793.89 or in some high stakes environment
1795.88 where the survival of the
species was important.
1799.16 It appears that these
circuitry for play evolved.
1801.92 So that rules and contingencies
around who's most important,
1806.46 whether or not the group is important,
1807.84 whether or not individuals
are going to be leaders
1809.87 or followers, et cetera,
1811.24 that can be explored in
a low stakes environment.
1813.75 Now there are hundreds of
different types of play
1815.86 and hundreds of different
types of contingency testing.
1818.61 But the key theme here is that
1820.53 play allows children and
adults for that matter
1824.95 to explore different outcomes
1826.82 in a kind of low stakes environment.
1828.57 If you're playing a board
game or a card game,
1830.213 you might get really into that game,
1832.37 but unless there's a lot of
money on the table, so to speak,
1834.57 or you're really playing
for something important
1836.64 or unless your ego is swollen
way out of proportion,
1839.03 to reality,
1840.22 if you lose, you might
not feel good about it,
1842.47 but it's truly not the end of the world.
1844.07 And if you win,
1845.17 you might feel really good about it,
1846.44 but you're not really incredible.
1848.24 You were just incredible in
that particular situation
1851.09 for that particular moment,
1852.25 it doesn't really transform
the rest of your life,
1854.88 unless that game is of a
particular type for sport
1857.52 for instance.
1858.86 We'll talk about sport later.
1860.55 So the key theme here is that
play is contingency testing.
1864.74 play is contingency
testing under conditions
1867.58 where the stakes are sufficiently low,
1870.46 that individuals should feel comfortable
1872.55 assuming different roles,
1873.66 even roles that they're
not entirely comfortable
1876.51 within their outside life.
1878.59 And that all relates again
1880.18 to the release of these
endogenous opioids,
1882.42 in this brain center periaqueductal gray
1884.46 and the way that it allows
the prefrontal cortex
1886.98 in a very direct way I mean,
1888.2 truly it allows it in a biological way
1890.423 to expand the number of
operations that it can run,
1894.64 and start thinking about, oh, well, okay.
1897.54 Normally I'm kind of a loner
1899.24 and I like to read and work
1900.932 and you know, hang out
alone maybe and play alone
1903.14 but you know okay,
1904.01 I'll play a board game
1904.93 or a game of tennis
1906.24 where I have a partner and
we're going to play as partners
1907.99 against two other people.
1909.08 Okay, that's a little
uncomfortable, but I'll do it.
1911.8 And in doing that,
1912.68 you discover certain ways
1914.0 in which you are
proficient in certain ways,
1915.92 in which you are less proficient,
1917.58 you discover that the other person
1919.09 actually tends to cheat a little bit
1922.01 or the other person is
extremely rigid about the rules,
1925.15 or maybe it is extremely rigid
about the way they organize
1927.68 their pieces on the board,
1929.13 or they're crossing the line
1930.29 into your side of the tennis court.
1931.76 There are all sorts of
things that we learn
1933.54 in these rather low stake scenarios.
1935.68 That's the key theme here.
1937.35 So before I continue,
1938.54 I just want to point to a
tool that anyone can use,
1941.66 but in particular, the
less playful of the group.
1944.86 And I would put myself into this category.
1947.37 Again, I'm not somebody who really engages
1949.04 in spontaneous play.
1951.092 I enjoy sports.
1952.45 I enjoy exercise,
1953.62 but that is distinct from play
1954.99 because the sports and
exercise that I engage in,
1957.06 I take pretty seriously.
1958.15 They're not low stakes for me.
1959.89 I put actually I put a
lot of importance on them.
1961.98 Which is I'm saying all this,
1962.82 I probably should put a
little less importance on them
1964.53 and have a little more fun with those.
1966.28 And yet what I'm about to tell you is that
1969.259 anyone and everyone can
benefit from engaging
1973.37 in a bit more of this playful mindset,
1976.54 the playful mindset is not necessarily
1978.61 about smiling and jumping
around or being silly.
1981.97 That's not it at all.
1982.803 It's not Tigger character
1984.68 from "Winnie the Pooh" necessarily.
1986.28 It could be,
1987.37 but it's really about allowing yourself
1990.92 to expand the number of outcomes
1994.09 that you're willing to entertain
1995.43 and to think about how you relate
1996.56 to those different outcomes.
1997.96 So what this means is putting yourself
2000.02 into scenarios where
2001.17 you might not be the top performer, right?
2004.04 Playing a game that you're
not really that good at.
2006.14 I had this experience recently,
2007.353 friends that like to play cards,
2009.25 they like to do some low stake gambling.
2010.96 This is non illegal gambling ring.
2012.42 They play for trivial things.
2014.21 And I generally don't buy into the game.
2018.22 I generally don't play
2019.61 mostly because they end
up winning and taking
2022.04 whatever it is that I have.
2023.71 But in the mode of assuming
a more playful spirit,
2027.22 the idea would be well,
2028.33 if the stakes are low enough,
2030.52 then to play simply for
the sake of playing,
2032.81 because there's something to learn there
2034.3 about the other people in the group
2035.84 and about one's self
2037.27 and how one reacts to things like
2040.23 someone who's clearly trying
to take everybody's money
2043.44 or somebody who is clearly trying to cheat
2047.512 or somebody who's clearly very, very rigid
2050.51 about every last detail,
2051.73 including how the cards are
dealt and shuffled right?
2054.113 There is learning in this exploration.
2056.85 And that is at a biological
level, the prefrontal Cortex,
2060.87 starting to entertain
different possibilities,
2063.43 starting to entertain different outcomes
2065.07 in this low stakes way.
2066.29 And if you think about it,
2067.71 that's not something
that we allow ourselves
2069.88 to do very often.
2071.292 Even if we listen to new forms of music
2073.7 or we go see new art or new movies,
2076.35 those are new experiences,
2077.54 but that's not us making new predictions
2079.86 about what's going to happen next.
2081.25 It's not the brain working to figure out
2083.62 new possibilities.
2085.06 And so you can immediately see how
2086.78 just a small increase in your willingness
2090.07 to put yourself into conditions
2091.62 where you don't understand
all the rules perhaps,
2093.5 or you're not super
proficient at something,
2096.33 but you enter it
2097.48 because it is low stakes.
2099.36 And because there is information to learn
2101.09 about yourself and others
2102.29 could start to open up these
prefrontal cortex circuits.
2105.3 And when I say open up,
2106.56 I don't mean that literally
there's an opening
2108.33 in your skull.
2109.163 What I mean is that your prefrontal cortex
2112.02 can work in very rigid ways.
2113.56 Meaning if A then B,
2115.11 if I go down this street turn
left and go that way to work,
2118.08 it is fast.
2118.913 If I go down the other street, it's slow.
2120.13 If there's a traffic jam there,
2121.38 I'm going to go there
2122.36 but it's starting to explore
different possibilities.
2124.64 And there are very, very
few opportunities in life
2128.34 to explore contingencies
in this low stakes way,
2131.019 such that it engages neuroplasticity,
2133.31 the prefrontal cortex.
2134.8 So play is powerful
2136.67 at making your prefrontal
cortex more plastic,
2140.34 more able to change in
response to experience,
2142.29 but not just during the period of play,
2145.05 but in all scenarios,
2146.4 because you get one prefrontal cortex,
2147.9 you don't get a prefrontal
cortex just for play.
2150.15 You get a prefrontal cortex
that engages in everything.
2153.34 So going forward,
2154.173 I will layer on some more
concrete aspects of tools,
2158.22 but for now,
2159.053 if you're somebody that
doesn't consider yourself,
2160.56 particularly playful
2161.8 consider,
2162.633 and maybe even engage in
just a little bit of play
2165.431 in some way,
2166.97 that is of discomfort to you
2168.81 with the understanding that is increasing
2170.998 your prefrontal cortical plasticity.
2173.55 Another really interesting
and important aspect of play
2177.01 is so-called play postures.
2179.24 These are seen in animals,
2180.54 and these are seen in humans.
2182.42 And for those of you that
are watching this podcast
2184.48 on YouTube, I'll do my
best to adopt them here.
2187.45 For those of you that are listening,
2188.44 you'll just have to imagine
them in your mind's eye,
2191.15 but Jaak Panksepp and
indeed Darwin himself,
2195.04 study these play postures
2196.83 that all animal engage in.
2198.538 Perhaps the most familiar one
2201.71 is seen in dogs and in wolves
2204.34 where they will lower
their head to the ground
2206.41 and they'll put their
paws out in front of them
2208.0 and they will make eye contact
2209.82 with another typically dog or wolf
2212.678 to so-called call the play.
2215.36 Now, when they do this posture,
2217.34 it's obvious that they're
lowering themselves.
2219.07 They're not in an aggressive stance,
2221.67 because they're lowering their head.
2223.25 And this is universally known
among canines as play posture.
2226.523 There's some famous videos online.
2228.44 You can look these up
2229.56 of dogs actually doing this with bears
2232.01 that they're confronted with
2233.35 and the bears, at least in these videos
2236.238 in exchange also lowering their head,
2238.74 and there you see bear
dog playful interactions.
2242.208 Now you always have to be
cautious with bears in general.
2245.81 I would say you have to
be cautious with bears,
2247.47 but this speaks to the
universality of this bowing,
2252.01 this sort of the, the,
2252.86 what some people call the puppy bow
2254.17 or the play bow that dogs do
2256.15 turns out that humans do this as well.
2257.91 Although in a different form,
2259.22 I'm sure there are some that go into the,
2260.72 the down-dog play posture,
2262.14 but more typically when
humans want to play,
2265.24 they will do a subtle or
not so subtle head tilt.
2268.95 The head tilt with eyes open
2270.82 is considered the universal head
2272.94 and facial expression
posture of play in humans.
2276.0 So when two people see one another,
2277.7 if they are aggressive
towards one another,
2281.528 they will assume certain facial
expressions and postures.
2283.06 But if they're feeling
playful towards one another,
2284.9 oftentimes they'll tip
their head to the side
2286.5 just a little bit and
they'll open their eyes.
2288.24 They might even raise
their eyebrows briefly.
2290.5 This has been seen again
and again and again.
2292.71 Another hardwired feature
of so-called play postures
2296.63 is what's called soft eyes.
2298.7 When animals are aggressive,
2300.3 or when they're sad,
2302.1 they tend to reduce the
size of their eye openings
2304.92 by basically making their
eyelids closer together,
2308.38 somewhat,
2309.213 by keeping their eyes together
2310.046 in particular for aggression,
2310.879 they'll bring their eyes towards
2311.97 what we call a vergence eye movement.
2313.35 Bring it towards the center
2314.49 that actually narrows the
aperture of the visual field.
2318.81 When people or animals
want to engage in play,
2321.31 they tend to open their eyelids somewhat,
2323.64 and they tend to purse their
lips just a little bit.
2325.9 So it's not like stronger
pursing when your lips like this,
2328.08 it's, pursing their lips.
2329.26 They'll open their eyes a little bit.
2330.31 And they'll often do
the head tilt as well.
2331.89 Sometimes with a little bit of a smile.
2333.7 These are reflexive
these are not trained up.
2336.19 Children do this.
2337.23 Adults do this dogs, wolves do this.
2340.5 Even certain birds will do this.
2342.48 Most birds have eyes on
the side of their heads,
2344.11 but they do a sort of form
of this soft eyes approach.
2346.7 And certainly in raptors,
2347.95 you see a softening of the eyes
2349.2 and indeed raptors like Hawks and Eagles
2351.67 they actually do have
a certain form of play,
2353.63 but only early in life.
2355.186 The other thing that we see during play,
2357.84 or what are called partial postures,
2359.74 partial postures are a
kind of play enactment
2363.146 of postures that would
otherwise be threatening.
2366.19 So a partial posture that we
see during play in animals
2370.27 and humans that relates
to aggressive play.
2372.95 So things like wrestling
2374.24 or things like rough and tumble play,
2376.04 which is very common in animals
and kids and some adults.
2379.145 Is that because there's going
to be physical interaction
2382.618 in animals,
2384.19 what will happen is
2385.396 they will march toward one
another often very slowly,
2388.71 but rather than having their hair up,
2391.33 which is we call piloerection,
2393.11 which is when the hair goes up,
2394.24 animals do this to make
themselves look bigger.
2395.84 Think of about the, the cat.
2396.8 That's trying to look bigger or an animal
2398.62 that's being aggressive,
trying to look bigger
2400.46 in the presence of a foe,
2404.6 a different animal that
they're either going to try
2406.48 and kill or fight in some way,
2408.11 even if it's to defend themselves,
2410.09 partial postures occur
when animals will approach
2412.95 one another,
2413.783 but they'll keep their fur down.
2415.54 Humans will do this to,
2416.539 they will approach during play,
2419.1 but unless it's highly competitive play
2421.14 like a football game or a boxing match,
2423.88 they will actually shrink
their body size somewhat.
2426.37 We have hair on our bodies,
2428.028 some of us more than others,
2429.627 and that hair is capable of piloerection.
2433.29 It can stand up.
2434.123 That's the hair standing
up on end phenomenon,
2436.605 but most of us don't have
enough hair on our bodies
2439.65 that we can actually use that
to make ourselves larger.
2442.75 So what you see with people
who are about to engage in play
2446.07 is they tend to make their
body a little bit smaller
2448.71 unless they are highly competitive
2450.47 and highly competitive play
2452.01 is its own distinct form of play.
2453.58 That we'll talk about later,
2454.45 such as during sport,
when the stakes are high,
2456.97 a Super Bowl football game,
2459.88 I'm revealing my ignorance
about sports here.
2461.688 The Super Bowl as it's typically called
2464.74 is a very high stakes game, right?
2467.07 Salaries depend on it.
2468.22 Sponsorships depend on it.
2469.55 It's on television,
2471.23 reputations depend on it.
2473.38 So that's not really playing a game.
2475.63 That's playing a very high stakes game
2477.58 and there you're not going to
see these partial postures.
2480.23 You're not going to see soft
eyes and tilting of the head.
2483.1 At least not between the
opposing players on the team,
2485.33 you're going to see quite the opposite.
2486.88 Grunting, screaming, shouldering
2488.99 people not blinking lowering their eyes,
2491.41 or rather shrinking their eyes down to be,
2494.45 to appear more aggressive.
2495.75 These kinds of things
2496.583 staring right through the other person,
2498.09 you know verbal threats et cetera.
2499.52 So that's not really play,
2501.13 even though we say they're
playing a game of football,
2503.31 it's very high stakes play.
2505.847 What I'm referring to here
2506.92 is when it's fairly low stakes.
2508.77 And we see this again
in animals and human.
2510.63 So there are many, many
of these partial postures.
2512.5 Again, they happen spontaneously.
2514.72 So if someone ever looks at you
2516.11 and they tilt their head a little bit
2517.33 and they raise their eyebrows
2518.56 and they maybe smile a little bit,
2519.94 they're looking at you playfully,
2521.62 that's the universal human
exchange of, I want to play.
2525.87 Do you want to play?
2527.07 There's another play expression
2528.81 that is considered the
most extreme of the come on
2531.7 let's play express and postures.
2534.03 And this is one that's
seen in a lot of primates
2535.9 and indeed in some humans as well.
2537.8 And that's the eyes wide open
2539.91 and believe it or not tongue out,
2541.73 it's the, that kind of silly thing.
2544.54 That's I don't think that
I've ever done that before.
2546.248 Just that kind of thing
2548.459 is basically what primate
species of all kinds.
2552.75 And indeed we are old
world primates as well,
2554.671 do when they want to say,
2557.35 I'm definitely here to play
2559.45 and that's why I'm here.
2560.94 Okay it's it has this kind
of silly look or connotation.
2563.93 But if you watch chimpanzees
or you look at Bonobos,
2567.77 or even in the so-called
new world monkeys,
2569.91 which tend to be the smaller monkeys,
2571.9 old world monkeys tend to
be the ones that in general,
2575.38 see the world as we do,
2576.72 they have what we call trichromacy.
2578.75 They're the ones that often
can look very human-like.
2580.85 The new world monkeys
tend to be the little ones
2582.511 in general I'll give
you a little trick here.
2584.68 Little tool based on primatology.
2587.03 If you see a monkey and it's
making very slow movements,
2590.01 or you see an ape of any kinds,
making very slow movements,
2592.17 very likely to be an old world primate.
2594.8 If you see a monkey
2597.5 and it's, it can very quick movements
2599.53 like it's doing this kind of thing,
2600.72 like it's like a could
be a squirrel monkey
2603.34 could be a marmoset,
2604.4 likely to be a new world monkey.
2606.04 And they don't see the world
that the same way we do,
2607.95 they see the world more like a dog.
2609.25 They don't really see reds.
2610.3 They see reds as orange et cetera.
2612.65 Okay that's not a hard and fast rule.
2614.08 And I'm sure the primatologists
are going to come after me
2616.81 with whatever primatologists
come after you
2618.67 with monkey biscuits
or something like that.
2620.24 But in general, it's a good rule.
2621.5 If you're at the zoo and
you see a slow moving monkey
2623.961 with slow deliberate gestures
kind of moves its eyes
2627.16 makes eye contact every once in a while,
2628.74 those tend to be the old world primates,
2630.09 those kind of jittery ones
2631.41 that look like they're really
nervous wrapping their tail
2633.1 and kind of hiding there
in a little bundle.
2634.81 Those tend to be the
new world monkeys, okay.
2637.31 Again, not a black and
white type division,
2640.57 but that'll get you most of the way.
2644.0 So the whole purpose of
these partial postures
2646.35 or the tongue out thing
2648.02 is to limit power in deliberate ways
2651.42 to really take bodily expressions
2653.27 that could be portrayed or could be
2657.468 interpreted as aggressive
2660.01 or as threatening or as wanting to mate,
2663.37 or as willing wanting to do
anything for that matter.
2665.8 And to limit the power with
which they are expressed
2669.23 in very deliberate way.
2670.33 So that's the putting the hair down,
2672.43 despite getting into a fighting stance.
2674.49 That's saying let's fight,
2675.55 but I'm not really here to fight fight.
2677.21 It's low stakes fighting.
2678.57 Like if I pin you,
2679.65 then I'll let you go.
2680.73 Or if you pin me, then
you ought let me go.
2682.85 And so immediately you can start to see
2685.09 how play starts to call into action,
2689.06 social dynamics in which both parties
2692.52 have to make some sort of agreement
2694.02 about how high the stakes are.
2696.34 Now, the failures to do this
are also very informative
2699.7 in how we develop in social groups.
2701.81 And this also can inform why some people
2704.24 really play well with others
and other people don't.
2706.37 And some people seem to
get along well with groups
2708.24 and can handle other people.
2709.073 And some people are very rigid.
2711.344 In fact, I have an anecdote
about this when I was a kid,
2714.3 we used to play this game.
2715.24 It's not a game I suggest,
2716.22 but we used to do what were
called "Dirt Clod Wars."
2718.78 So a friend of mine,
2719.99 his parents were generally
not home in the afternoon.
2722.358 So we must have been somewhere
around 10 or 11 years old.
2725.7 And we would set up these
two big dirt mounds.
2727.73 We would shovel them to big
dirt mounds on two sides
2729.74 of the yard.
2730.573 And then we would just take dirt clods
2732.67 and we throw them at one
another and just have
2734.41 dirt clod wars.
2735.243 Again, not suggesting this
2736.84 I'm not responsible for what happens
2738.78 if you do,
2739.69 but there were rules
2740.94 and the rules were, for instance,
2742.827 you couldn't pack rocks
into the dirt clods
2745.64 and you could run across to the other side
2749.16 and you could jump on
the other person's mound
2750.5 and you could throw dirt clods in there.
2751.69 I guess, as the stuff that
we thought was entertaining.
2754.84 But if someone got hit in the head,
2757.48 generally there was an unspoken rule
2759.75 that you kind of stop
2760.77 and see whether or not they were damaged
2762.35 or not before you'd continue,
2763.5 you couldn't continue pelting them.
2764.92 And of course, people broke this rule.
2766.28 In fact I remember one kid
2767.31 I'm not going to name him
2768.24 because actually he's grown
2769.72 into a very actually prominent
and functional adult,
2772.928 but he got hit once in the head.
2775.15 And then I think someone
had thrown a dirt clod
2777.07 shortly thereafter,
2777.938 and all of a sudden he
just went into a rage,
2781.07 picking up rocks and sticks
and attacking another kid.
2783.97 And so clearly that was a case in which
2786.63 the rules of the game
were now being violated,
2789.03 but it served a very important purpose.
2790.7 There was, you know,
2791.533 the typical thing that the,
2793.0 there were some tears I think,
2794.4 as I recall from one kid or the other,
2796.0 there was like snot coming out of the nose
2797.47 and turning bright red, a kid went home.
2799.63 It was a mess.
2800.463 The parents had to say something,
2801.92 or maybe there was a phone call.
2803.15 I don't quite recall how it got resolved.
2805.11 But the idea is that
2806.47 there's an agreed upon set of rules
2808.92 about how high the stakes are
2810.4 and what we're all going to do.
2811.65 And this is separate from sport
2812.79 where there are clearly defined rules
2814.55 about what's out of bounds.
2816.37 What's in-bounds.
2817.203 What sorts of behaviors
will get you a yellow card
2818.91 or a red card for instance
on the soccer field,
2820.97 all animals including humans
2823.05 are doing this low stakes
contingency testing
2825.91 and all animals including
humans you'll find,
2828.42 start to up the stakes.
2829.986 And inevitably in group play,
2832.7 one member of the group
will kind of break rules.
2835.35 You see this also in puppies.
2837.37 So for instance, puppies
will bite one another
2839.71 with those sharp little
needle-like puppy teeth.
2841.73 I remember when Costello had those teeth,
2843.04 those things were so darn sharp
2844.96 and puppies will yelp
2846.75 when one of their littermates bites them,
2848.98 that Yelp actually serves a very important
2851.7 inhibitory function.
2852.83 This is well defined
2853.9 to tell the other one that's too tough,
2855.63 and this is how animals learn soft bite.
2858.25 Okay.
2859.083 If they don't get that feedback
from other littermates,
2861.36 they never actually learn.
2862.45 What's too hard and what's soft.
2864.61 And so humans do this as well.
2866.67 Now you can look at your adult,
2868.28 counterparts,
2869.113 and indeed we should probably
look at ourselves and ask,
2870.964 you know did we learn
proper play contingency
2873.6 when we were younger?
2874.433 Do we tend to take things too seriously?
2875.88 Do we tend to overreact aggressively
2878.62 when other people are clearly engaging in,
2881.31 you know, playful, jabbing or sarcasm
2884.24 or things of that sort.
2885.29 So each of you will have a
different experience of this,
2887.03 but the point is that play
serves many functions,
2891.27 it's not just about the self.
2892.44 It's also about interactions
between multiple people.
2894.77 It's about rule testing
2895.99 and low stakes contingency
2897.16 rule breaking also
serves an important role
2899.34 as is with the example
of the "Dirt Clod War"
2902.13 puppies biting other puppies et cetera.
2904.49 And last but not least,
2906.2 there are different forms of play
2908.1 that help us establish who
we will become as adults.
2911.98 One of the more powerful of these
2913.46 is role play when children
and sometimes adults
2918.54 will take on different
roles that are distinct
2921.36 from their natural world roles
2923.55 in order to for instance,
establish hierarchies.
2926.65 So someone's going to be the leader
2927.92 and someone's going to be the follower.
2929.16 Someone will be dominant.
2930.1 Someone will be submissive.
2931.54 Someone will work alone.
2934.0 Other people will work in a group.
2935.68 These kinds of role playing
2937.39 are again ways in which
the prefrontal cortex
2940.19 has to expand the number of operations
2942.86 in neuroscience we call these algorithms
2944.72 that it has to run in
order to make predictions.
2946.53 You have to take in a lot of information
2948.1 about your environment all the time
2950.36 and make predictions.
2951.55 But if you are suddenly
cast into a new role,
2954.48 well then you definitely have to
2956.03 make even more predictions
from a different standpoint.
2959.22 So these are very powerful
for teaching the brain,
2961.44 how to function.
2962.61 I had a sister growing
up, I still have a sister,
2964.34 fortunately,
2965.27 and she and her friends
largely played with dolls
2968.64 and doll houses in the room next door.
2970.65 And they take on different roles.
2972.34 In fact, some kids,
2973.86 if they play alone
2975.1 will start to take on the role of leader
2977.57 by taking on an imaginary or
creating an imaginary friend.
2980.96 And, you know, my apologies to my sibling,
2983.05 but for a long time,
2984.36 she had an imaginary friend
2986.28 eventually that imaginary
friend disappeared.
2988.649 I don't know the science
around imaginary friends
2991.15 and what it makes them disappear or not
2993.03 at what stage of development,
2994.59 but imaginary friends are pretty common.
2996.34 And that's just another
way of being able to,
2998.286 you know boss somebody around,
3000.29 if that's your thing,
3001.21 or to do engage in cooperative play.
3003.6 So we can look at this
stage of development,
3006.26 we call childhood
3007.17 and we can look at each stage
of it and we can say, wow,
3009.92 there are all these
different dimensions of play
3011.82 that really are about testing out
3014.05 how we feel comfortable or uncomfortable,
3016.44 how we react good or bad,
3019.34 how we react with stress or with glee
3022.83 when others behave in certain ways.
3024.93 And so what I'm hoping is coming through
3027.19 is that play is not just about having fun.
3030.07 Play is about testing.
3032.29 It's about experimenting
3033.52 and it's about expanding
your brain's capacity.
3036.07 And that's through early in development,
3037.44 and it's through throughout the lifespan.
3039.946 So at this point in the discussion,
3040.779 I want to take a step back,
3041.827 look at the biology and
neurochemistry of play
3044.81 just a little bit.
3046.21 And that really define
what is effective play.
3049.76 If the goal of play is to
explore different contingencies
3052.546 in low stakes environments
3054.296 and to expand the function
of our prefrontal cortex
3057.87 so that we can see new possibilities
3059.69 and new ways of being become
more flexible, more creative,
3062.8 more effective outside
of the games of play
3066.205 or the arenas of play, I should say.
3068.89 Well then we should be asking,
3071.37 how do I know if I'm playing?
3072.64 How do I know if I'm playing correctly?
3074.878 Turns out there's an answer to that.
3076.837 Earlier I referred to this brain area,
3079.47 the periaqueductal gray
that releases opioids,
3083.12 endogenous opioids into
our brain and body,
3086.09 and tends to relax us a bit.
3089.41 It actually is what leads to
these things like soft eyes
3092.41 and head tilts and
puppies making, you know,
3095.315 puppy postures and things of that sort,
3097.47 and how that opens up the
number of different functions
3101.29 or algorithms that the
prefrontal cortex can run,
3104.44 but there's another piece of the puzzle,
3105.91 which is for something to
genuinely be play and playful,
3110.29 and for it to have this
effect of expanding our brain
3114.66 and engaging neuroplasticity
of really changing our brain
3117.61 so that we can see and engaging
more possible behaviors
3120.61 and thoughts et cetera.
3122.15 We also have to have low
amounts of adrenaline,
3125.917 so called epinephrine
in our brain in body.
3128.949 Now the background science
for this is quite extensive,
3132.73 but for those of you that
are interested in papers
3135.21 and manuscripts,
3136.17 perhaps the best one is a review published
3138.51 in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews
3140.86 by the very Jaak Panksepp
3142.5 although he has a co-author,
3143.81 which is Stephen Siviy,
3145.39 S I V I Y
3147.61 I'll provide a link to this
in the caption show notes.
3150.46 And the title of this paper is;
3152.047 "In Search of the
Neurobiological Substrates for
3154.3 Social Playfulness in Mammalian Brains."
3157.2 And it's a quite extensive review,
3159.07 but it basically boils down
3160.3 to some key findings
3162.5 whereby, any sorts of drugs
or behaviors or scenarios
3167.81 that increase levels
of adrenaline too much,
3171.67 will tend to inhibit play
3173.87 and drugs and scenarios
and I'm not suggesting
3178.233 recreational drugs here,
3179.066 but these were experiments that were done
3180.0 in the laboratory setting
3181.69 that increase the endogenous opioid output
3185.16 will tend to increase playfulness.
3187.21 And so really the state of mind
3189.92 that one needs to adopt when playing is,
3193.58 first of all you have to
engage in the play it,
3196.26 whatever it happens to be
with some degree of focus
3199.45 and seriousness
3200.64 and focus and seriousness in
the neurobiological context
3203.37 generally means epinephrine
3204.808 being able to focus is largely reliant on
3208.41 things like adrenaline epinephrine,
3210.21 but also the presence of dopamine,
3212.11 which is a molecule that
generates motivation
3214.32 and focus in concert with epinephrine,
3216.82 but also that these endogenous
opioids be liberated.
3220.26 And it's really the low
stakes feature of play
3222.83 that allows those endogenous
opioids to be liberated.
3225.72 What do I mean by that?
3226.56 Well, if you are very, very
concerned about the outcome,
3229.27 like you've put a lot of money
on the table in a given game,
3232.286 or you're a football
player in the Super Bowl,
3235.856 or you're playing a game for which,
3237.87 you know, defeating the other person
3239.626 or your team winning is
absolutely crucial to you.
3243.3 Well then that's not
really going to who engage
3245.55 the play circuitry.
3246.926 On the contrary,
3249.35 if you are engaging in
those same behaviors
3251.6 or any other behavior in a way
3252.87 that you're simply there to explore,
3255.14 but you don't have high levels
of adrenaline in your system,
3257.33 you're not stressed about
the potential outcome.
3259.332 Well, then that constitutes play.
3261.676 Now that's somewhat
obvious on the one hand
3264.55 that you take seriously
what you take seriously,
3266.3 and you can be more playful about things
3267.59 that you don't take so seriously,
3269.25 but what is absolutely not obvious
3272.63 is that the state of playfulness
3275.8 is actually what allows
you to perform best
3278.946 because the state of playfulness
3281.13 offers you the opportunity to engage
3283.26 in novel types of
behaviors and interactions
3285.052 that you would not
otherwise be able to access
3288.3 if you are so focused
on the outcome. Okay.
3291.33 So a state of playfulness
is absolutely critical,
3293.94 not just during play,
3295.56 but during competitive
scenarios of any kind.
3298.3 I actually started to cultivate
a practice related to this.
3301.92 When I was in college,
3303.23 I had this kind of general practice
3306.03 of when I wanted to learn something.
3307.466 I would tell myself that
it was the most important
3311.38 information in the world
3312.45 and that I was very very interested in it.
3314.59 I would kind of lie to myself
3315.93 and say oh, I'm super interested in,
3317.61 I won't name the topics,
3318.69 but super interested in this
or super interested in that.
3320.99 And I could sort of delude
myself into being hyper focused
3324.07 on whatever it is
3324.959 that I was learning
3326.74 in ways that surprised me.
3328.595 However,
3330.21 when we are hyper focused on something
3333.28 and we are rigidly
attached to the outcome,
3335.99 we can't engage in flexible thinking.
3338.45 So it's a great tool to be
hyper-focused on something
3341.37 and take it very, very seriously
3344.665 when we're simply trying to learn things
3345.95 by kind of rote memory,
3347.04 learn things and regurgitate,
3348.22 learn and regurgitate of the sort that,
3349.627 you know, I'm frankly a
lot of schooling involves.
3352.345 But if we are trying to
get better at something,
3355.45 we sort of hit a wall
in athletic performance
3357.102 or in cognitive performance,
3358.96 where we're not creative enough,
3360.28 where we're finding
3361.36 let's just use a sports example
3362.77 that, you know we only have
a certain number of moves
3365.66 that we can deploy
3366.82 or certain number of swings of the racket
3368.41 that we can deploy.
3369.6 The way to actually expand your practice
3372.32 is to engage in this kind
of low stakes thinking,
3374.858 the idea that, well, I'm just
going to kind of play and tinker.
3378.23 I'm going to explore in a way
3379.73 that it doesn't really matter
if the ball goes back over
3381.67 the net,
3382.503 doesn't really matter if
the ball goes in the hole
3383.97 and it's counterintuitive
because you think,
3385.94 no, the thing that we need
to do is drill and drill
3388.29 and drill and drill.
3389.123 And indeed there's a place for that.
3390.143 But this mode of play with modest levels
3394.78 of endogenous opioids being
released in our system,
3397.23 plus low levels of adrenaline, right?
3399.75 Epinephrine low levels of
epinephrine and adrenaline
3401.939 are possible only when
the stakes are low enough
3405.52 that we're not stressed.
3407.21 Well that combination really
allows the prefrontal cortex
3410.2 to explore different possibilities
3412.19 in ways that can truly expand
our capabilities over time.
3415.98 Now, this has been seen again and again,
3417.47 also in the business sector,
3419.119 some of the more challenging,
3422.33 or I should say compare additive
companies to get jobs at
3424.84 are very interested in hiring people
3426.63 that as children were so called tinkerers,
3429.04 and actually NASA was
first famous for this,
3432.09 that many of the people
that achieved great success
3435.2 in engineering at NASA,
3436.467 when they looked back into
their childhood histories,
3440.0 those people tended to be tinkerers.
3441.57 They were people that would
kind of play with things
3443.38 in way that wasn't about
rigidly following a recipe
3446.85 or an instruction manual.
3448.15 Great cooks discover new forms of food.
3451.088 Indeed created entire genres of food
3454.046 by way of being tinkerers.
3456.6 Okay, musicians do this.
3458.287 I grew up playing various sports,
3460.85 but skateboarding was one that
I was particularly involved
3463.27 in for a long time.
3464.27 One of the greatest
skateboarders of all time
3465.96 is some of you may recognize his name
3468.12 as the Great Rodney Mullen.
3469.68 And Rodney was kind of
famous for evolving the sport
3474.17 and continuing to evolve the sport in ways
3475.53 that no one could predict
3476.6 using skateboards and all sorts of ways
3478.55 that no one had thought of previously.
3480.29 And of course there
are other skateboarders
3481.5 that did that as well,
3482.64 but he's particularly well known for that.
3484.239 And his process is his own.
3486.82 I can't speak to it too much,
3487.967 but he was also known
as a kind of a tinker
3490.74 as somebody who would spend a lot of time,
3492.59 just kind of flipping the board
3493.99 and just flipping it into the air
3495.67 and watching the ways in which it flipped
3497.25 and kind of studying
the physics of it really
3499.92 and expanding on his
existing understanding
3502.84 of what could happen on a skateboard
3504.8 by way of just playing.
3506.21 Now, he took it very seriously,
3507.99 but it's this kind of razor's edge
3510.12 between taking something very seriously,
3511.77 but also tinkering and
playing and exploring
3514.21 and just seeing what
happens and kind of like,
3516.03 well, let's just see what
happens if we did this,
3517.716 that mindset is extremely powerful
3520.79 to export from this
thing that we call play
3523.39 into what we could call
more serious endeavor
3525.78 of one's occupation or sport,
3527.84 whether or not it's behind a desk
3529.14 or whether or not it's
running around on a field
3531.14 really for or engineering, any endeavor.
3533.73 And so the whole purpose
of this episode on play
3537.81 is yes on the one hand
3539.46 to illustrate the incredible
evolutionary utility of play
3543.55 for setting up the self
3545.39 and relation of the self to others,
3546.87 indeed for setting up cultures entirely,
3548.81 cuz' cultures will watch sport together
3550.89 or they'll celebrate their team winning.
3552.64 I mean, World Cup,
3553.48 I've never been a big soccer fan,
3554.96 even though my dad is
Argentine, but it's incredible.
3558.14 I mean the entire world kind of lights up
3560.5 and gets engaged around
whether or not their team,
3562.67 their country is going
to win the Olympics also
3564.52 being another example,
3565.83 but play and sport are not quite the same
3568.68 as I've pointed out before.
3570.0 And for all of us who
are thinking about tools
3572.04 and things that we can
extract from science
3573.64 to enrich our lives,
3575.36 I would say for those of
you that are already playing
3577.66 on a regular basis
3578.99 in one form or another
3579.96 terrific start to expand
other forms of play
3583.04 in particular forms of play
3584.23 that involve new groups of individuals.
3587.1 So if you're somebody that typically plays
3588.93 one-on-one with somebody,
3590.05 try to expand into playing as teams.
3592.06 If you're somebody who only plays alone,
3594.278 then try to expand into playing in perhaps
3597.89 one-on-one first and in groups,
3599.28 this is the way that your brain learns
3601.05 and evolves and changes and gets better.
3603.32 And I raised this because
3604.48 another one of the top 10 questions I get
3606.53 is how can I keep my brain young?
3608.46 How can I continue to learn?
3610.02 How can I get better in school
3612.64 and sport in life and
relationships, et cetera,
3614.78 emotionally, cognitively,
3616.668 and on and on and on.
3618.35 And yes,
3619.51 there are supplements that
can support neuroplasticity.
3622.01 Yes, there are brain games and apps
3624.02 that can support neuroplasticity.
3625.83 But if you really want to engage
neuroplasticity at any age,
3629.468 what you need to do is
return to the same sorts
3631.9 of practices and tools
3633.61 that your nervous system naturally used
3636.39 throughout development.
3637.33 And it evolved over hundreds
of thousands of years
3639.89 to trigger this thing that
we call neuroplasticity.
3642.205 And the reason this is
so important is because
3644.29 it starts to move us away from
what some people call hacks.
3646.85 I define hacks as using one
thing for a different purpose
3649.71 to kind of get a shortcut.
3651.65 I don't really like the term, frankly,
3653.61 and I don't like it
because it's not grounded
3657.22 in any biological mechanism.
3658.708 But when we look at play,
3660.3 we can say, play is the portal to plastic.
3663.26 Play at every stage of life
3664.87 is the way in which we learned the rules
3666.7 for that stage of life.
3668.38 And play is the way in
which we were able to test
3671.3 how we might function in
the real world context.
3674.76 So play is powerful.
3677.6 And we could even say that play
is the most powerful portal
3680.58 to plasticity.
3681.51 The reason for that is that
3682.987 yes, this high opioid, low
epinephrine or adrenaline state
3689.29 is what opens up play.
3690.728 But then inside of the arena of play,
3693.94 when the prefrontal cortex is running
3695.42 all these different possibilities
in this low stakes way.
3699.01 But with some degree of focus,
3700.579 there are a number of other
chemicals that are deployed.
3704.0 Things like Brain-derived
neurotrophic factor
3706.11 and other growth factors that actually
3707.89 trigger the rewiring of brain circuits
3710.69 that allow for it to expand.
3712.75 And indeed that's what is neuroplasticity.
3715.56 If you're interested in those chemicals
3718.03 and kind of arena of things that happen
3721.14 when one engages in neuroplasticity,
3723.12 there's a vast literature out there.
3725.07 But one of the more popular books
3727.23 that I think is quite good
3728.16 is from my friend and
colleague, John Ratey,
3730.34 who's a psychiatrist at
Harvard Medical School.
3732.3 That's R A T E Y.
3733.91 He wrote the book "Spark"
3735.27 a few years back,
3737.05 and I think it's still very relevant.
3738.54 And John talks about
3741.05 the important role that play
3742.946 exerts in the neuroplasticity process
3745.7 and points to a number
of different protocols
3747.37 that one can engage in.
3748.62 He also points to the
importance of navigating
3751.02 new environments
3751.853 to not just go on the
same hike every week,
3753.73 or take the same walk,
3754.67 but actually get into
new novel environments.
3756.87 So you're starting to sense a theme here.
3758.18 There's novelty,
3759.088 exploring contingencies,
3761.02 keeping the stakes relatively low,
3762.91 et cetera, et cetera.
3764.17 But these really are the gates
3765.79 to this holy grail that
we call neuroplasticity.
3768.6 Neuroplasticity as I've talked
about in the podcast before
3771.41 is a two step process.
3772.68 It involves focusing very intensely
3775.4 or at least focusing
somewhat on whatever it is
3777.9 that one is trying to learn,
3779.04 and then engaging in deep rest,
3781.64 ideally deep sleep in
the following nights.
3783.98 And I've also talked about
the benefits of things
3785.9 like naps and Yoga Nidra so-called NSDR,
3788.45 Non Sleep Deep Rest
3789.88 for enhancing or accelerating plasticity.
3792.58 You can check out the episodes
on Focus at hubermanlab.com
3796.95 or the episodes on How to Learn Faster.
3799.29 The detail all of those.
3800.21 We had a newsletter that lists out
3802.73 all the tools for neuroplasticity
enhancing neuroplasticity,
3806.21 all that is available.
3807.24 Zero cost to you at
hubermalab.com, et cetera.
3810.71 You can just download that information,
3813.17 but John's book that
newsletter those episodes.
3816.56 They really point to this two step process
3818.27 where it's focus and then rest
3819.158 focus and then rest
3821.49 and play is its own unique form
3824.23 of focus and then rest, focus and rest.
3826.99 It's not the same as learning
something for sake of school
3830.03 or critically trying to
learn a motor behavior
3832.67 for sake of sport.
3833.92 It's really about expanding
the number of things
3836.56 that you could learn down the line.
3839.46 Okay, so said once again.
3841.35 So I just want to make
sure it's abundantly clear
3843.92 play is about establishing
a broader framework
3847.03 within which you can learn new things.
3848.99 It's not about learning
some specific thing.
3851.36 It's not about the game
you happen to be playing.
3853.96 It's not about the dollhouse
that the kids are playing with
3856.64 so that they can become
amazing dollhouse players
3858.95 when they grow up. Right.
3860.21 The dirt Clod war that
I referred to earlier
3862.292 for better or for worse
3864.04 was not about becoming
the best dirt clod thrower
3866.252 or winning the trophy for dirt clods
3868.78 in the neighborhood.
3869.613 Although we actually had a trophy
3870.61 for the best dirt clod team.
3871.822 Alas, it was not my team that year.
3874.481 But the point is that
you're learning rules
3877.73 and establishing a broader
foundation of practices
3881.12 that then can learn more
things within that context.
3884.83 Thus far I've tried to convince you
3886.34 through a combination of data
and anecdote and explanation
3889.7 that adopting a stance of playfulness
3892.77 and indeed engaging in play
3894.41 on a somewhat regular basis
3896.07 could be beneficial to you
3897.17 regardless of circumstances or goals.
3899.675 If I haven't done that already,
3902.21 what I'm about to tell you,
3903.22 hopefully will push you over the line.
3905.72 It turns out that when you
look across the kingdom
3909.55 of all animals,
3911.27 what you find is that animals
3914.41 that engage in playful behaviors
3916.64 for the longest period of time
3919.05 are also the animals that
have the greatest degree
3922.04 of neuroplasticity,
3923.652 the brain and nervous system's ability
3925.84 to change in response to experience,
3928.75 put differently,
3929.81 animals that only play
for a very small fraction
3932.81 of their entire life
3934.38 have very rigid brains that
don't learn new things,
3937.85 whereas animals that
play for a long period
3941.28 throughout their life
3942.48 have very plastic brains.
3944.92 And there's even some
evidence that's at this point,
3947.99 largely anecdotal,
3948.97 but there's some data starting to emerge
3951.2 that adults that maintain a playful stance
3954.55 that engage in things again
3956.1 that are low stakes contingency exploring
3962.28 important enough that people focus
3964.99 and that people pay attention
to what they're doing,
3966.81 but that they are not, you know,
3968.55 filled with adrenaline, you know,
3969.97 freaked out about the
outcome being A or B,
3972.71 they're not super, super competitive,
3974.3 maybe just a little bit competitive
3975.7 or not competitive at all.
3977.47 That allows for more ongoing plasticity.
3980.84 And one of the people that comes to mind
3983.28 in thinking about this is
of course the Physicist,
3985.85 and I should say the Great
Physicist, Richard Feynman,
3988.85 Nobel Prize Winner Professor at Caltech
3990.822 was involved in the Manhattan Project,
3993.43 but was also known for being
a lifelong tinker, right?
3998.19 He also is a mischievous tinker.
4000.87 If you read any of the books
about Feynman or by Feynman
4003.877 "Surely You're Joking."
4004.71 Mr. Feynman, or "What Do You
Care What Other People Think?"
4007.1 these are wonderful short stories,
4008.34 mostly about Feynman,
4009.8 doing things like
4010.982 picking all the locks at
the Los Alamos Laboratory
4014.94 and putting all the top secret documents
4016.57 out on the floor of the office
4017.91 so that when people
came men in the morning,
4019.22 they were all out there.
4020.183 Obviously they weren't
released to the general public.
4023.17 He didn't want to threaten
national security,
4025.11 but playing pranks like that.
4026.95 And actually Caltech,
4028.62 I don't know if this is still the case,
4029.85 but Caltech where he was employed
4031.2 was always known for doing very
4033.1 technologically challenging pranks.
4036.86 They're not known for their
athletic pros at Caltech,
4039.34 sorry, Caltech,
4040.51 but they were known for example,
4042.721 disrupting the scoreboard at
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,
4046.77 for instance,
4047.603 and things of that sort
4048.45 through technological
feats, at least at the time
4051.24 required a lot of playfulness
4053.6 and technological pros.
4055.26 So if you look in science
or you look in art,
4057.89 or you look in medicine
or you in any domain,
4060.3 what you find is the people
that continue to evolve
4063.31 new practices
4064.414 tend to be people that were tinkerers.
4066.212 People that are very creative,
4068.72 tend to be people that are unafraid
4071.24 of exploring things in
a, this low stakes way.
4074.11 They're not so rigidly
attached to the outcome
4076.35 that they have to do everything
perfectly all the time.
4078.5 Now they might cloak
these playful behaviors
4081.17 so that their final works
4082.7 always look perfect or
always look incredible,
4085.1 but they have this kind of
playful nature about them.
4087.0 I would venture even say that the,
4088.71 the street artist Banksy, for instance,
4090.94 obviously an incredible
artist puts a ton of thought
4093.08 and preparation into their work,
4095.732 but there's a kind of playfulness
to the whole thing too,
4099.92 of using two dimensional paintings
4102.37 in concert with three
dimensional city dwellings
4104.3 in ways that,
4105.133 you know I think that most
people hadn't previously,
4106.96 there were other people
like Christo and, you know,
4108.82 artists of that sort that did that.
4110.41 But I think Banksy is kind of recognized
4112.85 as the modern, the modern rendition
4115.6 of that kind of playfulness
using cities in ways
4118.01 that most people don't use cities
4119.19 using art in ways that
most people don't use art,
4122.53 for instance.
4123.76 So to go back to the example of Feynman.
4126.04 Feynman was somebody who learned to paint
4128.88 and draw quite well into his sixties.
4130.723 He was somewhat famous or infamous,
4133.26 I should say for Bongo Drumming
on the roof of Caltech.
4136.3 I say infamous because
4137.95 he was known also for doing that naked.
4140.49 Something that certainly not in concert
4142.58 with the ethical standards and behaviors
4144.74 of universities today.
4145.99 But Feynman had this
playful spirit as a child.
4150.24 He had that playful spirit as a teenager,
4151.9 and he had that playful
spirit as an adult.
4154.43 And that's one of the
whole hallmarks of Feynman
4156.85 was that he wasn't just a rigid physicist
4160.04 who could explain things
clearly to the general public.
4162.3 He always carried through
this playful spirit
4165.9 and in some of his writings,
4167.3 he pointed to the fact
that that playful spirit
4169.21 was something that he worked very hard
4171.12 to continue to cultivate in himself
4174.36 because it was the way
in which he could see
4176.34 the world differently
4177.55 and to indeed make great discoveries
4179.9 in the field of physics,
4180.96 but also to kind of
evolve his relationship
4183.28 to life more generally.
4184.23 And so he comes to mind
4185.324 as a prominent example
of somebody who did this.
4188.275 And if I could achieve
anything with this episode,
4190.876 besides teaching you something
about the biology of play,
4193.21 it would be to teach you
about the utility of play.
4196.254 Again, I'm,
4197.37 don't consider myself a
particularly playful person
4200.0 by nature,
4200.9 but I've tried over the years to adopt
4203.11 this stance of exploring
things that are, you know,
4206.58 very focused on contingencies
of different kinds,
4209.27 but keep the stakes low enough
4210.77 that I can have some fun doing them.
4212.31 And I like to think that
it's benefited me somewhat.
4215.0 Now, I'd like to drill
a little bit further
4216.43 into this thing that we
called neuroplasticity.
4218.45 Again neuroplasticity is the
brain and nervous system's
4221.99 ability to change in
response to experience.
4224.38 And I should just say that
throughout the entire lifespan,
4227.44 the nervous system can change very quickly
4229.5 in response to negative experiences.
4231.94 We can almost all engage in
what's called one trial learning
4234.82 where if something really
terrible or traumatic happens
4237.24 to us,
4238.073 our nervous system will
rewire almost immediately,
4240.92 at least within a few days,
4242.51 such that we tend to want
to avoid the experience
4245.21 that led to that trauma.
4247.6 Now the whole business of
why people return to things
4250.46 that are traumatic to them
4251.64 is a whole other issue.
4252.51 There are books about
things like trauma bonding.
4255.63 There's the so-called
repetition compulsion
4258.42 from psychoanalysis
4259.49 that people go back into trauma to retest
4261.66 and gain new opportunities
to overcome the trauma,
4264.22 et cetera, et cetera.
4265.053 But in general, what I'm
referring to here is,
4267.0 you know,
4267.833 you have a bad experience
at the swimming pool
4269.19 when you're a kid
4270.023 where someone holds your
head underwater too long,
4271.057 and then you just don't want
to get back in the water.
4273.04 That's one trial learning of sorts,
4275.101 that of course can be overcomed
4277.354 through proper exposure therapy
4279.56 or someone that you
trust taking you there,
4281.68 or any number of behaviors
4283.72 that allow you to overcome that,
4285.22 be that particular scenario
and experience something new
4287.89 in that same context.
4289.94 But across the lifespan,
4292.17 the learn earning of new
things, new contingencies,
4294.64 new possibilities
4296.152 occurs very differently
4297.97 from about age zero when we're born
4300.49 until about age 25 and thereafter.
4303.03 So from about, about,
4304.85 I want to emphasize
approximately age 25 onward
4307.672 neuroplasticity occurs through the process
4310.72 that is exactly as I
described before, focus, rest,
4314.17 focus, rest, we focus very intensely.
4316.81 We can't do the thing.
4317.84 We can't do the new movement.
4319.01 We can't do the golf swing.
4320.22 We can't learn the math.
4321.514 We try, we try, we try, we
try, we sleep a few nights.
4324.75 And then all of a sudden
we can do it, right,
4325.973 because the rewiring actually
occurs during deep rest
4328.6 or naps,
4329.52 but mostly during deep sleep.
4332.43 From birth till about out age 25 however,
4335.32 we can learn things, new things,
4337.67 and new contingencies,
4339.8 not just negative things
4341.25 and traumatic things
4342.293 through somewhat passive
exposure to those things, right.
4345.51 I will never forget the first time
4347.51 that we went on a family
trip to Washington DC.
4350.94 And we went to the Smithsonian.
4352.16 I got to see the, the old fighter planes.
4354.07 And I think,
4354.903 I think the Kitty Hawk
4356.52 or the first one of the
first planes was there.
4358.43 Anyway, I obviously my
recollection isn't terrific.
4360.73 My hippocampus is, is
flailing on that one,
4363.54 but I'll never forget the trip.
4364.81 And I'll never forget who went.
4366.01 And I think I was probably
eight or nine years old.
4368.061 It's embedded somewhere in my memory.
4370.57 And so just through passive experience
4373.06 and my focusing on the
things that excited me
4374.931 about that trip,
4376.55 I have a recollection of that experience.
4378.26 I didn't have to deliberately focus.
4380.41 I didn't, wasn't telling myself focused,
4381.98 you're going to need to
remember this trip someday
4383.59 and you're going to be
podcasting about this,
4385.1 you know, in 39 years, or whenever
4387.95 again, I forget exactly how old I was.
4389.62 But the key feature here is that
4392.61 the developing brain is able
4394.91 to learn through passive experience
4397.82 because the neurons, the nerve
cells in the developing brain
4401.553 are much more over-connected
4405.78 than they will be later in life.
4407.77 The way to think about this is sort of,
4409.01 if you use Google maps,
4410.22 as I do too often I think
4413.54 when I drive,
4414.83 there are a number of roads and pathways
4416.54 that would get you from
point A to point B.
4418.44 We could imagine those as neural circuits,
4421.54 or we could imagine neural
circuits as those roads.
4424.503 Early in development,
the nerve connections
4428.16 are much more extensive.
4429.78 It it's like having a Google maps
4432.05 that where everything is
connected to everything
4433.99 through tiny little cross streets.
4435.27 And the whole thing is
just a complete mess.
4437.58 But then by taking particular routes
4439.58 of behavior of thought of emotion,
4442.98 certain routes become well established.
4446.25 And the other routes that are not taken
4448.274 simply disappear.
4450.29 Now in the biological
context in the brain,
4452.71 we call that process pruning.
4454.8 And the simple way to envision
this is early in development.
4457.41 You have many, many more
neurons than you will have
4460.41 as an adult.
4461.46 Those neurons are
extensively interconnected,
4463.811 and approximately 40% of
those interconnections
4467.5 will disappear by the
time you're 25 years old,
4470.06 they are gone.
4471.24 They are actively
removed through processes
4473.9 that involve things like
glial cells that come in
4476.55 and literally sneak their little processes
4479.13 in between neurons at the synapse,
4481.32 which are the points of
contact and communication
4483.09 between neurons and push those apart,
4485.03 even eat neurons, right?
4487.33 There's some incredible
work from for instance,
4490.25 Beth Stevens' Lab at
Harvard Medical School,
4492.42 showing that glial cells
go in and eat synapses
4496.72 that are not functional for
that particular circuit.
4500.38 Now, what this tells us is
that much of our learning
4503.85 during development is the
removal of incorrect connections,
4507.21 but it also involves the
strengthening of connections
4509.88 that are going to serve certain
emotions, certain functions,
4513.67 motor functions, cognitive
functions, et cetera.
4517.77 The process of play
4520.3 is largely a process of engaging pruning
4523.64 of neural connections
4524.95 and strengthening of the
remaining connections.
4528.02 I'm sure that many of
you have heard the term
4529.55 fire together wire together.
4531.282 That phrase is often
incorrectly attributed
4535.46 to the great Donald Hebb,
who indeed was great.
4537.79 Did incredible work a
psychologist from Canada
4540.1 who established a lot of the
basic cellar learning rules
4542.81 for learning and memory,
4544.38 but it was the also great Dr. Carla Shatz,
4548.21 who is now at Stanford
4549.77 and was at Berkeley and Harvard as well,
4552.64 but who is at Stanford Medical School
4554.91 who coined this term fire
together wire together.
4557.21 Indeed that's what happens
4559.02 when children play
4560.531 when adolescents play
4562.78 and when young adults play,
4564.67 whether or not it's social play
4566.308 or play with an object,
4567.94 whether or not it's a
sport or a play of any kind
4570.84 imaginary play imaginary friend play,
4574.12 there is a strengthening of
certain neural connections
4576.5 and a pruning away of up to 40%,
4579.27 perhaps even more of connections
4581.098 that are not necessary for
certain types of behaviors,
4586.46 emotions, and thoughts.
4588.2 And what this means is
4589.63 that it is through the process of play,
4592.36 that we become who we are as adults.
4594.75 And as I mentioned earlier,
4595.86 it is through the process of play
4597.921 that we are able to adjust
who we are as adults.
4601.64 Now, there are bounds on this process,
4604.071 as far as I know there's
never been a reported case
4607.47 of an individual who had a hyperplastic
4610.12 or I should say a brain that
was as plastic in adulthood
4615.54 as it was in childhood.
4617.55 But what this tells us is that
4619.85 what we do in the process
of play as children
4623.56 is really how we set up the rules
4625.04 for how we behave as adults
in almost all domains,
4628.15 which is really incredible.
4629.49 And of course the reassuring thing is that
4631.26 playing as an adult
4632.57 will allow you to expand
on those neural circuits.
4635.09 You can literally grow new connections.
4637.0 Some of you may be saying,
4637.88 does it create new neurons
4639.158 for better or for worse?
4641.4 It does not seem that
many new neurons are added
4644.92 to your brain in adulthood.
4646.31 There are some papers
that report a few neurons
4648.97 in certain brain areas,
isolated brain areas,
4651.57 but by and large,
4652.403 most of the rewiring of neural connections
4654.1 is the removal of certain connections.
4656.02 This process we're calling Pruning
4657.68 and the strengthening of
the remaining connections
4660.5 that make those kind of Google maps roads.
4662.34 And the analogy I laid out before
4663.86 thicker and more robust think about as
4665.97 taking little trails
4667.18 and turning them into roads,
then paving those roads.
4670.43 Then turning those roads into highways,
4672.0 then putting up more
lanes on those highways
4674.72 and eliminating all the small
little back-country roads
4677.32 that one could take.
4678.68 And again,
4679.513 this is an analogy for what is happening
4681.19 at the level of neuro circuitry.
4683.02 Now,
4683.853 one of the key findings that
has emerged from the literature
4688.23 is children that have
been subjected to trauma
4693.28 or immense amounts of stress of any kind,
4696.566 have a harder time both engaging in play,
4699.71 but also a harder time
accessing neuroplasticity later
4702.62 in life.
4703.72 The good news is this is
not a permanent effect.
4706.28 And we'll talk about some
of the ways to overcome that
4708.276 in a moment,
4709.58 but this should make sense to you
4712.1 because earlier we talked about
4714.24 how a high level of adrenaline
4717.14 epinephrine in the brain and body
4718.82 actually inhibits blocks the circuits
4722.03 in the brain and body that
generate play behavior.
4725.4 And when I say that,
4726.233 I mean that in a very concrete way,
4727.93 that epinephrine and adrenaline
4730.0 can actually suppress
the sorts of circuitry
4732.69 that can lead to things like soft eyes
4734.92 or tongue out, or the head tilt,
4737.87 or what we called partial postures
4740.49 of being able to engage in,
4742.202 you know, a rough and tumble play,
4744.51 but not take that to the
point of outright aggression
4746.89 and damaging the other
person or them damaging you.
4750.23 So when I say that,
4751.92 you know, trauma and stress
can inhibit neuroplasticity
4755.43 by way of inhibiting play
4757.271 at a deeper neuro biological level.
4759.58 What I'm really saying is
4760.8 that the high levels of adrenaline
4762.55 that are generated from
trauma and stress actually
4765.06 shut down the circuits
4766.68 that allow a child or a young adult
4769.63 to enter the game of play
4770.92 or in the game of play
4772.6 in the same way that
a child or young adult
4775.41 who didn't have high levels of adrenaline
4777.74 in their system could possibly engage in.
4781.04 Now,
4781.873 the good news is that many of
the existing trauma therapies
4784.79 that are out there now,
4785.623 including things like EMDR
4786.99 Exposure Therapy, Cognitive
Behavioral therapy,
4789.59 and on and on,
4790.61 including some of the therapies
4793.85 that are more neurochemical,
4795.22 things like ketamine, or
are more engineering based,
4798.473 things like Transcranial magnetic
stimulation for instance,
4802.15 many of those are paired
with forms of talk therapy
4805.58 that are really about the
same thing that play is about,
4808.42 which is exploring
different contingencies.
4810.292 It's about exploring different types
4813.52 of emotional experiences
4815.59 as they relate to the
same sort of scenario
4818.16 that created the trauma.
4819.4 And we did an entire
episode on fear and trauma,
4821.94 and I recommend you
check out that episode.
4823.77 It's easy to find again
at hubermanlab.com,
4825.92 it's on YouTube, Apples,
Spotify, et cetera, et cetera,
4828.11 very easy to find.
4829.01 And there I talk all
about trauma treatments
4831.082 and the various kinds of trauma treatments
4833.29 that are out there,
4834.123 their efficacy in different
scenarios and traumas and so on.
4838.0 But the point I'd like to make now is that
4840.05 the reason why children who
experience a lot of trauma
4842.76 and stress have limited
plasticity later on
4845.882 is because the neurochemical substrates
4848.96 that are created from trauma and stress,
4851.42 because after all
4852.253 stress is epinephrine and
epinephrine is stress.
4854.92 Those are inseparable
4856.67 and the way in which it
more or less shuts down
4859.42 or at least inhibits suppresses
4862.342 those play circuits.
4864.485 And again the reassuring thing
4865.719 is that by engaging in play as adults,
4867.46 we can reactivate some of those circuits
4869.46 and reopen the plasticity.
4871.18 In fact one very prominent
trauma treatment now,
4874.72 especially for people
that have been subjected
4877.25 to very severe traumas,
4878.679 in the ongoing sense,
4880.41 meaning traumas that went
on for many, many years
4883.25 is to get them to engage in play
4886.04 in things like dance
4887.57 in basically getting them to engage
4889.84 their bodily movements
4890.86 in ways that they would otherwise
4892.65 not feel comfortable to engage in.
4894.52 And I find this area so interesting
4896.68 because on the face of it, you could say,
4898.52 oh, that's kind of, you know,
4899.47 is that really biomedical treatment?
4900.95 You know, you're taking
people who traumatized
4902.32 and having them dance.
4903.45 I mean, it seems kind of
silly on the one hand,
4905.48 depending on your, you know,
4907.168 your particular orientation.
4910.98 But on the other hand,
4912.32 it's actually quite
profound and quite grounded
4916.23 in the mechanisms by which
the brain circuits change.
4919.44 So again,
4921.05 back to this original principle,
4922.37 which is that play, isn't
just one portal to plasticity
4925.69 play is the fundamental
portal to plasticity
4928.86 and that play and dance
4930.22 and exploration of novel movements,
4932.14 exploration of novel athletic movements
4934.496 are the route
4936.43 by which we access new ways of thinking
4939.28 new contingencies.
4940.597 And I find it wonderful
that the trauma release
4944.2 and the psychiatric and
psychology community
4947.12 are exploring things like play and dance
4950.97 and other forms of
reopening these circuits
4954.3 because indeed we would all love
4956.776 for there to be a magic pill
4958.9 by which trauma could be erased
4960.32 and new memories could be laid down
4961.91 or a device that could do that.
4963.57 But frankly, if you ask me
or a number of my colleagues,
4966.8 whether or not that's likely
to happen anytime soon
4968.76 in an effective way,
4969.593 I think the short answer
is going to be no,
4971.91 that there are going to be chemicals
4973.37 and things that can augment
and support that process,
4977.24 but that there's not going
to be just a magic pill
4980.01 that will suddenly
reverse trauma altogether.
4982.08 That it's always going
to be a case whereby
4984.57 shifts in neurochemical states
4986.256 are going to have to be combined
4987.8 with new ways of thinking
and new behaviors.
4989.84 And I find it wonderful in reassuring
4991.9 that people are looking
at play and play behavior
4994.6 as a not just one tiny
shard of possibility there,
4998.67 but that it might actually
be the main driver
5001.03 and a highly productive lever
5003.4 by which to rewire the traumatized brain.
5006.01 So if you're like me,
you might be thinking,
5007.709 okay, I'm willing to be more playful.
5010.876 I'm willing to explore,
5012.54 play as a portal to plasticity.
5014.289 And that all makes good sense,
5017.175 but what should I play?
5019.28 What should I do?
5020.56 Well, we've already established
that you want to keep
5023.69 your adrenaline low.
5024.66 You have to keep the stakes slow enough
5026.67 that you're not going to get
totally consumed by the outcome.
5029.632 Now, for some people who
are highly competitive,
5032.38 that's going to be challenging.
5033.67 And yet I don't want to make it seem
5035.42 as if you can't be
competitive during play.
5037.73 There are many forms of competitive play
5039.96 that because you are a competitive person,
5043.4 allow you to drive great joy
from that competitive play.
5047.23 I have a friend who's
particularly good at horseshoes.
5050.09 I'm not particularly good at horseshoes,
5051.54 but whenever we play horseshoes,
5052.98 I can tell he's out there
to crush me on horseshoes.
5057.57 And it's just one of these
things where, you know,
5059.52 I can tell he derives great pleasure
5061.46 from crushing me at a game of horseshoes.
5063.583 I can't say because I
haven't actually done
5067.016 the microdialysis,
5067.849 which is a way of extracting chemistry
5069.44 from the brain in real time,
5071.13 nor have I recorded from his
brain or image it in a scanner,
5074.42 whether or not he has
high levels of epinephrine
5076.72 or low levels of epinephrine.
5078.0 During those games of horseshoes,
5079.07 I suspect his low levels of epinephrine
5081.04 and high levels of dopamine,
especially when he wins.
5083.76 And he has, he wins every time.
5085.73 But the win is that you can
be competitive during play,
5089.35 provided that you were enjoying yourself.
5092.03 Okay, you can be competitive
5093.44 provided that you were enjoying yourself.
5095.519 There are particular forms of play
5098.53 that lend themselves
best to neuroplasticity.
5101.91 And those particular forms of play again,
5104.63 are not designed to
necessarily just engage
5107.12 the plasticity that allows
you to perform that behavior,
5110.02 but rather to expand the
number of possibilities
5113.26 for your brain to change
in general throughout life
5116.55 and the two major forms of those
5119.06 for which there's good
Peer Reviewed Research
5121.29 is to engage in novel forms of movement,
5124.66 including different speeds of movement.
5127.2 So let's say for instance,
you're somebody who runs.
5129.93 I happen to like running.
5130.88 I try and run three times a week.
5132.308 And generally when I run, I run forward,
5135.48 I don't run backward, although recently,
5137.08 because I've become very excited
5138.6 about the work of so-called
"Knees Over Toes Guy,"
5141.35 his name is Ben Parker,
5143.02 but he goes by "Knees Over
Toes Guy" on Instagram.
5145.75 I've never met him,
5146.583 but we've exchanged a few
messages back and forth.
5149.15 And some of his practices involve
5151.73 walking backwards or doing
sled poles backwards.
5155.54 I found these to be very beneficial
5157.0 for my back and for my,
5158.81 you know, interior tibialis
5160.27 and some things that have really helped
5161.75 with my posture and so forth.
5163.96 But in general, when I run, I run forward,
5165.57 I don't tend to run backward that much.
5167.33 And I might do that for
a few minutes at the end,
5169.13 but not so much throughout the entire run.
5172.61 Running doesn't lend itself
to a lot of novel forms
5175.58 of movement, lateral movements.
5176.86 So for the nerds out there
movement in the Sagittal plane
5180.97 or angled movements,
5182.136 but it does appear that
things like dance or sports
5185.73 where you end up generating
a lot of dynamic movements
5189.15 where there's jumping,
5190.1 where there's movement
at different angles,
5192.07 where there's ducking,
where there's leaping,
5194.36 that basically involve a
lot of dynamic movement.
5196.93 And aren't just strictly linear.
5199.11 Those seem to open the
portals for plasticity.
5202.108 And that's because they mimic
a lot of the brain circuitry
5206.42 that is associated with play.
5208.52 And the reason for that
is the way in which
5210.3 those dynamic movements
5211.46 and movements of different speeds
5213.35 engage the vestibular system.
5215.03 The balance system,
5215.98 the vestibular system is in the inner ear,
5217.96 relates to the cerebellum,
5219.4 which translates the mini brain.
5220.457 You got a little mini brain
in the back of your brain.
5222.58 It brings together visual
information in a very direct way.
5225.919 I talked a lot about this in the episode
5228.17 on how to learn faster.
5229.58 So if you want to go in
depth on how vestibular
5231.658 and different types of motor
movements can open plasticity,
5234.43 I talk a little bit more, I
should say a lot more there,
5236.74 but suffice to say that engaging in play
5241.01 that has a lot of dynamic movement
5242.36 or movements of different speeds,
5243.65 things like dance,
5244.53 things like sports,
5245.363 like soccer where you're
moving in different dimensions.
5247.098 That tends to be very conducive
5249.679 to what we would call
play related circuitry
5252.36 provided you don't take it too seriously.
5254.61 You don't get those high
levels of epinephrine.
5256.23 Now for those of you that
5257.748 are also interested in non-physical
5261.31 or non-athletic forms of play
5263.64 that can really expand plasticity.
5265.579 There's some very interesting research
5267.53 about the game of Chess.
5269.29 I don't play the game of Chess.
5270.82 I've played a few times.
5271.95 I confess I don't know how
to move all the pieces.
5273.95 So I'm not going to try
and describe that here,
5275.401 but I've always wanted to learn Chess.
5276.827 And I think after reading some
of the Peer Reviewed Research
5279.37 about chess and play and neuroplasticity,
5281.43 now I understand why
5282.92 there's a really nice paper
5285.13 published in the International
Journal of Research
5287.16 in Education and Science in 2017.
5289.92 And the title of this paper is,
5291.252 "Is Chess Just a Game or Is It a Mirror
5295.03 That Reflects a Child's Inner World?"
5298.43 That's a very, a very intense title
5300.11 for a biologist like me,
5301.564 but this paper is so interesting
5304.8 because what it really points to is
5306.14 the fact that in a single game chess,
5309.57 you have at least as I
understand two players,
5311.871 and those two players are moving
pieces on the chess board,
5317.17 for which each piece can
do different things, right?
5320.45 Can move in different ways
under different scenarios,
5322.56 but they're different
rules for different pieces.
5324.3 And so each player actually has to assume
5326.61 multiple identities during the same game.
5329.75 And each of those identities
has different rules
5332.17 and ways of interacting.
5333.56 So in a way we can think
of chess as one game,
5336.39 but actually chess is
a kind of a substrate
5340.49 for exploring multiple roles
for different characters.
5343.82 And this is quite a bit different
5345.23 than for instance, video games
5346.71 where somebody has their
favorite video game player,
5349.66 or they have an avatar.
5350.87 And they're always in the same role.
5352.34 It's also quite a bit different
5353.65 for when you engage in any kind of play
5355.49 where you are yourself,
5356.57 you're just being you in that game.
5358.65 And so now I'm highly
incentivized to explore chess.
5362.111 You see quotes out there, for instance,
5365.55 things like "Chess is life
or jiu jitsu is life."
5369.1 I always assumed that that
meant that someone's entire life
5372.82 was chess
5373.653 or their entire life was
jiu jitsu for instance,
5376.712 but in reading over the research
about chess in particular,
5380.95 but at also certain forms of martial arts,
5382.78 also certain forms of dance.
5384.27 What one finds is that
5386.2 indeed those games are life
5388.53 in the sense that they involve
adopting multiple roles
5392.93 and exploring contingencies
in a number of different ways.
5395.69 So there are some games
5396.88 that allow you to explore
a much vaster landscape
5400.48 of movements or of mental roles
5402.57 or of ways of engaging
in strategic movement
5405.62 as is the case with chess.
5407.34 And so when you hear that,
5408.393 you know, activity blank is life.
5410.932 It often reflects the
passion for that activity,
5413.719 but I think looked at differently.
5415.55 It also reflects the
fact that that activity
5418.323 is a portal through which
you can explore life
5421.52 through many, many different lenses.
5424.16 And I think that that's
especially powerful
5426.374 in terms of thinking about how play
5428.33 can be leveraged for plasticity.
5429.99 So for those of you that are
interested in leveraging play
5433.01 for neuroplasticity and
expanding your mind,
5436.2 if you will,
5437.72 I highly recommend picking an activity
5440.2 that will allow you to
adopt different roles
5443.592 within that activity
5444.425 where it's not rigidly linear.
5445.68 This is actually a way in which
5447.45 I start to depart from
this modern and important,
5451.53 but somewhat narrow idea.
5453.86 That exercise is the
only route to plasticity.
5456.993 Yes, it's true.
5458.4 I have Nobel Prize winning colleagues
5460.313 that swim for two miles a day
5462.7 and have done on that for a long time.
5464.07 And they will tell you,
5464.95 I always think more
clearly after my swimming
5466.504 and I certainly in my
experience after a good run
5470.58 or a good workout, my
mind seems to work best.
5473.203 Unless of course, that workout
was very, very intense.
5475.81 I've talked about this before.
5476.87 If you do work out very, very hard
5479.19 in whether or not it's aerobic
5480.37 or resistance training
or sport of any kind,
5483.157 you brain won't function
as well afterwards,
5485.43 mostly because of the diversion of oxygen
5487.56 to tissues away from your brain,
5489.9 you actually are getting
less oxygen to your brain,
5491.88 but in general,
5492.713 most of us feel that if
we exercise regularly,
5494.33 our brain functions better.
5495.825 But there are activities that
extend beyond linear exercise,
5499.652 beyond just generating
the same sets of movements
5503.06 over and over again,
5503.893 when or not it's exercise or not.
5505.4 And that's really what play is.
5507.4 Play is about dynamically
exploring different kinds
5511.6 of movements,
5512.433 dynamically exploring
different kinds of thoughts,
5514.59 dynamically exploring
different kinds of roles
5517.8 that one could adopt.
5518.911 And that is the way that
the brain learns new things.
5522.6 So I encourage you to explore chess.
5524.61 I intend to learn chess this year.
5525.97 I'm very excited to do that.
5527.37 Now, if you already play chess
5529.2 and you are an expert chess player,
5531.09 you actually will derive less benefit
5533.86 in terms of this play
induced neuroplasticity
5536.98 than you would, for instance,
5538.19 if you went out,
5539.023 and I don't know, played a game of soccer
5541.04 or did something that was very novel
5542.41 for your nervous system,
5543.63 because in that novelty
5544.732 and in that exploration of new behaviors
5548.09 and new ways of thinking,
5549.373 you are opening the portal to plasticity,
5551.553 whereas in doing what you
already know how to do
5554.18 and trying just to perform
better and better at it,
5556.803 you will get better at chess,
5558.77 but again, that's just chess.
5560.8 You are not expanding the realms
5562.82 in which you can become more plastic,
5566.0 that you are able to learn new things
5568.48 in relationship,
5569.45 in life, in finance and
friendship, et cetera.
5572.04 In researching this episode,
5573.54 one of the most interesting
areas I discovered
5576.28 was this notion of personal play identity,
5579.49 personal play identity is a term
5581.93 that at least to my
knowledge was coined by
5583.98 a Turkish researcher by the name.
5586.95 And forgive me, I'm going
to mispronounce this
5589.06 is Gökhan Güneş
5591.54 G O K H A N,
5594.06 last name G U N E S.
5596.54 And forgive me Gökhan
5598.05 and if we have any Turkish
speaking members of the audience,
5601.43 please put the correction in
the comment section on YouTube,
5605.963 make it fanatic so I can
understand what it is.
5609.02 Please I'd love to
correct it and apologies,
5611.65 or who knows if I got it right
5613.49 then it was pure luck.
5614.712 Gökhan Güneş has coined this
term personal play identity,
5619.163 and the key role that
personal play identity
5624.48 establishes in who we
see ourselves as being,
5628.43 and not just in the context of play.
5630.58 Personal play identity
5631.94 has four well defined dimensions.
5634.51 And I should say that if you're interested
5635.83 in learning more about this,
5636.88 the paper that I found
particularly informative
5641.58 is published in Current Psychology
5644.2 and the title is "Personal play identity
5646.17 and the fundamental elements
in its development process."
5649.3 And the author of course,
5650.452 is Gökhan Güneş G U N E S last name.
5652.79 This is from 2021.
5654.05 So recent review.
5656.57 There are four components
to personal play identity,
5658.971 how you play,
5662.41 your personality,
5664.404 socio culture and environment.
5667.72 So that's the third one that's together,
5669.24 socio culture environment,
5670.35 and economics and technology.
5672.88 Now that sounds somewhat complex,
5674.51 and this paper is somewhat complex,
5675.97 but basically what it says is that
5677.622 we bring together certain
aspects of ourselves
5682.41 and how we react to
different place scenarios
5685.21 when we're younger.
5686.043 And we bring that forward into the world.
5688.41 In all context as adults.
5690.72 To illustrate this,
5691.77 I'm going to ask you a question,
5693.75 when you were a child,
5695.26 let's say 10 years old,
5698.29 would you have considered
yourself competitive?
5701.37 Would you have considered yourself
5702.85 somebody who's cooperative?
5704.25 And realize of course
5705.083 that those are not mutually exclusive,
5707.01 you could be competitive and cooperative.
5709.01 Would you consider yourself somebody
5710.65 that preferred to play alone
5712.62 or preferred to play with
one or two close friends?
5715.68 Or were you somebody that
really enjoyed playing
5718.23 in large groups?
5719.471 Here's a key one.
5721.6 Were you somebody that enjoyed
5724.15 playing the leader in one moment
5726.09 and was equally okay
5728.36 with being a follower at a later moment?
5731.01 Were you okay with
having your role switched
5733.37 midway through a game?
5735.21 Were you get up upset or be delighted
5738.57 or not care at all about
having to switch teams
5741.2 during the middle of game
5742.033 because your team was winning right?
5744.39 To even things out,
5745.61 you can imagine how that
would play out internally.
5748.75 You would immediately register
5750.07 that you must be a valuable player
5751.43 because you're being
moved off the winning team
5753.12 toward the losing team.
5754.652 But then again,
5756.07 you're now being forced
to join the losing team.
5759.21 How did you feel about that?
5760.883 Were you somebody that was comfortable
5763.01 with other people breaking rules
5764.46 or perhaps even yourself breaking rules
5767.0 or bending rules,
5769.14 kind of be able to find term,
5770.7 or were you somebody that
5772.54 really needed to know all the rules?
5774.08 And if everyone didn't
rigidly adhere to those rules
5777.44 was quite disturbed by that?
5780.452 The number of questions
goes on and on and on.
5782.77 And I will provide a link to a paper
5784.37 that asks a number of questions
5786.61 that helps you arrive at
a sort of score of sorts
5789.92 or an index of what Güneş
and others have referred
5793.62 to as personal play identity.
5795.67 The point is that
5796.71 if we look back to our early adolescence,
5799.51 somewhere between 10 and 14 years old,
5802.53 a peak time for social development,
5805.2 a peak time for play of various kinds,
5808.21 a peak time for motor development,
5810.342 a peak time of psychosocial development,
5814.1 where we learn where we
fit into hierarchies.
5816.35 As we relate to members of the same sex
5818.79 of the opposite sex, et cetera,
5821.26 we can start to get a portal into
5822.77 how and why we show up to
various activities in work
5826.767 and relationship, et cetera, as adults.
5829.96 In fact,
5831.5 I'll venture to say that
if we go into that process
5834.03 for ourselves for five or 10 minutes,
5835.89 you start to see some remarkable parallels
5838.09 between the way you were at that stage
5840.44 and your tendencies and
your preferences as adults.
5844.12 We tend to look at our
early childhood experiences
5846.87 and our families,
5848.22 and to some degree our friends
5849.47 in terms of how we become who we become.
5853.82 I've talked about the
incredible work of Allan Schore
5856.84 on previous episodes of the podcast.
5858.8 Allan Schore is a psychiatrist
5861.26 and has done extensive work
5863.14 on how parent child
interactions in particular baby
5866.052 and mother,
5867.25 but also baby and father
5869.48 shaped the brain
5870.98 and the brain and
emotional system's ability
5873.43 to go from states of
elation and excitement,
5875.593 the so-called dopamine
epinephrine type circuitry
5879.75 to the more warm soothing
types of calm interactions
5884.05 that in broad terms could be described
5886.05 as more serotonin oxytocin
and things of that sort.
5890.16 That work really points to the key roles
5892.67 that the caregiver
5894.032 and the child you
5896.49 engaged in an early life.
5898.34 And that is incredible work.
5899.558 I do hope to host Dr.
Schore on the podcast
5903.17 at some point in the
not too distant future,
5906.02 but equally important of course,
5908.17 are the interactions that we export
5910.06 from that early laying down
of biological circuitry
5913.99 and psychological circuitry,
5915.518 to the way we play by ourselves
5918.36 and the way we play with others
5920.262 in small numbers or in great numbers.
5922.831 And of course it would be the case
5925.73 that how we played as a 10 or 12 year old
5928.6 would impact how we
behave as a 16 year old
5931.09 and as a 20 year old and as a 30 year old
5933.27 and so on and so on.
5935.181 One of my favorite things
about developmental biology
5938.26 and developmental psychology
5939.518 is that it is grounded in the fact
5941.123 that we don't just have a
childhood and an adulthood.
5944.41 There isn't just our child
self and our adult self.
5947.11 And even though there
are transitions around
5949.13 the mechanisms that
underline neuroplasticity
5951.3 at approximately age 25,
5954.76 it is simply the case that development
5957.129 is our entire lifespan,
5959.03 that our lifespan is one
long developmental arc.
5962.59 How long depends on our
genetics, our lifestyle
5965.88 accidents, injury and disease of course,
5968.73 but it is one long developmental arc.
5971.6 And so it shouldn't surprise us at all
5973.33 that how we learn to play as
a 10 year old or 12 year old
5976.14 would impact how we play
and interact with people
5979.05 as a teenager and a young adult
5981.13 and on and on and on.
5982.872 And that play is the
place in which we explore
5986.84 in which we learn
5988.09 play is the substrate
5989.72 by which our nervous system changes us
5991.87 from this hyper-connected
batch of neurons,
5995.58 where everything is
connected to everything,
5997.67 more or less
5998.94 to a brain and nervous system whereby
6002.6 certain circuits work
with immense proficiency
6005.33 and others are less accessible to us.
6007.82 But again,
6008.653 the wonderful thing about
the human nervous system
6011.16 is that because it is plastic
6014.5 for the entire lifespan
6016.63 and because these two
elements of focus and rest
6019.33 can be deployed again
and again, and again,
6021.99 just because neural circuits didn't form
6023.99 does not mean that they
can't form later in life.
6027.0 And today we've been
focusing on how play itself,
6031.03 the same substrate that
we use during development
6033.38 to become who we are,
6034.96 is the portal by which
6036.17 we can change who we are
6037.54 for the better.
6038.55 So I hope I've convinced you
6039.73 that play is an extremely important
6041.99 fundamental homeostatically regulated
6044.76 aspect of our nervous system,
6046.4 which is just a mouthful
of nerd speak to say,
6050.1 play can change your brain for the better.
6052.58 And that is true for every stage of life.
6055.27 The recommendation that I make,
6057.09 and certainly the one that
I'm going to direct it myself
6059.75 as well
6060.95 is to try and engage in at least one hour
6064.34 of pure play per week.
6066.65 Now I came to that recommendation
6068.518 because of the literature that says,
6071.2 well, you need to engage
something pretty repetitively.
6073.734 It should be novel.
6075.61 So this wouldn't be something
6076.81 that you are exceptionally
good at already.
6079.44 If you insist on doing something
6081.17 that you're already exceptionally good at,
6083.12 then you want to really do some free form,
6085.89 low stakes tinkering.
6087.6 So make it safe,
6088.5 but make it free form.
6090.8 So really explore things with that.
6092.81 Some people call this beginner's mind.
6094.52 Although I find that a little abstract,
6096.09 I like the notion of beginner's mind,
6097.47 but sort of like,
6098.303 how do you know if you're
in beginner's mind?
6099.7 I think beginner's mind
is sort of the expectation
6102.01 that you're not going to do it well yet,
6103.548 but play extends beyond beginner's mind.
6107.14 Play is really about
6108.51 not even worrying if you're
going to get good at it
6110.65 or really proficient at it.
6112.17 It's really about exploring contingencies
6114.74 with truly low stakes.
6116.27 That's what will allow you to access
6117.99 these neurochemical combinations
6120.05 of elevated endogenous opioids,
6121.87 low epinephrine, et cetera,
6123.2 that will open up neuroplasticity.
6124.998 For those of you that need
a little more guidance
6127.4 on how to play.
6129.13 There's a book out there
6130.11 actually learned about this
from Tim Ferriss' blog,
6132.59 it's called "Play It Away: A
Workaholic's Cure for Anxiety."
6135.85 So that's more focused on anxiety.
6137.17 The author is Charlie Hoehn,
6139.08 last name H O E H N
6142.47 will provide a link for it in
the show notes and caption,
6144.327 "Play It Away: A Workaholic's
Cure for Anxiety."
6147.67 But books and other resources aside,
6150.96 I think one hour of play per week
6152.85 is a reasonable amount of time
6155.0 to engage in dedicated play behavior.
6157.8 For the purpose of opening
up these neural circuits
6160.79 for plasticity,
6162.179 the key feature of course,
6163.57 is to not have immense proficiency
in that given activity,
6167.23 or at least not the way you perform it.
6169.09 And if you do gain
proficiency in that activity,
6171.738 well, then it becomes something else
6173.64 it's no longer about
play it's performance.
6175.649 So in that case,
6177.55 you would then want to
adopt a new play behavior.
6180.74 You'll notice that I largely avoided
6182.35 using the word fun
throughout this episode.
6185.07 Fun is a somewhat abstract term
6186.92 and like many emotions and
many verbal descriptions
6191.65 of experience.
6192.5 It falls short in the context of
6194.93 a neurobiologic goal
discussion about play.
6197.93 If you have fun, terrific.
6199.7 Some people might find,
6200.79 however that engaging in play
is kind of uncomfortable.
6203.78 Well there, your goal then
should be to lower your level
6205.91 of discomfort
6206.94 by focusing less on the outcomes
6209.0 and just simply engaging
in the behavior because,
6211.538 well, I'm telling you
that it's good for you,
6214.08 but hopefully you will tell yourself
6215.53 that it's good for you
6216.363 and that you will experience
that it's good for you.
6219.67 The literature certainly points to that.
6221.74 And the literature certainly
points to the fact that
6224.57 play is the way that we are built.
6226.8 We are built to play.
6228.67 We have brain circuits from back to front
6231.82 and within our body that are there
6233.59 for play and they don't disappear.
6235.31 They do not get pruned away
6237.22 as we go from development to adulthood.
6239.24 So if ever you needed a
neurobiological explanation
6242.09 for why play is important
throughout the lifespan,
6244.89 it's that.
6245.91 It's that biology does
not waste resources.
6248.74 It's a extremely efficient.
6250.3 And were the circuits for
play not to be important
6254.07 in adulthood.
6254.903 They would've been pruned
away, but I guarantee you,
6257.07 they are there in your brain
and nervous system now,
6259.77 they will be there tomorrow
6260.76 and they will be there going forward.
6262.35 So my suggestion is that you use them.
6264.38 One hour per week.

6308.46 we are hubermanlab on Twitter
6309.92 and also hubermanlab on Instagram,
6312.72 on Instagram,
6313.81 I do short posts that
are related to topics
6316.78 covered on the podcast, but
also some additional topics.
6319.63 So these would include science based tools
6321.88 for things like focus for sleep,
6323.41 for learning and many
other topics as well.
6325.89 In previous episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast,
6328.07 we often refer to supplements.
6329.978 Now supplements aren't necessary
or correct for everybody,
6333.56 but many people derive
tremendous benefit from them
6336.13 for things like sleep and focus and so on.
6339.08 We've partnered with
Thorne that's T H O R N E
6342.14 because Thorn supplements are
of the very highest quality
6344.94 in terms of the ingredients they use.
6346.6 And the specificity of the
amounts of the ingredients
6349.361 that are listed on the bottle
6351.07 are actually what is in those bottle,
6353.41 which is not the case for many
supplement brands out there.
6356.26 If you're interested in
seeing the supplements
6357.71 that I take, you can go
to thorne.com/u/huberman
6362.04 So that's thorne.com/u/huberman.
6367.8 And those supplements you
can purchase at 20% off.
6370.71 And if you navigate deeper
into the Thorne site,
6373.09 through that URL portal,
6374.95 you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements
6377.64 that Thorne makes.
6378.63 Thank you once again,
6379.49 for joining me for this discussion
6381.16 about the incredible
biology and psychology
6383.73 and power of this thing that we call play
6386.67 and last but certainly not least
6388.9 thank you for your interest in science.
