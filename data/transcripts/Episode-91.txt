0.37 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast
2.35 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.93 for everyday life.
9.47 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.5 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.32 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.28 This podcast is separate from my teaching
17.03 and research roles at Stanford.
18.71 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
20.93 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
23.8 and science-related tools
to the general public.
26.9 In keeping with that theme,
28.17 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
31.28 Our first sponsor is ROKA.
33.46 ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses.
36.07 And I'm delighted that they're a partner
37.98 and a sponsor for the podcast.
40.1 As some of you may already
know I've spent two decades
43.07 or more studying the visual system,
45.02 how we see?
45.853 Vision is absolutely
the most important sense
48.52 by which humans navigate
the world and survive.
51.04 And our eyes as two pieces of our brain
53.27 do many other important things as well.
55.49 So taking good care of
our eyesight is essential.
58.45 Founded by two All-Americans
swimmers from Stanford.
61.33 ROKA was born out of an
obsession for performance.
64.37 They've carefully put science and purpose
65.88 behind their design choices
67.22 and they built absolutely
terrific products as a result.
70.25 The glasses are amazing.
71.23 I love them because they look great.
73.99 They are super comfortable
75.3 and the optical clarity is incredible.
78.21 They filter out sunlight in a way
79.813 that still allows you to
see contrast and shadows
82.38 the way you need to.
83.213 And for me, one of the things
that's really irritating
85.01 is if I have a pair of sunglasses
86.72 that don't allow me to see
all the things I want to see.
89.69 And with ROKA glasses,
91.56 I get incredible contrast
but then I can also relax
94.57 and be outdoors in bright light.
96.08 And as the amount of light
changes with cloud cover
98.6 and things of that sort,
99.99 my ability to see my surroundings
101.56 coz it's still really
sharp and really clear.
103.147 And that only comes from
really understanding
105.51 how the visual system works,
106.91 and how it adjusts to
contrast and adaptation
109.63 and all these different things.
110.48 They really understand the science
112.16 and that went into the
design of these glasses.
114.69 And as many of you know,
116.13 sunlight and the viewing of light
117.97 is also very important for
setting circadian rhythm.
120.71 So that's also been incorporated
into the design and science
123.41 behind these glasses.
124.77 I do wear readers.
125.89 I don't often wear them
during the podcast,
127.86 but I have to wear
reading glasses at night.
129.55 So I use their readers and I
own a pair of their sunglasses.
132.99 And I'm delighted with them.

149.31 Today's podcast is also brought
to you by InsideTracker.
152.17 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
155.26 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
157.71 to help you better understand your body
159.26 and reach your health goals.
161.09 I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done
163.87 for the simple reason that
many of the important things
167.24 that are vital to our
immediate and long-term health
170.57 can only be detected in a
good quality blood test.
174.3 The problem with blood tests
is that most blood tests
177.35 you get a lot of information
back about that are too high
179.96 or too low of this thing
or the other thing.
181.97 But making sense of that,
182.947 and what to do with that
information is very challenging.
185.63 Even if you have a really
attentive physician,
188.18 oftentimes it's mysterious
189.93 as to what to do with all this data.
191.84 With InsideTracker, they make
it very easy to understand
194.57 what all the metabolic factors,
hormone factors, et cetera,
198.08 mean for you and what to
do about those markers.
201.08 So they offer you directives
in terms of nutrition,
203.81 supplementation, as well
as lifestyle factors
206.8 like exercise, sleep, et cetera,
209.07 that can allow you to take
control of those numbers
211.47 and bring them into the
ranges that are best for you
214.28 and your long-term health.
215.91 Another feature of InsideTracker
217.28 that's great is their inner age test.
219.47 This test shows you
what your biological age
221.53 and how it compares to
your chronological age,
223.7 which I can only imagine
most everybody including me
226.76 are extremely interested in
how long am I likely to live?
229.04 How old am I really in
terms of my biology?
232.52 If you'd like to try InsideTracker

242.94 Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.
246.13 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
247.77 vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink.
250.27 I've been using Athletic
Greens since 2012,
252.87 and so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.
256.04 With athletic greens,
257.06 you get a ton of factors
that are good for you
259.75 mixed into this one
really good tasting drink.
262.21 I like to mix mine with water
263.64 and a little bit of lemon juice,
265.02 and I drink that once or twice a day.
266.9 Typically, once early in the day,
268.77 and sometimes also in the
afternoon or even evening.
271.53 I'm able to sleep after drinking
in the evening just fine.
274.69 The reason I been using
Athletic Greens for so long
277.4 that I continue to use
Athletic Greens is that,
280.03 one, I feel better when I take it.
281.86 I just do.
282.693 Psychologically,
physically, I feel better.
284.95 But also it covers all
my bases of the things
287.7 that I need for my general health.
289.78 It's sort of a foundational
supplement as I like to call it.
292.53 In fact, when people ask me,
293.82 what should I take?
295.43 If I were to recommend just one supplement
297.23 that people take it
would be Athletic Greens.
300.0 With Athletic Greens, you
get support for your gut
302.67 which is important,
303.61 because the gut microbiome is important
305.297 for the gut brain access,
for mood, metabolism,
307.92 hormones, et cetera.
308.83 There are so many data that
support that statement.
311.49 As well, there are many
factors in Athletic Greens
314.87 that support general health metabolism,
316.92 endocrine factors, immunity, et cetera.
319.52 So with Athletic Greens, I
drink it once or twice a day.
322.03 And I know that I've got all that covered.
324.18 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
325.65 you can go to
www.athleticgreens.com/huberman.
328.82 And if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.
331.16 They'll send you five free travel packs
332.94 plus a year supplies, excuse me,
335.25 of vitamin D3+K2.
337.52 So you get the five free travel packs
339.59 and a year supply of D3
340.93 if you go to
www.athleticgreens.com/huberman
344.04 you can claim that special offer.
345.79 For the last month four
episodes to be exact,
349.38 we've been discussing physical performance
351.52 and skill learning.
353.45 We've talked about how
to learn skills faster,
356.08 whether or not those are
skills, athletic performance,
359.1 dance, music, things of that sort.
362.21 We've also talked about
how to gain strength
364.45 and how to lose fat faster by
leveraging the nervous system.
368.01 Things like shiver and non-shiver,
371.33 non-exercise activity
induced thermogenesis.
374.49 We talked about how neurons
can actually trigger
377.26 accelerated fat loss.
379.2 We talked about hypertrophy
also called muscle growth
382.49 and we covered everything
from sets and reps protocols,
386.28 how long to stay in a cold ice bath?
388.17 When to get out?
389.39 How to keep shivering?
390.76 We've covered a lot of
tools and a lot of science.
393.76 So if you're interested in those things
395.12 and you even perhaps want
to learn a little bit about
398.4 how we make energy ATP from
carbohydrates or from fats,
402.51 it's all covered in the
previous four episodes.
405.32 This was going to be the time
406.57 that we moved to a new topic entirely,
409.54 but we are going to do one
more episode in this series
412.51 on physical performance.
413.84 For the simple reason that
you asked many questions
417.58 about something that's vitally important
419.71 both for physical
performance and long-term
422.27 and short-term health
and that's endurance.
426.01 And so today we are going
to talk about endurance.
428.92 Now, if you're a strength athlete
430.86 or you're not interested in endurance,
434.39 don't depart just yet,
435.71 because it turns out that there
are ways to train endurance
438.66 that are very different
440.42 than I would have previously imagined.
443.32 If you only think about long runs,
445.66 long swims, marathons,
half marathons, 10Ks, 5Ks
449.8 and that sort of thing puts you to sleep
451.71 kind of like Costello is
snoring in the background
453.62 right now.
454.79 He's not a long distance
endurance athlete,
457.45 that's for sure.
459.57 If you're interested in those things
461.05 or if you are averse to those things,
463.55 I encourage you to continue listening
465.38 because we are going to talk
about a little bit of science
468.32 and then some specific protocols
470.18 that really define what endurance is?
472.64 The four types of endurance
474.22 and ways to train those in
concert with the other things
478.23 that you might be doing
like weight training
480.18 or skill training or yoga.
483.35 And if you are an endurance athlete,
485.38 we are going to cover a
lot of tools and science
488.32 that I'm certain will also
help enhance your training
491.14 and performance in races
493.17 or even just recreationally.
495.49 The topic of endurance I think
497.99 has been badly misrepresented,
frankly, online.
502.16 And when you'd start
digging into the science
504.2 and you start talking to
real experts in this area,
507.29 what you discover, what
I've discovered is that,
509.53 it's an incredibly interesting area
511.41 because it teaches us so
much about how our body
514.59 and our brain use fuels and
how we can control which fuels
520.23 are used by our body and brain?
522.54 So today we will talk about
the four kinds of endurance.
525.99 We will also cover the topic of hydration
528.87 which might sound incredibly boring.
531.56 Like, okay, just drink more water.
533.4 But it's really interesting
534.95 because not only is
hydration a limiting factor
538.8 on performance,
539.633 but there is a right way to hydrate,
542.17 and there is a wrong way to hydrate.
544.24 There actually is a formula
545.7 that I'll teach you to know
how much water to be drinking
549.84 depending on your activity levels.
551.35 And if that sounds like a simple thing,
553.85 like, oh, just tap off water
until your urine runs clear.
557.07 That's actually the wrong advice.
559.4 It turns out that if you
don't hydrate properly,
561.45 you can see 20 to 30%
reductions in performance,
564.45 whether or not that strength,
566.04 whether that's increasing hypertrophy,
568.58 whether or not that's running, swimming,
570.32 even mental performance.
572.14 So even if you're not an athlete
573.74 or a recreational athlete at all,
575.5 I encourage you to stay tuned
for the part about hydration.
578.93 So we're going to cover as
usual a little bit of science
581.76 and then we're going to
dive right into protocols
584.02 that you can apply if you like,
585.427 and if you deem those
correct and safe for you.
588.94 Before we dive into all that,
590.18 I want to make an important announcement,
591.67 which has all the episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast
594.89 are now housed on a single website,
597.43 which is www.hubermanlab.com.
599.91 If you go to www.hubermanlab.com,
601.7 you can find all the episodes in YouTube,
604.14 Apple and Spotify format with links there.
607.13 The website is also searchable.
608.87 So if you go into the
little search function
610.77 which you'll find very easily,
611.89 and you put in, for
instance, creatine or sleep
615.51 or ice bath or sauna,
617.73 it will take you to the specific episodes
620.65 that contain that information.
622.97 And in addition, if you go to the website
625.53 www.hubermanlab.com,
626.41 you have the opportunity to sign up
628.52 for what we call the
Huberman Lab Neural Network.
631.7 The Huberman Lab Neural
Network is a zero cost resource
634.59 where once a month perhaps more often
637.42 you'll receive a email newsletter,
640.31 and that newsletter will
contain specific protocols,
643.34 announcements, attachments of
PDFs and things of that sort
647.03 of protocols, tools and
science from the podcast.
651.0 We will also make any
announcements about live lectures
655.19 which at some point I'll
probably start doing
656.95 in various cities in the US
658.61 and probably around the world as well,
660.55 as well as other things that I think
662.24 would be really useful to you
all of course at zero cost.
665.74 So that's www.hubermanlab.com,
667.58 sign up for the Neural Network newsletter.
670.02 You can find that in the menu tab
671.59 or it might pop up when you get there.
673.48 And I hope you will join.
675.04 And as a final announcement,
676.99 if you're not already
following us on Instagram,
679.61 you can go to Huberman Lab on Instagram.
681.6 And if you do that,
682.62 I often make announcements
and release protocols
685.25 and links to protocols
and things there as well.
688.34 I briefly want to touch on something
689.76 from the previous episode which is that,
693.13 if you are somebody that is trying
694.43 to increase muscle strength and or size,
697.51 or if you're simply somebody
699.27 who doesn't want to increase
muscle strength and size,
702.49 and you just want to maintain
the musculature that you have,
705.96 it's vital that you
perform at least five sets
708.69 of resistance training
per muscle per week.
712.27 If we don't do that, we
lose muscle over time.
715.18 And that is one reason among many
719.03 to have a regular resistance
training protocol.
722.75 Nobody wants to start resembling
a folded over envelope
726.35 or a melted candle.
728.33 No one wants to have challenges
getting up out of a chair
730.77 or off the ground.
732.33 Maintaining musculature is vital,
734.3 not just to our immediate health,
736.03 but to our long-term health trajectory.
738.81 So I just want to emphasize that point.
740.43 If you're curious about
the sets, the reps,
742.73 how close to failure to go or not go?
745.55 Whether or not you should be doing
747.38 your cardiovascular training
749.13 before or after your weight training?
750.7 All of that is in the previous episode
752.63 right down to the details,
753.84 and I like to think made
simple for you to understand.
757.19 But I do strongly believe
that resistance training
759.89 whether or not it's with body
weight or bands or weights
763.24 or simply lifting rocks in
the yard or logs in the yard
766.93 is vital for our systemic
physiology and our overall health,
771.33 and that includes our brain health.
772.87 And I described the reasons
for that and the mechanisms
775.14 in the previous episode.
776.62 Today, I'd like to talk about endurance
778.81 and how to build endurance,
781.05 and how to use endurance for
the health of your entire body.
786.58 Endurance, as the name suggests
is our ability to engage
790.08 in continuous bouts of exercise,
792.8 or continuous movement or
continuous effort of any kind.
798.08 And I do believe that our
ability to engage in activities
803.51 that we call endurance training
805.87 or physical endurance activities
808.24 do have carry over to
mental performance of things
813.55 that require long-term effort.
816.32 I'll touch on that at the end
817.61 and why there's reason to believe
819.65 that there is a biological crossover
821.6 between those two things.
823.62 I don't think it's simply the case
824.95 that if you train
yourself to be a strength
826.407 and speed athlete and to
do short bouts of exercise
829.12 are very intense,
830.26 that you can only do mental work
832.54 that's of short bouts and very intense.
835.55 But it is clear that
cardiovascular exercise,
840.54 exercise where you're
getting your heart rate up
842.61 continuously for a period of time,
844.32 and endurance exercise we will define
846.27 what that is in a moment,
847.89 is vital for tapping into
and enhancing various aspects
852.41 of our biology in the
body end in the brain
856.04 such that our brain can perform work
859.64 for longer periods of time,
861.12 focused work, learning, et cetera.
863.96 So I want to dive into
the topic of endurance
866.53 and I want to just begin
by addressing something
870.26 that's vital to any kind of effort,
873.03 whether that's mental
effort or physical effort.
875.24 So as always a little bit of science
876.72 and we'll get right into protocols.
878.87 So the key thing to understand
881.47 about energy production in the body,
883.58 meaning your ability to think,
885.13 your ability to talk,
your ability to walk,
887.53 your ability to run is this
thing that we call ATP.
892.06 ATP and mitochondria,
which are just little
897.03 what we call organelles within cells.
899.12 These little factories that
make energy, if you will.
904.08 ATP is required for anything
that requires energy,
908.05 for anything that you
do that requires effort.
910.92 And there are different ways to get ATP.
915.34 And we have been gifted as
a species with the ability
919.87 to convert lots of things into ATP.
924.06 We can convert carbohydrates,
926.72 literally the kinds of
carbohydrates eat a bagel,
928.69 you eat a piece of pizza.
929.8 Pizza usually is dough, and it has cheese
932.76 and some other things.
934.39 Costello hears me talking about pizza.
935.76 Costello loves pizza, by the way.
938.47 Eating a piece of pizza,
939.45 it gets converted into various things,
942.08 fatty acids from the fats,
glucose from the bread,
946.99 and those things get converted
into ATP within cells,
952.39 through things like like
glycolysis, things like lipolysis.
955.27 I talked about this in previous episodes.
957.29 So our muscles and our neurons
use different fuel sources
962.77 to generate ATP.
965.55 The ones that are used
first for short bouts
968.32 of intense activity are
things like phosphocreatine.
970.92 If you've only heard about
creatine as a supplement.
972.92 Well, phosphocreatine actually
exists on our muscles,
975.347 and that's why people take creatine.
976.92 You can load your muscles
with more creatine.
979.12 And though, and excuse me.
981.9 Phosphocreatine is great for
short, intense bouts of effort.
986.54 So when you're really pushing
hard on something physical,
988.9 let's say you see a car
on the side of the road
990.83 and that car is stalled and a person says,
992.847 "Hey, can you help me push my car?"
994.2 And you start to push.
995.659 That's going to be phosphocreatine
996.55 is going to be your main fuel source.
998.34 Then you start to tap
into things like glucose
1000.99 which is literally just
carbohydrate is the sugar
1003.36 that's in your blood.
1004.81 And then if you keep pushing on that car,
1007.04 you keep engaging in a particular effort,
1009.45 or you keep studying or you
keep listening to this podcast,
1012.61 you start to tap into other
fuel sources like glycogen
1015.81 from your liver, which is just,
1017.09 it's like a little pack,
1018.45 just like you might have packed a sandwich
1020.59 or something for work.
1022.39 You have a little pack
of glycogen in your liver
1025.62 that you can rely on.
1027.22 And you have fat stored in adipose tissue.
1029.87 Even if you have very, very
low body fat percentage
1033.1 like you're one of these people
as like 3% or 5% body fat
1036.5 really thin skin, very little body fat,
1040.29 you can extract lipids fatty
acids from that body fat.
1044.87 It's like a storage pack,
1046.04 it is a storage pack for energy
1047.68 that can be converted to ATP.
1049.47 So without going into any more detail,
1053.09 when I say today energy or I say ATP,
1055.99 just remember that
regardless of your diet,
1059.74 regardless of your nutritional plan,
1061.92 your body has the
capacity to use creatine,
1065.81 glucose, glycogen, lipids.
1068.27 And if you're ketogenic, ketones.
1070.84 We'll talk about ketosis.
1072.89 In order to generate fuel, energy.
1076.8 Now, the other crucial point is that,
1079.62 in order to complete that
process of taking these fuels
1083.1 and converting them into energy,
1085.61 most of the time you need oxygen.
1089.82 You need air basically in your system.
1092.35 Now, it's not actual air.
1093.41 You need oxygen molecules in your system,
1096.5 comes in through your mouth and your nose,
1098.41 goes to your lungs and
distributes via the bloodstream.
1102.14 Oxygen is not a fuel,
1104.77 but like a fire that has no oxygen
1107.9 you can't actually burn the logs,
1109.94 but when you blow a lot
of oxygen onto a fire,
1114.21 basically, onto logs with a flame there,
1117.56 then basically it will take fire,
1120.76 it will burn.
1121.593 Okay?
1122.426 Oxygen allows you to burn fuel.
1125.17 So today we are going to
ask the critical questions.
1129.09 What allows us to perform?
1131.84 What allows us to continue
effort for long periods of time?
1136.0 And that effort could be a run,
1137.65 it could be a swim,
1138.73 it could be studying,
1140.21 it could be anything that extends
1142.41 over a long period of time.
1144.62 Well, you're going to need energy
1146.36 and you're going to need oxygen.
1148.54 But the way to answer a question
1150.95 like what allows us to endure, right?
1154.36 Endurance.
1155.193 What allows us to keep going?
1157.71 Well, we think of things like willpower.
1159.69 But what's willpower?
1160.523 Willpower is neurons.
1162.14 It's neurons in our brain.
1163.96 We have this thing called
the central governor
1165.59 which decides whether or not
we should or could continue
1168.61 or whether or not we should stop,
1171.16 whether or not we should quit.
1172.93 Okay?
1173.763 So whether or not you're somebody
1174.81 who has a lot of what
we would call resilience
1176.91 and endurance,
1177.743 or whether or not you're
somebody who taps out early
1179.99 and quits early or can't
handle frustration,
1182.19 that has to do with your fuel utilization
1184.46 and specific neurons.
1185.81 So we have to ask the question,
1187.96 what is the limiting
factor on performance?
1191.1 Right?
1191.933 So instead of saying,
what allows us to endure?
1193.83 We should say, what
prevents us from enduring?
1196.58 What prevents us from moving forward?
1198.53 What are the factors that say,
1200.36 you know what?
1201.23 No more, I'm not going
to continue this run.
1203.81 Or you know what?
1205.07 I've had a really long, hard day
1207.04 or maybe I've had an easy
day or I'm feeling lazy,
1209.03 I just don't even really feel
like getting up and moving.
1211.64 So what we're going to talk about today
1212.87 actually gets right down
to the heart of motivation
1215.76 and fuel use.
1216.8 Motivation and fuel allocation.
1219.48 And we are going to talk about
specific training protocols
1222.28 that you can follow that have carry over
1225.7 between the bodily systems of
running swimming, et cetera,
1229.22 and the way that your brain works.
1231.36 So let's talk about
endurance by asking first,
1233.9 what are the limiting
factors on endurance?
1236.86 What stops us?
1238.66 Because in addressing
that and answering that,
1240.92 we will understand what
allows us to get into effort
1244.78 and to continue effort.
1246.36 There are five main categories of things
1248.765 that allow us to engage in effort.
1251.87 And they are neurons, nerves, muscle,
1257.16 muscle, blood, things in our blood,
1261.61 our heart and our lungs.
1264.67 Now, I don't want to
completely write off things
1266.96 like the immune system and
other systems of the body,
1270.02 but nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs
1273.33 are the five that I
want to focus on today,
1275.37 because that's where most of the data are.
1279.01 As we go forward into this,
1280.26 I want to acknowledge Dr. Andy Galpin,
1283.17 who as with the last episode,
1285.247 has been tremendously
helpful and informative
1288.13 in terms of the exercise physiology.
1290.04 He's a true expert.
1291.84 He has a laboratory,
1292.97 he's a full professor who
does work on muscle biopsy,
1297.47 who understands the science,
1298.81 but who also works with athletes
1300.93 and works with recreational athletes,
1303.17 professional athletes really understands
1305.32 at a variety of levels how
all these systems work?
1307.74 He's the person I consulted
with about today's episode,
1310.99 although I did access
other literature as well.
1312.86 And I'm going to mention a
key review for any of you,
1316.06 afficionados, who really want
to get down into the weeds.
1318.5 But I encourage you,
if you want more detail
1321.35 to check out Dr. Andy
Galpin's YouTube page,
1324.28 I think he's also on Twitter.
1325.88 He's definitely on Instagram.
1327.7 His content is excellent,
1329.64 and he really understands...
1332.005 I have learned and I really believe
1333.19 that an intellectual is somebody
1335.37 who understands a topic at multiple levels
1338.5 of specificity of detail
and can communicate that.
1341.6 And Andy is a true intellectual
of muscle physiology
1345.67 and performance.
1346.81 And if you hear the word intellectual
1348.62 and you kind of back up
and cringe from that,
1350.77 understand that he's also a practitioner.
1353.07 So thank you, Andrew Galpin.
1355.3 Andy Galpin for your
support in these episodes
1360.46 and we hope to have you as
a guest on the podcast soon.
1364.29 So nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs.
1366.21 Let's talk about neurons
and how they work.
1368.47 Okay?
1369.303 But I want to tell you about an experiment
1371.16 that's going to make it very clear
1373.88 why quitting is a mental
thing not a physical thing.
1378.34 So why do we quit?
1380.01 Well, an experiment was
done a couple years ago
1382.59 and was published in the journal Cell.
1384.16 Cell Press journal, excellent journal
1386.48 showing that there is a class
of neurons in our brain stem,
1391.54 in the back of our brain that
if they shut off, we quit.
1399.0 Now, these neurons release epinephrin.
1404.03 Epinephrin is adrenaline.
1405.25 And anytime we are engaged
in effort of any kind,
1408.23 we are releasing epinephrin.
1409.73 Anytime we're awake really,
we are releasing epinephrin
1412.96 into our brain.
1415.21 In fact, this little roup of neurons
1418.74 in the back of our brain is
called the locus coeruleus
1420.93 if you like.
1421.98 It's churning out epinephrin all the time,
1424.26 but if something stresses us out,
1425.97 it churns out more and then it acts
1427.88 as kind of an alertness
signal for the whole brain.
1430.72 We also of course have
adrenaline epinephrin
1432.83 released in our body which
makes our body ready for things.
1435.69 So think about epinephrin
as a readiness signal.
1438.65 And when we are engaged in effort,
1441.06 this readiness signal is
being churned into our brain.
1443.31 When we relax and we're falling asleep,
1445.03 epinephrin levels are low.
1447.81 Okay, so they did a really
interesting experiment
1451.87 where they had subjects
engage in bouts of effort
1457.54 of trying to move forward toward a goal.
1460.22 But they manipulated
the visual environment
1462.55 with the stripes,
1463.52 kind of like fences passing
on both sides of them.
1467.22 And by doing that, they
could trick subjects
1470.34 into thinking that their
effort was either allowing them
1473.99 to move forward, right?
1475.46 Because these rungs on the
fence were moving past,
1479.2 or that their effort was futile
1481.88 that they were no longer moving forward
1483.46 because they would make
the runs move slowly
1485.31 even though the subjects
were making a lot of effort
1487.73 to move forward.
1488.95 Okay?
1489.783 So this is analogous or
similar to being on a treadmill
1492.4 and you're trying to
walk on this treadmill
1494.24 and you just can't move
the conveyor, right?
1497.32 Or you're in virtual reality
1499.01 and you're putting a ton of effort,
1500.47 but it seems like you're
moving excruciatingly slow.
1502.67 I had this experience
recently in real life.
1505.29 I was doing a swim in the Pacific,
1507.45 I was trying to go
south and I was swimming
1510.66 and I was caught in a current,
1512.08 not the cup that pulls you out to ocean.
1514.2 And I kept looking to my left,
1516.37 and I saw this hotel on the shoreline,
1519.1 and then I was swimming and swimming
1520.86 and swimming and swimming,
1521.78 and 20 minutes later I looked
to my left and the hotel
1524.25 is still exactly where it was before,
1526.19 which meant that I wasn't moving.
1528.44 It felt futile.
1530.54 Eventually, either the current
changed or something changed
1534.35 and I eventually swam past the hotel,
1537.67 got back on the beach and
eventually drove home.
1541.22 That's essentially what
they did in this experiment.
1543.18 But what they found was these neurons
1545.5 that release epinephrin,
1548.44 there's another cell type called glia,
1551.34 which actually means glue in Latin,
1553.31 that is paying attention
to how much epinephrin
1555.51 is being released.
1556.343 And at some point the
system reaches a threshold.
1560.09 It reaches this threshold
1561.38 and it shuts off the
release of more epinephrin.
1564.41 It's like I quit, that's it,
1566.17 no more effort signal.
1569.24 If they could extend the time
1572.16 before those glia said, ah, enough.
1575.81 If they could release more
adrenaline into the system,
1578.34 then subjects would keep going.
1580.67 So our desire to continue
or put differently,
1585.69 our willingness to continue
and our desire to quit
1589.49 is mediated by events
between our two ears.
1593.47 Now, that doesn't mean that
the body's not involved,
1595.58 but it means that neurons
are critically important.
1597.71 So we have two categories of
neurons that are important.
1599.95 The ones in our head that tell us get up
1602.04 and go out and take that run.
1603.86 And the ones that allow us
and encourage us to continue
1607.84 that run,
1608.673 and we have neurons that shut things off
1610.2 and say no more.
1611.4 And we of course have the neurons
1612.95 that connect to our muscles
and control our muscles.
1615.67 But the reason we quit is
rarely because our body quits,
1619.64 our mind quits.
1621.54 Now, we never want to encourage people
1622.81 to drive themselves to
the point of injury,
1625.96 that's not going to be good for anybody,
1629.46 but it is good to know that it's neural.
1633.15 Our ability to persist is neural.
1635.06 So when people say is it, I hear that,
1637.53 you know, sports or effort or fighting,
1639.97 or it's 90% mental, 10% physical.
1645.22 That whole discussion
about how much is mental,
1647.23 how much is physical?
1648.063 Is absolutely silly.
1649.32 It just proves that there's no knowledge
1651.67 of the underlying biology
behind that statement.
1654.39 It's neither mental nor physical.
1656.68 Everything is physical,
1658.72 everything is neurons.
1660.05 Your thinking is the
responsibility of chemicals
1663.33 and electrical signals in your head.
1664.83 So it's not 90% mental, 10% physical.
1667.91 It's not 50/50.
1669.11 It's not 70/30, it's 100% nervous system.
1673.9 It's neurons.
1675.41 Okay?
1676.243 So when people say mental or physical,
1678.24 understand it's 100% neural.
1681.09 And I'd love for the,
how much of it is mental
1683.814 and how much is physical
to just disappear.
1687.56 That argument means nothing
1688.72 and it's not actionable.
1690.07 Now, what do nerves need in
order to continue to fire?
1693.84 What do you need in order
to get neurons to say,
1696.65 I will persist.
1697.89 Well, they need glucose.
1699.88 Unless you're on keto
and ketogenic adapted,
1704.11 you need carbohydrate is glucose.
1706.4 That's what neurons run on.
1708.89 And you need electrolytes.
1711.73 Neurons have what's called
a sodium potassium pump
1715.05 blah, blah, blah.
1715.883 They generate electricity.
1716.84 We could go into all this.
1717.82 I will probably do an entire lecture
1719.09 about the action potential,
1720.07 but basically in order to
get nerve cells to fire,
1723.93 to contract muscle,
1725.26 to say, I'm going to continue.
1726.9 You need sufficient sodium, salt,
1729.97 because the action potential
the actual firing of neurons
1734.51 is driven by sodium entering the cell,
1737.32 rushing into the cell.
1738.94 And then there's a removal of potassium.
1741.93 And then there's a kind of
resetting of those levels
1744.37 by something called the
sodium potassium pump.
1746.09 And the sodium potassium pump and sodium
1748.014 and action potentials,
1749.89 even if you don't know anything
about that is ATP dependent.
1753.58 It requires energy.
1755.45 So you need energy in order
to get neurons to fire.
1759.51 And it is pH dependent.
1761.27 It depends on the conditions
1763.56 or the environment within the
brain being of a certain pH
1766.5 or acidity.
1767.58 pH is about how acid or how
basic the environment is?
1772.05 And we will talk a little
bit about pH in simple terms
1774.28 so you can understand.
1775.113 So nerves need salt, they need potassium.
1777.82 And it turns out they need magnesium
1779.72 and you need glucose and carbohydrates
1782.12 in order to power those neurons,
1783.41 unless you are running on ketones.
1786.4 And to run on ketones,
1787.86 you have to make sure that
you're fully keto adapted.
1790.95 I will talk about adding in
ketones on top of carbohydrate
1794.56 at the end of the episode.
1796.34 Okay, so that's how nerves work.
1797.98 You need carbohydrate,
1799.03 you need sodium, potassium and magnesium
1800.92 in order to drive the brain.
1804.23 Muscle.
1805.063 Muscle is going to engage
in generating energy first
1808.83 by using this phosphocreatine system.
1811.51 High bouts of effort
really intense effort,
1814.08 short-lived seconds to minutes,
1816.51 but probably more like seconds
1817.7 is going to be this phosphate
creating literally a fuel source
1820.12 in the muscle that you're going to burn,
1821.73 just like you would logs on a fire.
1824.83 And glycogen which is stored
carbohydrate in the muscle,
1828.32 that also can be burned
just like logs on a fire
1830.73 to generate energy.
1831.7 So let me make this crystal clear.
1833.28 If you move your wrist
towards your shoulder
1835.2 and contract your bicep really hard,
1837.33 muscle fibers are burning
up their own carbohydrate.
1839.98 They're converting that into ATP
1841.8 in order to generate that energy.
1844.04 Okay?
1845.03 And pH is important and
temperature is important.
1850.51 In the episode on supercharge
your physical performance,
1853.82 I talked all about how by
using cooling specifically
1857.78 of the palms or the bottoms of the feet
1859.73 or the cheeks of the face
using particular methods,
1862.7 you can adjust the temperature
of the body and of muscle
1867.78 in a way that allows you to do more work,
1870.13 to do more reps, to run further,
1872.47 to keep going and to persist.
1874.78 And that's because if temperature
is too low or too high,
1880.15 then ATP is not going to be available
1884.01 because of this whole thing
1884.843 called the pyruvate kinase pathway
1886.7 and the temperature
dependence of pyruvate kinase.
1888.68 Check out that episode if you
want to learn more about that.
1890.52 But temperature is important
and pH is also important.
1893.6 So we got nerve, muscle,
1894.72 and then there's stuff in our blood
1896.55 that's available as an energy source.
1898.85 And in blood, we got glucose.
1900.41 So literally blood sugar
that's floating around.
1902.24 So let's say you have
fasted for three days,
1904.47 your blood glucose is
going to be very low.
1906.48 So that's not going to
be a great fuel source,
1908.82 but you will start to liberate fats
1910.72 from your adipose tissue from your fat.
1913.35 Fatty acids will start to
mobilize into the bloodstream
1915.81 and you can burn those for energy.
1918.9 And oxygen in your blood when
you inhale, [inhales deeply]
1921.68 you're bringing oxygen into your blood.
1923.19 So these are all fuel
sources in your neurons,
1925.41 in your muscle, in your blood,
1927.33 in your various tissues that
are providing the opportunity
1934.825 to induce effort whether
or not it's a run or swim
1937.53 or writing or talking.
1939.29 Now, there are some other
factors that are important
1942.89 and those are the heart
which is going to move blood.
1946.13 So the more that the heart
can move blood and oxygen,
1950.03 well, the more fuel that's
going to be available for you
1954.16 to engage in muscular
effort and thinking effort.
1958.23 So your heart vitally important
to your muscles ability
1961.67 to work and your brain's ability to work.
1963.66 And as I've mentioned, oxygen a few times,
1966.69 it should be obvious then that
the lungs are very important.
1969.04 You need to bring oxygen in,
1970.71 and distribute it to all these tissues,
1972.7 because oxygen is critical
for the conversion
1975.321 of carbohydrates and
the conversion of fats.
1980.13 And we could get into the discussion about
1982.62 whether or not oxygen is important
for ketogenic metabolism,
1985.54 but you need oxygen there,
1986.96 you need to breathe and you
need to breathe properly.
1989.69 So I just covered what would
normally be about four lectures
1994.33 of energy consumption
and energy utilization.
1996.99 I didn't go into much detail at all.
1998.35 But what I want you to imagine is that,
2001.47 you've got these different cell types.
2003.42 You've got neurons, you've got muscle,
2005.62 they need to collaborate
in order to generate effort
2008.48 or to make the decision to do something
2010.21 or to think hard or to
run hard or to run far.
2013.11 And then you've got fuel
sources both in the neurons,
2017.29 in the muscle, in your blood,
2020.29 and then the heart and
lungs are going to help
2022.99 distribute the oxygen and those fuels.
2026.74 And of course you have
that little energy pack
2028.57 that we call the liver that
will allow you to pull out
2032.14 a little more carbohydrate
if you need it for work.
2035.34 Okay?
2036.173 So that's as much as I want to
cover about energy consumption,
2039.21 because that's a lot.
2040.9 But what it tells you is that when you eat
2043.06 and you use food as a fuel source,
2045.05 that food can be broken down
2047.89 and you can immediately burn the glucose
2050.07 that's in your bloodstream,
2050.94 or you can rely on some of
the stored fuel in your liver,
2053.78 or you can rely on stored
fuel in the muscle,
2056.01 so-called glycogen.
2057.4 And there are a lot of different ways
2059.1 that we can generate ATP.
2060.99 So when we ask the question,
2062.25 what's limiting for performance?
2065.35 What is going to allow us to endure,
2068.32 to engage in effort and
endure long bouts of effort
2071.94 or even moderately long bouts of effort?
2074.58 We need to ask which of those things,
2076.6 nerve, muscle, blood, heart
and lungs is limiting?
2080.66 Or put differently,
2081.86 we ask, what should we be
doing with our neurons?
2084.08 What should we be doing with our muscles?
2085.42 What should we be doing with our blood?
2087.07 What should we be doing with our heart
2088.23 and what should we be doing with our lungs
2090.35 that's going to allow
us to build endurance
2093.97 for mental and physical work
2096.02 and to be able to go longer,
further with more intensity?
2102.97 That's the real question?
2103.99 How can we do more work?
2106.13 And the way we do that is with energy,
2108.03 and the way to get energy to it,
2109.25 is to buy those five things.
2110.55 And so now we're going to talk about,
2112.29 how you can actually build
different types of endurance?
2116.49 And what that does at
the level of your blood,
2119.81 your heart, your muscles and your neurons.
2121.54 So we're going to skip back and
forth between protocols, tools
2125.5 and the underlying science.
2126.93 So rather than heavy stack
the science at the front end
2129.57 and then just give you
all the tools at the end,
2131.27 we're going to talk about the protocols,
2134.81 the four kinds of endurance
and how to achieve them?
2137.25 And we are going to talk
about the underlying science
2139.58 as we move through that.
2141.57 If you would like a lot
of detailed science,
2144.22 I encourage you to check out a review
2146.23 that we've linked in the show notes.
2148.84 And the review is called
adaptations to endurance
2151.86 and strength training.
2153.16 This is a review article with
many excellent citations.
2156.56 It's from Cold Spring Harbor
Perspectives in Medicine.
2159.31 The Cold Spring Harbor Press
2160.35 is an excellent scientific press.
2162.37 Spent the last 21 years doing
summers at Cold Spring Harbor
2165.87 teaching neuroscience,
2167.26 but Cold Spring Harbor is
involved in all sorts of themes
2170.24 and topics related to
neuroscience and medicine.
2174.28 This review by Hughes L.Ellefson.
2178.63 Ellefson that's the name.
2179.78 Ellefson and Barr, B-A-A-R.
2182.18 Adaptations through endurance
and strength training
2184.24 is rich with citations.
2186.09 It can be downloaded as a complete PDF.
2188.44 There's no paywall and we will link to it.
2190.88 And it gets really deep into
all the signaling cascades,
2195.02 the genetic changes within muscle
2197.272 with high intensity interval training,
2199.28 short-term, super high intensity
training, weight training.
2203.86 So if you're a real nerd for this stuff
2206.42 and you want to get right
down into how PGC-1alpha,
2209.045 P53 and PH20 change the
adaptation features of muscle
2214.04 and gene regulation,
2215.0 that is definitely the review for you.
2216.75 If you're like most people,
2218.13 and you're not really interested
in that level of detail,
2220.81 no reason to pick up the review,
2222.18 unless you just want to check out
2223.29 some of the figures and pictures.
2225.55 But I do want to offer that as a resource
2227.83 it's been in addition to
discussions with Dr. Andy Galpin,
2231.41 it's been a primary
resource for the content
2234.1 of this episode.
2235.71 So let's talk about the
four kinds of endurance
2238.42 and how to achieve those?
2240.66 I do believe that everybody
should have some sort
2243.64 of endurance practice,
regular endurance practice.
2247.41 It's clear that it's vital for
the functioning of the body
2250.28 and the mind.
2251.5 And there are clear longevity benefits.
2255.224 There are a lot of
reasons why that's true,
2258.13 but the main one is that if we
have good energy utilization
2264.66 in our musculature and in our blood,
2268.34 in our vascular system and
in our oxygenating system,
2272.8 our lungs, the so-called
cardiovascular system,
2275.23 respiratory system and musculature.
2277.71 The body and brain function much better.
2280.08 There are so many papers now,
so much data to support that.
2284.17 So I do believe everyone
should either try to maintain
2287.89 the muscle that they have,
2289.6 provided they've already
gone through puberty
2291.27 and development.
2292.69 And they should be engaged in
regular endurance exercise.
2296.79 Now, for many people, they
think endurance exercise.
2299.66 That means what?
2301.05 A hour long run or I got
to get on the StairMaster
2304.4 or I have to treadmill for
hours on end each week.
2307.33 And it turns out that's not the case.
2308.69 There are four kinds of endurance,
2310.35 and you can train specifically
for any one of those,
2313.56 and you can vary your training.
2315.09 So let's talk about those
four kinds of endurance.
2317.4 These are very interesting
2318.52 and they each have very
different protocols
2321.79 that you use in order to
build and maximize them.
2325.48 And now you'll understand
what fuel sources they use
2329.44 in order to build that
thing we call endurance.
2331.69 So first of all, we
have muscular endurance.
2335.49 Muscular endurance is the
ability for our muscles
2340.93 to perform work over time,
2344.25 and our failure to continue
to be able to perform
2348.3 that work is going to be
due to muscular fatigue,
2352.41 not to cardiovascular fatigue.
2355.13 So not because we're breathing too hard
2356.85 or we can't get enough
blood to the muscles
2359.16 or because we quit mentally,
2361.23 but because the muscles
themselves give out.
2364.8 Okay?
2365.633 One good example of this would be,
2368.22 if you had to pick up a stone in the yard
2372.69 and that stone is not
extremely heavy for you,
2376.41 and you needed to do that
anywhere from 50 to a 100 times,
2380.9 and you were picking it
up and putting it down
2382.57 and picking it up and putting it down
2383.79 and picking up and putting it down.
2385.48 At some point, your muscles will fatigue.
2388.59 They will fail to endure.
2390.77 Muscular endurance is incredibly useful
2393.87 for a variety of physical pursuits.
2396.798 And we will talk about the mental pursuits
2398.85 that it supports as well.
2400.57 In terms of physical pursuits,
2402.76 the ability for a given muscle
to perform repeated work
2406.92 is going to improve your golf swing.
2409.36 It's going to improve your tennis swing.
2411.72 It's going to improve your posture,
2413.57 your ability to dance,
2414.84 your ability to repeatedly
engage in an activity
2418.75 that requires effort in a
way that's very different
2423.32 from the kind of endurance
that you will build simply
2425.84 by increasing your cardiovascular fitness,
2428.27 your ability to generate
kind of easy repetition.
2431.28 So let's talk about muscular
endurance and what it is?
2433.98 Muscular endurance is
going to be something
2436.77 that you can perform for
anywhere from 12 to 25,
2442.14 or even up to 100 repetitions.
2444.76 And that's actually how if you like
2446.74 you would train muscular endurance.
2448.76 And I'll give the specific
protocol in a few moments.
2451.92 So a good example is push-ups, right?
2454.95 If you were to get on the
floor and start doing push-ups,
2459.66 even if you're somebody who
has to do knees down push-ups,
2462.84 and you're doing your push-ups,
2464.18 eventually you won't be
able to do any more push-ups
2466.57 and that's not going to be
because you couldn't get enough
2470.32 oxygen into your system,
2472.14 or your heart wasn't pumping enough blood.
2474.99 It's going to be because the muscles fail.
2477.41 That's why.
2478.43 So if you want to be
able to do more push-ups
2480.54 or even more pull-ups.
2482.18 Muscular endurance is
really what it's about.
2485.14 It's actually no coincidence
that a lot of military bootcamp
2488.47 style training is not done with weights,
2490.76 it's done with things
like push-ups, pull-ups,
2492.69 sit-ups and running.
2494.03 Because what they're really
building is muscular endurance.
2496.24 The ability to perform
work repeatedly over time
2499.57 for a given set of muscles and neurons.
2502.37 So what's a good protocol
to build muscular endurance.
2504.57 Let's just give that to you now
2505.56 and explain some of the
underlying science as it follows.
2510.64 So a really good muscular
endurance training protocol
2514.76 according to the scientific
literature would be,
2516.76 three to five sets of anywhere
from 12 to 100 repetitions.
2522.48 That's a huge range.
2524.17 Now, 12 to 25 repetitions is
going to be more reasonable
2530.12 for most people.
2531.62 And the rest periods
are going to be anywhere
2534.24 from 30 to 180 seconds of rest.
2537.48 So anywhere from half a minute
to three minutes of rest.
2539.92 So this might be five sets of push-ups,
2542.98 done getting your maximum push-ups
2544.42 although for some people
that might be zero
2546.53 and you have to do it knees down.
2547.87 For some people it might be 10 push-ups,
2549.39 for some people might be 25,
2550.54 but you could go all the way up to 100.
2552.2 Rest anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds,
2555.06 and then do your next set
2556.5 for a total of three to five sets.
2558.42 So it doesn't actually
sound like a ton of work.
2560.73 The other thing you could do
is something like a plank.
2563.07 A plank position is actually a way
2566.53 to build muscular endurance, not strength.
2570.945 Okay?
2571.778 I'm sure it could be
used to develop strength,
2573.69 but it's really about muscular endurance.
2575.41 So you would do three
to five sets of planks.
2577.98 Those planks would probably even
2579.66 because you're not doing repetitions,
2580.85 it's an isometric hold as we say,
2582.58 as kind of static hold or a wall sit
2585.0 would be another example.
2586.23 And you would do that probably
for a minute or two minutes,
2590.1 take some rest of anywhere
from 30, 60, or 180 seconds,
2593.8 and then repeat.
2595.02 So things like pushing a sled, push-ups,
2597.602 isometric planks, even pull-ups,
2601.0 those will all work.
2603.49 And as with others forms of training,
2606.98 you would want to do this,
2608.25 until you approach
failure or actually fail
2611.45 and where you're unable to
perform another repetition
2614.11 that would mark the end of a set.
2616.74 The one critical feature of
building muscular endurance
2620.06 is that it has no major east
centric loading component.
2624.94 Now, I haven't talked much about eccentric
2627.99 and concentric loading.
2629.81 But concentric loading is
when you are shortening
2633.01 the muscle typically or lifting a weight.
2636.03 And east centric movements
2637.34 are when you are lengthening
a muscle typically
2639.89 or lowering a weight.
2641.68 So if you do a pull up and
you get your chin over the bar
2644.81 or a chin up, that's the
concentric portion of the effort,
2648.22 and then as you lower yourself,
2649.33 that's the eccentric portion.
2651.397 Eccentric portion of resistance
training of any kind,
2655.27 whether or not it's for
endurance or for strength
2657.29 is one of the major causes of soreness.
2660.2 Some people will be more
susceptible to this,
2663.71 excuse me than others,
2665.16 but it does create more
damage in muscle fibers.
2668.96 Muscular endurance and
building muscular endurance
2671.84 should not include any movements
2673.61 that include major eccentric loads.
2676.41 So if you're going to do push-ups,
2678.93 it doesn't mean that you want to drop,
2680.34 you know, smash your chest into the floor.
2682.94 And by the way your chest
should touch the ground
2684.62 on every push-up.
2686.01 That's a real push-up.
2687.3 Okay?
2688.133 It's not about breaking
90 with the elbows,
2689.7 it's about pushing down until
your chest touch the floor
2692.22 and straightening out.
2693.053 That's a proper push-up.
2694.35 And a pull-up is where you pull
up your chin above the bar.
2697.73 Neither of those should
include a slow eccentric
2700.73 or lowering component.
2702.17 If you are using those to
train muscular endurance
2705.05 the three to five sets of 12 to 25
2707.417 and maybe even up to 100 repetitions
2709.76 with 3,280 seconds of rest in between.
2714.09 That means that jumping also
is going to be a very poor tool
2718.79 for building muscular endurance,
2721.52 because jumping has a slowing
down component as you land.
2725.46 So things like plyometrics or agility work
2728.34 where you're moving from side to side,
2729.73 and you're decelerating,
2730.79 you're slowing yourself down a lot,
2732.53 not going to be good
for muscular endurance.
2734.66 Terrific for cardiovascular training
2737.04 and conditioning of other
kinds and skill training
2739.13 and agility and all that.
2740.68 But if you want to build
muscular endurance,
2743.64 you want to make your muscles
able to do more work for longer.
2747.96 It's going to be this three to five sets
2749.86 of 12 to 100 reps,
2751.979 30 to 180 seconds of
mainly concentric movement.
2756.22 Okay?
2757.053 Not a slow lowering phase
or a heavy lowering phase.
2762.0 So that might be kettlebell
swings and things of that sort.
2765.61 Isometrics, as I mentioned,
things like planks
2767.36 and wall sets will work.
2768.94 Now, what's interesting
about this is that,
2771.4 it doesn't seem at all
like what people normally
2774.26 think of as endurance.
2775.6 And yet it's been shown in nice, quality
2778.97 peer-reviewed studies,
2780.07 several of which are cited in the review
2781.84 I mentioned earlier,
2783.23 that muscular endurance
can improve our ability
2787.67 to engage in long bouts of
what we call long duration,
2791.63 low-intensity endurance work.
2793.61 So this can support long runs.
2795.62 It can support long swims.
2797.26 And it can build also...
2800.09 It can build postural strength
and endurance simultaneously
2805.32 and that's mainly accomplished
through isometrical.
2808.12 So things like planks
are actually quite good
2811.77 for building endurance of
the spinal erector muscles
2814.41 that provide posture of
the abdominal muscles
2817.57 that are helpful for
posture for being upright
2820.25 for the upper neck muscles
and things of that sort.
2823.47 These days everyone
seems to have texts neck.
2825.52 Everyone is basically staring
at their toes all the time
2827.79 as a default towards their toes.
2829.61 So isometric holds can be very good
2831.59 for building muscular endurance.
2833.78 You can spot people including yourself,
2836.89 perhaps with poor muscular
endurance in the postural muscles
2840.96 because anytime they stop moving,
2842.69 they have to lean against a wall
2844.38 or their hip will move to one side,
2846.61 or they're always leaned to one side.
2848.33 I am guilty of this too.
2849.9 Some of you have actually pointed out.
2851.6 I like to think out of concern
2853.41 that I often am rubbing my lower back.
2856.28 And indeed I have some
asymmetries of my postural muscles
2859.04 some of which are probably genetic
2860.45 and some of which are probably
just from excessive work
2863.322 or something of that sort
2864.53 that have my right shoulder
set lower than my left
2867.01 and things of that sort.
2868.0 If I wanted to improve those,
2869.71 I could improve those by
really focusing on symmetry
2872.18 and isometric.
2873.2 Symmetry meaning holding my
hands at equivalent positions
2876.24 in planks and doing isometric holds
2879.31 for building muscular endurance
of the postural muscles.
2883.11 But this can also be done with,
2884.75 as I mentioned, kettlebell
swings for the lower back
2886.8 and legs and posterior chain.
2888.55 So there are a number
of different exercises
2889.87 you could do this with,
2890.703 but it should be compound
exercises mainly.
2894.24 It's rare for people to do
this kind of muscular endurance
2897.4 work specifically for things
like bicep curls or triceps.
2901.66 And there aren't many activities
2903.18 that really rely on
isolation of those muscles
2905.247 and repeatedly, right?
2906.69 It's hard...
2907.523 I'm sure there are some out there,
2908.356 but it's kind of hard to imagine.
2910.22 So you can do this with isometrics,
2912.6 you can do this with more standard
2914.9 non-isometric type movements,
2916.18 but make sure there isn't
a strong eccentric load.
2918.73 So now let's talk about
the science briefly
2920.54 of why this works?
2922.49 Well, that takes us back to
this issue of fuel utilization
2926.97 and what fails?
2928.67 So if we would say, okay,
let's say you do a plank
2932.68 and you're planking for,
2934.48 you know, maybe you're
able to plank for a minute
2936.37 or two minutes or three minutes.
2938.36 At some point you will fail.
2940.02 You're not going to fail
because the heart gives out.
2942.34 You're not going to fail because
you can't get enough oxygen
2945.67 because you can breathe
while you're doing that.
2947.58 You're going to fail because
of local muscular failure.
2950.18 Which means that as you do,
2951.78 if you choose to do this
protocol of three to five sets,
2955.26 et cetera, et cetera, to
build muscular endurance,
2958.75 mainly what you are going to be building
2961.76 is you're going to be building the ability
2964.28 of your mitochondria to use oxygen
2967.45 to generate energy locally.
2969.27 And that is something called
mitochondrial respiration.
2972.59 Respiration because of
the involvement of oxygen.
2976.27 And it's also going to
be increasing the extent
2981.18 to which the neurons control the muscles
2984.7 and provide a stimulus for
the muscles to contract.
2988.37 But this is independent
of power and strength.
2991.3 Okay?
2992.133 So even though the low sets
like three to five sets
2995.37 and the fact that you're doing repetitions
2997.35 and you're going to failure,
2999.1 even though it seems to
resemble power and strength
3002.077 and hypertrophy type training,
it is distinctly different.
3005.02 It's not going to generate
strength, hypertrophy and power.
3008.26 It's going to mainly create
this ability to endure
3011.69 to continually contract muscles
3013.76 or repeatedly contract muscles.
3015.98 Okay?
3016.813 Continually if you're
using isometric holds,
3019.2 repeatedly, excuse me,
3020.22 if you're using repetition type exercise
3023.52 where there's a contraction
and an extension the muscle
3027.72 essentially concentric
and an eccentric portion.
3030.84 But remember that you want the
eccentric portion to be light
3034.91 and relatively fast,
3036.35 not so fast that you injure yourself,
3037.66 but certainly not
deliberately slowed down.
3040.77 It was recommended, I
should say by Andy Galpin
3046.2 that you not use Olympic lifts for this,
3048.86 because once you get past
eight or 12 or 25 repetitions,
3053.07 especially form on those
Olympic lifts is key
3056.24 for not getting injured.
3058.02 And while some people can
perform those sorts of of lifts
3061.06 likes snatches and deadlifts
and cleans and jerks
3063.81 and overhead presses,
3065.4 probably not a great idea if
the goal is to push the body
3070.14 to points of fatigue,
3071.22 because you do open yourself up to injury,
3072.96 unless you're very skilled at doing that,
3074.54 or you have a really good coach
3075.61 who can help you guide
through those lifts.
3077.93 So that's one form of endurance
3079.81 which is muscular endurance.
3080.643 And it's mainly going to
rely on neural energy.
3084.23 So nerves and muscle.
3086.93 And it's not going to rely quite so much
3088.95 on what's available in your
blood, your heart or your lungs.
3092.64 So now let's talk about the
other extreme of endurance
3095.68 which is long duration endurance.
3098.32 This is the type that
people typically think about
3100.731 when they think about endurance.
3103.01 You're talking about a
long run, a long swim,
3106.63 a long bike ride.
3107.95 Well, how long we'll
anywhere from 12 minutes
3111.96 to several hours or
maybe even an entire day,
3115.06 maybe eight or nine hours of
hiking or running or biking.
3118.54 Some people are actually doing those kinds
3119.77 of really long events
marathons, for instance.
3122.71 So anything longer than 12 minutes.
3125.43 And this type of work
builds on fuel utilization
3130.6 in the muscles,
3132.39 it builds on the activity
of neurons in the brain
3135.73 that are involved in what we call
3137.25 central pattern generators.
3138.74 We talked about this in a previous episode
3141.15 or several previous episodes.
3142.57 These are groups of
neurons that allow our body
3144.78 to engage in regular rhythmic effort
3147.37 without having to think
about the movement too much.
3149.73 So running and stepping or swimming
3151.77 if you already know how to swim,
3152.99 or peddling on a bike or
walking upstairs and hiking,
3156.04 you're not thinking about
right, left, right, left.
3158.79 It's all carried out by
central pattern generators.
3162.14 This is going to be at
less than a hundred percent
3165.5 of your maximum oxygen uptake,
3167.85 your VO2 max, I'll talk
about what VO2 max is.
3170.55 But I just want to give a
sense of what the protocol is,
3172.74 and the underlying science.
3174.78 How many sets?
3176.63 One.
3177.51 Long duration effort is one
set of 12 minutes or longer.
3182.85 So you're not counting repetitions.
3184.18 I sure hope that if you're
going out on a 30 minute run
3186.35 or even a 15 minute run,
3187.3 that you're not counting steps,
3190.18 that you're not counting pedal strokes,
3191.81 that you're not on the rower
counting poles on the rower.
3195.69 I suppose you could,
3196.68 but I think that would be pretty dreadful.
3198.83 Seems like a poor utilization
of cognitive brain space.
3202.5 You're getting into
regular repeated effort
3205.97 and your ability to continue that effort
3209.72 is going to be dependent
mainly on the efficiency
3212.92 of the movement on your
ability to strike a balance
3216.39 between the movement itself,
3220.06 the generation of the muscular
movements that are required,
3223.79 and fuel utilization across
the different sources
3227.94 of nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs.
3230.27 So let's ask the question.
3231.24 Why would you fail on a long run?
3233.16 Why would you quit?
3234.54 Well, as you set out on that long run,
3237.14 assuming you have some
glycogen in your liver
3238.9 and in your muscles, you're
going to use that energy first,
3241.4 even if it's very low intensity.
3242.91 I guess we're not talking about sprinting,
3244.46 we're talking about heading out the door
3246.79 or starting off on a marathon.
3249.31 You're starting to assuming
you have some conditioning
3251.39 or even if you don't,
3252.223 you're going to burn carbohydrate.
3253.64 You're going to burn
glucose in the bloodstream,
3255.33 you're going to burn carbohydrate
as those muscles contract.
3257.72 Those what we call slow twitch muscles.
3259.1 They're contracting,
3259.933 they start burning up fuel to make ATP
3262.15 to continue to contract.
3265.08 Your mind is going to
use more or less energy
3269.43 depending on how much willpower,
3272.04 how much of a fight you have
to get into with yourself
3274.64 in order to generate the effort.
3276.16 I really want to underscore this.
3277.74 If you're somebody that's thinking,
3278.85 maybe I go for the run,
3279.683 maybe I don't go for the run.
3280.63 I'll do it at two o'clock.
3281.59 Okay, 2:05.
3282.423 No, I only want to go on the half hour
3283.97 or maybe on the main hour.
3285.05 And you're going through all that.
3286.51 Guess what?
3287.343 You're burning up useful energy
3289.9 that you could use either
for the run, for example,
3293.65 or for something else.
3295.06 When we think about something hard,
3296.56 when we ruminate,
3298.3 when we perseverate on
an idea or on a decision,
3302.83 we are burning neural
energy and neural energy
3305.81 is glucose and epinephrin
and all the things
3309.02 we talked about before.
3310.47 So willpower in part is the ability
3314.76 to devote resources to things
3317.57 and part of that is making decisions
3319.48 to just either do it or not do it.
3321.44 I'm not of the just do it mindset.
3323.41 I think there's a right
time and a place to train.
3325.77 But I also think that it is not good.
3329.2 In other words, it utilizes
excessive resources
3332.43 to churn over decisions excessively,
3335.45 and you probably burn
as much cognitive energy
3339.33 deciding about whether or not
to do a given training or not
3342.19 as you do in the actual training.
3345.31 Okay?
3346.143 So we'll talk more about how
this long duration effort
3348.01 can relate to mental performance,
3349.74 but the long duration
effort should be one set,
3352.2 12 minutes or longer.
3353.63 It could go for 30 minutes
or 60 minutes or an hour.
3356.65 We'll talk about programming
later in the episode.
3359.1 This is going to be less
than a hundred percent
3360.75 of your maximum oxygen uptake.
3363.51 Your heart rate is not going
to be through the ceiling
3365.39 or maxed out.
3366.92 But it's all about efficiency of movement.
3369.61 That's what you're building.
3371.03 When you go out for a
run that's 30 minutes,
3372.95 you are building the capacity
to repeat that performance.
3378.11 The next time, while being more efficient
3380.92 actually burning less fuel.
3383.42 And that might seem a
little bit counterintuitive,
3385.77 but every time you do that run,
3388.39 what you're doing is you're building up
3390.27 mitochondrial density.
3392.13 It's not so much about
mitochondrial oxidation
3395.55 and respiration.
3396.93 You're building up mitochondrial density.
3399.27 You're actually increasing
the amount of ATP
3401.96 that you can create for
a given about of effort.
3405.18 You're becoming more efficient.
3407.5 Okay?
3408.333 You're burning less fuel
overall doing the same thing.
3411.99 That's really what
these long slow distance
3414.14 or long bouts of effort
are really all about.
3416.61 Now, why do this long duration effort?
3418.67 Why would you want to do it?
3419.86 Why is it good for you?
3420.87 Well, it does something very important
3424.53 which is that it builds the
capillary beds within muscles.
3428.47 So let's talk a little
bit about vasculature.
3430.33 We haven't done this too much yet,
3433.1 but if you have seen the episode
3435.58 on supercharging performance.
3436.94 We talked about these AVAs
arteriovenous anastomosis
3441.62 where blood moves from
arteries directly into veins,
3446.75 but that's unusual,
3448.7 that only takes place in
the so-called glabrous skin
3453.88 of the palms, the face and
the bottoms of the feet.
3456.56 Typically, for most all
other areas of the body
3460.61 what happens is,
3462.21 arteries bring blood to a
given tissue like a muscle,
3466.45 and veins return that
blood back to the heart.
3470.77 There are exceptions, but in general.
3472.56 And in between arteries and
veins are these little tiny
3476.1 what are called capillary
beds or microcapillaries.
3478.76 So these are tiny little avenues,
3480.65 like little tiny streams and estuaries
3482.94 between the bigger arteries and veins.
3485.49 Now, those are actually
contained within muscle.
3490.16 And what's amazing is
that you can increase
3492.64 the number of them.
3493.76 You can literally build new capillaries.
3495.7 You can create new little
streams within your muscles
3499.6 and the type of long duration effort
3501.88 that I was talking about
before to 12 minutes or more
3504.24 of steady effort is very
useful for doing that,
3509.2 and is very useful for
increasing the mitochondria,
3512.76 the energy producing
elements of the cells,
3515.76 the actual muscle cells.
3517.91 And the reason is when
blood arrives to muscles
3522.96 it has oxygen.
3524.56 The muscles are going to
use some of that oxygen.
3526.61 And then some of the deoxygenated blood
3528.54 is going to be sent back to
the heart and to the lungs.
3531.94 Now, the more capillaries that
you build into those muscles,
3535.99 the more oxygen available
to those muscles.
3539.85 I don't want to get too much
into the physics of fluid flow.
3542.99 But basically it's the
difference between taking a hose
3545.8 and sticking it into some
dirt just directly like
3549.63 and turning on the faucet at a given rate,
3552.55 the spigot rather,
3554.1 or having a bunch of little hoses
3556.08 like a sprinkler system that go out
3557.65 and irrigate the whole yard.
3559.29 The irrigation is equivalent
to this capillary bed system.
3562.65 And it's very good at using
energy sources within blood.
3567.46 So the simple way to think about this is,
3569.84 when you go out for a run,
3571.11 let's say it's the first
run you've done for a while,
3572.81 and you out for 12 or 15 minutes
3574.68 and somewhere right around 20 minutes
3576.327 you're like, that's it.
3577.46 I just can't continue.
3578.99 Well, when you come back the
next time to do that run,
3582.18 you've built endurance largely
3586.03 because you've built these capillary beds.
3588.28 You've expanded these little streams
3590.3 in which blood can deliver
oxygen to the muscles.
3592.97 And so it's going to feel
relatively straightforward
3595.73 to either go a little bit
quicker for the same duration,
3598.81 the same distance.
3599.99 Or to extend that run for
another five to 10 minutes.
3604.25 So this long duration work,
3606.17 unlike muscular endurance like planks
3608.33 and everything that we
were talking about before
3610.62 is really about building
the capillary systems
3613.36 and the mitochondria,
3614.75 the energy utilization systems
3616.69 within the muscles themselves.
3619.11 And that's very important to understand.
3621.22 It's distinctly different
than say building the neurons
3624.15 that fire the muscles.
3625.26 The neurons are already there,
3626.52 they're going to fire
those muscles just fine.
3628.44 In fact, if your life depended on it,
3630.39 today you could probably run a marathon.
3632.38 You'd probably get injured,
3633.43 it would be very psychologically
and physically painful.
3635.6 I don't recommend you do that
unless you're trained for it.
3637.99 But if you were to train properly for it,
3639.94 if you were to do long
duration bouts of effort
3642.68 once or twice a week or three times a week
3645.01 pretty soon it would become easy,
3646.46 because you're building
these vascular micro beds
3649.13 or microvascular beds as they're called.
3651.62 Okay?
3652.453 So you're able to bring
more energy to the muscles
3654.7 and they're able to utilize more energy.
3656.98 So that's long duration.
3658.63 So we've got muscular endurance
3659.7 and we've got long duration endurance.
3661.43 And then there are two kinds in between
3664.38 that in recent years have
gotten a lot of attention
3667.5 and excitement,
3668.61 but most people are not distinguishing
3670.28 between these two kinds of endurance.
3673.5 And that's a shame because
in failing to distinguish
3677.06 between the two kinds of what we call
3678.54 high-intensity training,
3680.27 sometimes called high
intensity interval training.
3683.3 Most people, perhaps you,
3685.38 are not getting nearly as much physical
3687.96 and mental benefit out of
high intensity training
3691.14 as you could.
3692.13 So I want to talk about the two kinds
3693.73 of high-intensity interval training,
3696.06 and what each of them does
for your brain and body,
3698.88 and what sorts of adaptations they cause?
3701.57 Because in doing that,
3702.99 you can really start to build
up specific energy systems
3706.83 in your brain and body in
ways that are best serve you
3709.97 for your cognitive work.
3712.58 And for other sorts of things
like strength and speed
3715.9 or hypertrophy or for running
marathons for that matter.
3719.63 So there are two kinds of
high intensity training
3722.394 for endurance.
3723.63 Sometimes called high-intensity
interval training.
3727.25 One, is anaerobic, so-called
an aerobic endurance,
3731.41 so no oxygen.
3732.52 And the other is aerobic endurance.
3734.64 Both of which qualify as HIIT,
3737.89 high intensity interval training.
3739.15 So let's talk about
anaerobic endurance first.
3742.73 Anaerobic endurance from
a protocol perspective
3746.63 is going to be three to 12 sets.
3751.088 Okay?
3752.32 And these records and I'll talk about
3754.765 what the repetitions are,
3757.16 are going to be performed
at whatever speed allows you
3761.05 to complete the work in good, safe form.
3764.44 Okay?
3765.273 So it could be fast, it could be slow
3766.55 as the work continues,
3768.53 your repetitions may slow down,
3770.47 or it may speed up.
3771.81 Chances are it's going to slow down.
3773.01 So what does this work?
3774.79 What are the sets look like?
3776.21 Remember long slow distance is one set.
3779.06 Muscular endurance is three to five sets.
3781.05 High-intensity anaerobic endurance
3783.14 is going to be somewhere
between three and 12 sets.
3787.29 And it's going to have
a ratio of work to rest
3791.58 of anywhere from three
to one to one to five.
3795.91 Okay?
3796.743 So what would a three to
one ratio set look like?
3800.9 Well, it's going to be 30
seconds of hard pedaling
3804.19 on the bike, for instance,
or running or on the rower.
3808.69 These are just examples.
3809.83 It could be in the pool, swimming.
3811.26 It could be any number
of things or air squats,
3813.35 or weighted squats if you will
provided you can manage that.
3818.51 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.
3821.45 That's a very brief rest.
3823.21 So three to one is just a good example
3825.0 would be 30 seconds on 10 seconds off.
3828.92 The opposite extreme on
that ratio be one to five.
3832.49 So 20 seconds on a hundred seconds off.
3835.36 So you do the work for 20 seconds
3837.49 then you rest a hundred seconds.
3839.28 Now, what's the difference?
3840.43 What should you do three one ratio?
3843.66 So 30 seconds on 10 seconds off,
3846.0 or should you do one to five,
3848.04 20 seconds on to 100 seconds off?
3850.28 Well, that will depend on
whether or not the quality
3854.1 of the movement is important to you.
3856.72 So let's just take a look
at the three to one ratio.
3859.28 So in the three to one ratio,
3861.55 if you're going to do 30
seconds of hard peddling
3864.71 on a bike followed by 10 seconds.
3866.22 So maybe one of these what
they call assault bikes,
3868.63 and then you stop for 10
seconds and then repeat,
3871.11 chances are you will
be able to do one, two,
3876.32 three, four, maybe even
as many as 12 sets,
3879.19 if you're really in good condition
3881.28 that you'll be able to do all those
3882.48 because pedaling on the bike
doesn't require a ton of skill.
3885.31 And if you do it incorrectly,
3887.95 if your elbow flares out
a little bit or something,
3889.83 it's very unlikely that you'll get injured
3891.55 unless it's really extreme.
3893.44 Okay?
3894.273 But the same movement done for
instance, with kettlebells.
3897.23 So 30 seconds on 10 seconds off.
3900.46 The first set will
probably be in good form.
3902.21 The second one will be
in pretty good form,
3903.96 but let's say you're getting
to the fifth and sixth set
3905.68 and you're going 30
seconds on 10 seconds off
3907.77 chances are the quality
of your repetitions
3910.61 will degrade significantly.
3911.93 And you increase the probability
3913.26 that you're going to get injured,
3915.05 or that you're going
to damage in some way,
3918.07 or that you can't complete the movement
3920.1 or that some smaller muscles
like your grip muscles
3922.35 might give out.
3923.76 Okay?
3924.593 So the quality of repetitions
is going to drop considerably
3928.43 with the three to one approach.
3930.745 If you're just doing it for effort.
3932.63 And we'll talk about what
this builds in your system
3934.67 in a moment, that's fine.
3936.27 But for most people, if
quality of form is important,
3941.34 so maybe this is using weights,
3943.43 maybe you're doing squats.
3944.7 You're going to do 20 seconds
on and 100 seconds of rest.
3947.57 Maybe it's even a barbell loaded squat,
3949.32 maybe you're doing kettlebells,
3950.85 maybe you've got some
other resistance there
3953.96 that's allowing you to do this.
3955.72 What you'll find is that the longer rest,
3957.63 even though it's 20
seconds of intense effort,
3960.32 followed by a longer rest
of about a hundred seconds
3962.47 will allow you to perform
more quality repetitions
3965.58 safely over time.
3967.81 So what does building
anaerobic endurance look like?
3972.727 And then I'll tell you what
it's actually good for,
3975.4 in the true practical sense.
3977.71 What anaerobic endurance
exercise generally looks like
3982.44 is that if you decide to
do this for the first week,
3985.15 you might do this two
or three times a week,
3987.14 maybe even just once a week,
3988.63 depending on the other
things you're doing,
3989.91 we'll talk about programming at the end.
3991.85 And you would generate just three sets.
3994.11 So it might be three sets of
20 seconds of hard effort,
3997.52 followed by 100 seconds rest.
3999.41 Then you repeat 20 seconds of hard effort,
4001.0 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds
of effort, 100 seconds rest,
4003.967 and you might do that twice a week.
4006.29 And then each week you're
adding one or two sets, okay?
4010.8 In doing that, you will
build up what we call
4013.32 anaerobic endurance.
4014.82 What is anaerobic endurance?
4016.83 Well, let's ask why we fail?
4019.37 Anaerobic endurance is going
to be taking your system
4023.93 into greater than 100% of your VO2 max.
4028.47 It's going to be taking
your heart rate up very high
4032.37 and it's going to maximize your
oxygen utilization systems.
4037.73 That is going to have effects
4040.3 that are going to lead
to fatigue at some point
4043.88 in the workout.
4044.713 And that fatigue will
trigger an adaptation.
4047.24 So let's ask what
adaptation it's triggering.
4050.35 Well, it's triggering both
mitochondrial respiration,
4055.12 the ability of your mitochondria
to generate more energy
4058.24 by using more oxygen because
you're bringing so...
4060.84 You're maxing out,
4061.9 literally you're getting
above your VO2 max.
4064.23 You're hitting that
threshold of how much oxygen
4066.69 you can use in your system?
4068.05 One of the adaptations will
be that your mitochondria
4070.72 will shift such that
they can use more oxygen.
4075.37 And you're going to also
increase the capillary beds,
4080.08 but not as much as you're going to be able
4082.93 to increase the amount of
neuron engagement of muscle.
4087.63 So normally when we start to hit fatigue,
4090.02 when we're exhausted,
4091.21 when we're breathing really hard
4092.79 because the systems of the body are linked
4094.41 and we there's a
component to this as well,
4096.5 a kind of motivational component.
4098.84 After that third or
fourth or sixth set of,
4101.74 you know, 20 seconds on
a hundred seconds off,
4103.62 or if you're at the other
extreme 30 seconds on,
4105.56 and 10 seconds off.
4106.83 There's going to be a
component of you want to stop.
4109.86 And by pushing through and
repeating another set safely,
4112.96 of course.
4114.07 What you're doing is
you're training the neurons
4117.46 to be able to access
more energy, literally,
4121.15 convert that into ATP and for the muscles
4123.43 therefore to access more energy and ATP.
4125.96 And the adaptation is in
the mitochondria's ability
4129.52 to use oxygen,
4130.95 and this has tremendous carry over effects
4133.52 for other types of exercise.
4135.75 So while I know and appreciate
4138.02 that people are using high
intensity interval training
4140.13 of this kind or similar in
order to just like burn fat,
4144.7 you know, do their
workouts, quote unquote.
4147.6 It's very useful for
building a capacity to engage
4151.84 in short bouts of effort
repeatedly to really lock in.
4156.22 I don't want to use the word focus
4157.48 because it's not strictly mental focus,
4159.01 but to be able to generate
short bouts of very intense work
4164.15 this can be beneficial
in competitive sports
4166.83 or team sports where there's
a sprinting component,
4168.88 where the field opens up
and you need to dribble
4170.48 the ball down the field, for
instance and shoot on goal.
4173.03 Or where you're playing tennis,
4174.45 and it's a long rally.
4175.68 And then all of a sudden,
somebody really starts,
4178.6 you know, putting you back on your heels
4180.22 and you have to really make
the maximum amount of effort
4182.91 to run to the net and to
get the ball across in that.
4185.44 Things of that sort.
4187.13 Okay?
4188.24 There are a variety of places
where there's carry over
4190.33 from this type of training,
4191.71 but it does support endurance.
4193.77 It's about muscle endurance.
4195.17 It's about these muscles ability
to generate a lot of force
4198.85 in the short-term, but repeatedly.
4201.01 Okay?
4201.843 So that's the way to conceptualize this.
4203.06 And it is different than maximum power.
4205.56 Even though it feels like maximum effort,
4207.68 it is not the same as building
power and speed into muscles.
4210.9 Those are distinctly different protocols.
4213.27 So the key elements again
4215.45 are that you're bringing your breathing
4218.32 and your oxygen utilization
way up above your max.
4222.3 It's not quite hitting failure,
4224.5 but you're really pushing the system
4226.72 to the point where you are
not ready to do another set
4229.8 and yet you begin another set.
4231.32 You're not necessarily
psychologically ready.
4233.84 I'll talk more about
some of the adaptations
4235.66 that this causes in terms of
stroke volume in a few minutes
4239.03 when we talk about how it
is that work of this sort
4242.19 can increase our heart's ability
to deliver blood and oxygen
4245.77 to our lungs and other tissues.
4247.21 I'm going to get very
specific about how to breathe
4250.09 during these different types of protocols
4251.91 and what's happening at
the level of the heart?
4253.41 But I want to make sure I
touch on the fourth protocol
4255.87 which is high intensity
aerobic conditioning.
4259.14 So HIIT has these two forms,
anaerobic and aerobic.
4262.2 And you just heard about anaerobic.
4264.92 High-intensity aerobic conditioning
4267.41 also involves about three to 12 sets.
4271.31 Starting off of course, with fewer sets
4273.62 as you're getting into this training
4274.8 and then extending into more sets
4277.09 as one parameter you could expand.
4279.47 Has again the same ratio of three to one.
4282.43 So 30 seconds on 10 seconds off,
4283.99 or one to five, 20 seconds
on 100 seconds off,
4286.77 or a very powerful tool for
building up aerobic conditioning
4290.11 is a one-to-one ratio.
4292.85 A one-to-one ratio is powerful
for building on average.
4299.33 Most of the energy systems involving,
4302.05 remember we had these nerve
muscle blood, heart and lungs.
4307.372 A one-to-one ratio
might be you run a mile.
4310.82 And however long that takes,
4312.14 let's say it takes you six
minutes or seven minutes,
4314.28 then you rest for an
equivalent amount of time.
4317.56 Then you repeat.
4319.76 And then you rest for an
equivalent amount of time.
4321.43 So you might run first mile
is let's say seven minutes.
4324.38 Then you rest for seven minutes.
4325.47 Then you run a mile again,
4326.51 and it might take eight minutes
4328.167 and you rest for eight minutes.
4329.39 And you continue that for a
total of four miles of work.
4333.53 Four miles of running work, I should say.
4336.47 Or seven miles of work.
4337.92 You can build this up.
4339.06 Many people find that
using this type of training
4342.57 allows them to do things
like go run half marathons
4346.14 and marathons even though
prior to the race date,
4349.6 they've never actually run
a half marathon or marathon.
4352.75 Now, that might seem incredible.
4354.79 It's like how could it be
that running a mile on,
4357.68 and then resting for running a mile
4359.66 and then resting for an
equivalent amount of time,
4361.54 running a mile, resting
for equivalent amount time
4363.66 for seven miles allows
you to run continuously
4366.93 for 13 miles or for 26 miles.
4370.46 Well, I'm not discouraging people
4372.23 from ever doing the
long duration endurance.
4374.7 I think that is very important.
4376.45 But it's because it builds
up so many of these energy
4380.63 utilization systems.
4381.81 It really teaches you
to engage, excuse me,
4384.65 the nerve to muscle firing.
4386.81 It improves ATP and
mitochondrial function in muscle.
4392.31 It allows the blood to deliver more oxygen
4395.41 to the muscle and to your brain.
4397.94 And I'll explain how that is.
4399.87 And it allows your heart to
deliver more oxygen overall.
4404.45 And it builds a tremendous lung capacity.
4406.66 And we will talk about
exactly how to breathe
4408.56 and how to build lung capacity.
4410.44 Both for sake of warming
up and for performance.
4412.73 So what would this look like?
4413.77 And when should you do this?
4415.96 Well, it's really a
question for these workouts
4419.56 of asking how much work can
one do in eight to 12 minutes,
4423.44 right?
4424.273 And then rest, and then repeat.
4425.6 How much work can you do
for eight to 12 minutes
4427.29 then rest and then repeat?
4428.24 And how many times should you do this?
4430.16 Well, this is the sort of
thing it's pretty intense.
4432.91 And so you would probably
only want to do this two,
4436.1 maybe three times a week
4437.27 if you're not doing many other things.
4438.81 I will talk about how this program
4440.39 can be moved in with
other forms of training.
4442.67 But I'll just give you a little hint now.
4444.51 It's very clear and it's
described in the review article
4449.31 are referred to and we will
link another article as well.
4452.33 That concurrent training,
doing strength training
4454.827 and the endurance training
of any of the four kinds
4457.32 that I'm describing today can be done.
4459.77 You can program those in the same week.
4461.73 But you want to get four and ideally six
4464.98 or even better 24 hours
between these workouts.
4468.29 Because it is very hard, for instance,
4470.75 to do a one-to-one mile repeats
4473.42 like run a mile rest for equivalent time,
4475.107 run a mile rest for equivalent time
4476.87 to do that two or three times a week,
4478.6 and also do weight training before
4480.44 or do a long run afterwards.
4482.38 That would quickly lead to
break down for most people,
4485.11 unless you have very, very good
energy utilization systems.
4488.99 You're really kind of
advanced or elite athlete,
4492.1 and or dare I say you're using tools
4495.51 to enhance your performance
at the level of blood
4497.71 or hormones.
4498.543 And I'm actually going to
talk about those at the end
4500.15 and why they work?
4501.6 So we have four kinds of endurance.
4503.32 Muscular endurance.
4504.38 We have long-duration endurance.
4505.97 We have high intensity
interval training of two kinds,
4508.14 anaerobic and aerobic.
4509.83 And this last type, the
aerobic one works best.
4513.35 It seems if you kind of
do this one-to-one ratio.
4515.55 So how would you use these and
what are they actually doing?
4518.35 Let's talk about the heart
and the lungs and oxygen,
4521.88 because that's something
that we can all benefit
4524.54 from understanding.
4525.93 And it will become very
clear in that discussion
4528.67 why this type of training is very useful
4531.3 even for non-athletes in
order to improve oxygenation
4534.83 and energy utilization of
the brain and the heart.
4538.53 The brain and the heart are probably
4540.11 the two most important systems
4541.47 that you need to take
care of in your life.
4543.34 Yes, your musculature
needs to be maintained.
4546.17 If you want to build it, that's up to you.
4547.97 But you should try and
maintain your musculature,
4550.07 but maintaining or
enhancing a brain function
4553.07 and cardiovascular function.
4554.79 It's absolutely clear are
key for health and longevity
4557.785 in the short and long-term.
4559.3 And the sorts of training
I talked about today
4561.21 has been shown again and again and again
4563.21 to be very useful for enhancing
the strength of the mind.
4567.68 Yes, I'll talk about that.
4569.27 As well as the health of
the brain and the body.
4572.58 So let's talk about the
sorts of adaptations
4574.52 that are happening in your brain and body
4576.13 that are so beneficial in these
different forms of training.
4579.98 If you are breathing hard and
your heart is beating hard.
4583.15 So this would be certainly
in the high intensity
4586.67 anaerobic and aerobic conditioning.
4588.69 'Cause you're getting up near your VO2 max
4590.86 in high intensity aerobic conditioning,
4592.98 and you're exceeding your
VO2 max in high intensity
4596.13 anaerobic conditioning.
4598.72 What's going to happen is as of course,
4600.56 your heart beats faster,
4602.36 your blood is going to be
circulating faster in principle.
4607.03 Oxygen utilization in
muscles is going to go up
4611.31 and over time, not long,
4614.14 very quickly what will happen
4615.54 when those capillary beds start to expand?
4617.86 We talked about that.
4620.37 But in addition, because
of the amount of blood
4625.34 that's being returned to the heart,
4627.25 when you engage in these
really intense bouts
4629.64 of effort repeatedly,
4632.36 the amount of blood being
returned to the heart
4634.89 actually causes an east centric loading
4638.18 of one of the muscular walls of the heart.
4641.53 So your heart is muscle.
4642.68 It's cardiac muscle.
4643.91 We have skeletal muscle
attached to our bones
4645.44 and we have cardiac
muscle, which is our heart.
4648.39 When more blood is being
returned to the heart
4651.14 because of the additional
work that your muscles
4654.63 and nerves are doing,
4657.16 it actually has the effect of creating
4659.49 an east centric loading, a
kind of pushing of the wall,
4664.87 the left wall.
4666.01 I realize I'm not using
the strict anatomy here,
4668.04 but I don't want to get
into all the features
4670.01 of the structural features of the heart.
4672.58 But the left ventricle
essentially getting slammed back
4678.03 and then having to push back
4680.58 in a kind of east centric
loading of the cardiac muscle
4683.24 and the muscle thickens,
4686.41 but not because the
heart thickens overall,
4689.06 it's actually a strengthening
of the cardiac muscle
4692.01 in a way that increases
what we call stroke volume.
4695.13 Meaning as more blood is
returned to the heart.
4698.04 There's an adaptation
where the heart muscle
4700.05 actually gets stronger and
therefore can pump more blood
4704.57 per stroke per beat.
4706.4 And as it does that, it delivers
4709.89 because blood contains glucose
and oxygen and other things.
4714.13 It delivers more fuel to your muscles
4716.4 which allows you to do yet
more work per unit time.
4720.16 Okay?
4720.993 So when we hear that,
oh, you know, so-and-so
4723.04 has a or maybe you have
a nice low heart rate
4726.81 that maybe you're one of
these really extreme folks
4729.01 like 30 or 40 beats per minute,
4730.64 although most people are
sitting at 50, 60, 70, 80,
4733.14 that's your resting heart rate.
4734.72 If you exercise regularly
4736.21 and you do long duration aerobic work,
4739.04 your heart rate will start to go down,
4741.82 your resting heart rate.
4742.89 It will increase the stroke
volume of your heart.
4745.41 If you do this high
intensity type training
4747.6 where your heart is beating very hard.
4749.37 So maybe the one-to-one
ratio mile run repeats
4752.8 that I described a minute ago.
4754.08 Let's say you do that twice
a week for three or four.
4757.27 And I said, it could go all
the way up to 12 rep sets,
4760.13 which is a lot.
4760.963 I don't recommend people start there.
4762.56 Pretty soon, the stroke
volume of your heart
4765.22 will really increase.
4766.34 And as a consequence,
you can deliver more fuel
4768.9 to your muscles and to your brain,
4771.49 and you will notice that
you can do more work
4775.49 meaning you can do the same
work you were doing a few days
4777.64 or weeks ago with relative ease.
4780.23 Your cognitive functioning will improve.
4782.93 This has been shown again and again,
4784.82 because there's an
increase in vasculature.
4787.0 Literally, capillary
beds within the brain,
4788.87 the hippocampus areas that support memory,
4791.54 but also areas of the brain
that support respiration,
4794.7 that support focus,
4795.89 that support effort.
4797.36 This isn't often discussed,
4798.66 but the ability to deliver more blood
4800.83 and therefore more glucose,
4802.31 remember neurons run on
glucose and oxygen to the brain
4805.7 is a big feature of why
exercise of the kind
4808.81 of describing helps with brain function.
4811.84 Now, weight training does
have some positive effects
4815.67 on brain function also.
4816.99 When I say weight training, I'm really...
4818.98 I should be more specific.
4820.2 I really am referring to strength
and hypertrophy training.
4823.46 Strength and hypertrophy training
4825.64 especially if it's of the sort
where you get into the burn
4828.42 as we talked about last episode
4829.7 and you start generating
lactate as a hormonal signal
4832.13 that can benefit your brain, et cetera.
4834.01 It can have positive effects on the brain.
4836.69 And frankly, there haven't
been as many studies
4838.93 of resistance training strength
4840.577 and hypertrophy training
on brain function,
4843.06 mainly because most of those experiments
4845.13 are done in mice or
primates, non-human primates,
4848.67 I should say.
4849.503 And it's hard to get mice
to do resistance training.
4853.06 Okay?
4853.893 It's hard to get humans
to do resistance training.
4855.25 It's definitely hard to get
mice to do resistance training.
4857.14 There are ways to do it,
4858.16 but it's hard to get
them to do say, you know,
4860.63 three sets of eight on the
deadlift and then do some curls
4863.58 and then do some chin-ups
and this kind of thing.
4865.5 Okay?
4866.453 It's pretty easy to get a
mouse to run on a treadmill
4868.55 and you can set the
tension on that treadmill
4870.98 to make it so that it's
easier or harder for the mouse
4873.78 to turn that wheel.
4875.54 So that's one of the reasons.
4877.47 However, it's very clear
4879.57 and you should now understand intuitively
4881.58 why the kind of standard
strength and hypertrophy
4884.55 type workouts are not going to activate
4888.02 the blood oxygenation and
the stroke volume increases
4891.7 for the heart that the sorts of training
4893.71 I'm talking about today will.
4895.41 It just doesn't have the
same positive effects.
4898.73 Now, that isn't to say that
if you just weight train
4901.08 that you'll be dumb or that
you'll lose your memory
4904.0 over time, you might,
4905.37 but it is to say that endurance work
4908.6 in particular the high intensity
4910.63 and long duration work that
I've talked about today.
4913.12 The two high intensity protocols
4914.48 and the long duration work has been shown
4916.95 again and again and again,
4918.55 to have positive effects
on brain function.
4920.81 Not through the addition of new neurons,
4922.58 sorry to break it to you,
4924.06 but that's not a major
event in the exercised
4927.18 or non-exercised human brain,
4930.13 for reasons we can talk
about in a future episode.
4932.64 But it still has many positive effects
4935.08 through the delivery of things like IGF-1,
4937.85 but also just through plain
oxygenation of the brain
4941.71 and the way it promotes the
development of microvasculature
4945.74 to develop, to excuse me,
4947.21 to deliver new neurons more nutrients.
4950.05 If neurons don't get oxygen
and glucose, they do die.
4953.49 Unless there's another
fuel source like ketones
4956.22 which can replace the glucose.
4958.9 If you don't give oxygen to neurons,
4961.31 if you don't deliver enough to them,
4963.24 you get what's called ischemia,
4964.55 you get little micro strokes.
4966.01 So the type of exercise
I'm talking about today
4968.93 in generating intense heart rate increases
4972.04 provided that safe for you to do.
4974.04 Breathing hard,
4975.03 that's going to deliver oxygen in blood,
4976.7 increase stroke volume of the heart
4979.31 and is going to improve brain function
4981.98 has been supported by many, many quality
4983.93 peer-reviewed studies.
4985.6 So that's one form of positive adaptation.
4988.85 I also talked about just sort
of performance adaptations.
4991.18 How doing high intensity
aerobic conditioning
4993.7 of the mile repeats type
training can actually
4997.04 improve your ability to do
long bouts of intense work.
5000.84 It also seems like it dovetails
5003.49 or is compatible with resistance training
5006.07 that's aimed towards
strength and hypertrophy.
5008.44 Now, in full disclosure
the data seemed to indicate
5011.36 that if people just weight
train or train for strength,
5013.98 so three reps, rest five minutes,
5017.04 three reps of heavyweights, et cetera.
5018.58 Yeah, you'll get much
stronger than you would
5020.99 if you're doing things like
five repetitions up to 12,
5024.65 or 12 to 25 reps and you're
going out for long jogs.
5028.38 There's always going to be
a compromise in adaptations,
5030.89 unfortunately
5031.94 It does seem like you can
do concurrent training
5033.97 as I mentioned before,
if you allow anywhere
5035.81 from four to six or ideally
24 hours between workouts.
5039.64 As I mentioned in the previous episode,
5041.24 if you want to know if you
are recovered from a workout?
5044.35 A great way to do that is to apply
5045.93 the carbon dioxide tolerance test,
5048.08 which is four breaths in and out,
5049.66 inhale, exhale, inhale exhale,
5051.01 inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
5052.42 then a big inhale and then
a slow controlled exhale.
5056.04 If that slow controlled exhale
is 60 seconds or longer,
5060.44 it means that your parasympathetic,
5062.12 your calming nervous system
is under your control.
5064.73 And it's likely, I should say likely
5066.6 that systemically your whole
nervous system has recovered
5069.36 from whatever it is that you've been doing
5070.82 and experiencing in life
including work in relationships.
5073.48 If not, you might want to
take a rest day, dare I say.
5077.78 Or Costello's on is what?
5080.35 He's 10 now.
5081.27 I think he's on his 12,000 thrust day.
5084.66 Most people need I should say,
5086.8 one to two full rest days per week.
5089.0 I know there are people going to say
5089.99 that's ridiculous and okay,
5091.42 maybe you have amazing recovery abilities,
5095.0 also depends on training intensity.
5096.5 Many people benefit from having one or two
5098.28 full rest days per week.
5099.89 At least one, some people don't need to.
5102.31 But if you are not able
to extend that exhale
5106.31 on the carbon dioxide tolerance
test past 60 seconds or so,
5110.6 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances are,
5114.09 your so-called sympathetic nervous system,
5116.11 your stress system is chronically elevated
5118.29 and you're not really putting the brake
5120.34 on that system enough.
5121.57 And that's a subconscious thing.
5123.21 There are ways that you
can accelerate recovery,
5125.74 but I would encourage you to
listen to the previous episode.
5128.14 It's time-stamped for
how to assess recovery.
5130.89 So how often to program these things
5132.49 will depend on the other
things you're doing.
5134.67 I think it's perfectly reasonable
5136.04 to do this type of training
with other types of training.
5139.38 And I'll talk about a variety
of combinations of those
5141.96 toward the end of the episode.
5144.26 I do want to talk about
how to deliver more energy
5147.21 and oxygen.
5148.68 These are tools that are extremely useful,
5151.33 I believe and that are
grounded in physiology.
5154.45 That three things I'd like to talk about,
5157.04 are how to breathe?
5159.26 What to do immediately after
training and hydration?
5163.9 And I promise I will get
back into programming
5166.45 and sort of protocols,
5167.55 but these are vitally
important to your ability
5169.666 to perform endurance work in particular.
5173.66 And they are grounded
in how neurons and blood
5177.44 and oxygen and your heart work together.
5179.67 So let's first talk about
breathing or respiration.
5183.92 We breathe a couple of different ways,
5185.59 but let's just remind
ourselves why we breathe?
5187.41 We breathe to bring
oxygen into our system,
5190.08 and we breathe to get
rid of carbon dioxide.
5192.5 And we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide
5195.45 in order to utilize fuel and
for our brain and body to work.
5199.03 It's not the oxygen is good
and carbon oxide is bad.
5202.4 They have to be present
in the appropriate ratios.
5205.3 So one thing that is
very clear is our ability
5209.08 to deliver oxygen to working
muscles enter our brain
5213.02 is going to be important for our ability
5215.71 to generate muscular effort
5217.38 especially of a kind of what
I was talking about today,
5219.53 but also weight training and other forms
5221.29 of skill-based effort, et cetera.
5223.07 And our ability to think.
5224.87 If you're holding your
breath for too long,
5226.36 if you're breathing too much,
5227.99 if you're what they call
over-breathing or under breathing,
5230.15 if you're shallow breathing,
5231.14 if you're mouth breathing,
5232.07 these are all things that
can really impede mental
5235.3 and physical performance.
5236.19 So let's make it really simple
5237.82 and then I promise to do a
future episode all about recipes.
5241.243 There are two main sources
of air for your body
5244.9 and it's air coming in through your nose
5246.32 and air coming in through your mouth.
5247.67 In general nasal breathing is better.
5250.79 It scrubs the air of bacteria and viruses.
5254.58 You have a microbiome in
your nose that benefits.
5257.64 There are a number of reasons,
5258.87 it's also just a more efficient
system believe it or not,
5261.31 even though it feels like
you can gulp more air
5262.91 with your mouth.
5263.91 Getting good at nasal breathing is useful.
5267.95 A gear - System of the
type that Brian McKenzie
5270.26 and colleagues have developed,
5271.37 I think is a good way
to conceptualize this.
5272.97 If you're doing long duration work,
5274.89 try and do it all nasal breathing.
5276.46 If you have deviated septum,
5278.07 it's probably cause you
don't nasal breathe enough.
5281.43 Mouth breathing is something
that many people suffer from.
5286.02 You are more prone to infections.
5287.78 It's not as efficient, et cetera.
5289.56 There is a place for mouth breathing.
5290.91 However, it's usually, if you
need to do a strong exhale,
5296.15 oftentimes you can discard
more volume through the mouth,
5299.58 unless you're very trained
at nasal breathing.
5302.0 So if you're doing high
intensity training,
5303.85 a good way to conceptualize
this is to exhale
5306.9 on the max effort,
5308.79 and then to inhale on
the less intense part.
5312.9 So that might be as you're
generating the movement,
5315.89 you know, you're in the
concentric part of the movement
5317.84 you exhale, right?
5319.46 Just like on a bat swing
or something like that,
5321.73 or fighters and martial artists
5324.12 do this differently depending
on how they were trained
5326.18 and their different purposes,
5327.14 but they kind of like huh or ssh,
5329.04 they kind of exhaling during the effort
5331.44 and then inhaling on the
portion of the repetition
5334.86 that is not the highest effort portion.
5337.41 Usually that's the eccentric phase
5339.64 of anything involving or
rowing and things of that sort.
5344.14 So nasal breathing is great,
5347.05 but as you increase the
intensity of your endurance work,
5349.5 you will need to incorporate the mouth.
5350.79 So a gear system would look something
5352.08 like first gear would
be just nasal breathing
5354.25 or second gear would also
be just nasal breathing.
5356.4 But with more effort, third gear again,
5358.66 power speed endurance has
a lot more about this.
5360.46 You can go to their website.
5361.88 I think it's a very intelligent
way to conceptualize this.
5366.03 As you go into more max effort,
5368.21 then you're going to third
and fourth and fifth gear.
5370.5 And at some point you're not
thinking about nose or mouth.
5372.8 You're just trying to
hang on for dear life
5374.42 and complete the work safely.
5376.24 And that means breathe through
5378.2 whatever orifice works for you.
5381.73 So that's one aspect, nose versus mouth.
5385.25 The other aspect is whether
or not you're using your ribs,
5388.71 the intercostal muscles are these muscles
5390.65 that the Bruce Lee had these
remarkable intercostal muscles
5394.99 that allow you to lift the
rib cage or the diaphragm
5398.7 which is a skeletal muscle
that sits below the lungs.
5400.81 Just to remind you, when you inhale,
5402.13 the diaphragm moves down,
5403.2 when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.
5407.19 Okay?
5408.58 Here's something that most people don't do
5411.37 and would benefit tremendously from.
5412.92 And I can say this
because Andy Galpin's lab
5414.84 has done work on this
exploring how warming up
5418.68 the intercostals and the
nerve to diaphragm pathways
5421.7 before any kind of endurance work
5424.13 or in the first few
minutes of endurance work
5426.43 can allow you to breathe more deeply
5428.88 and to deliver more oxygen to the blood,
5431.569 [burps] excuse me,
5433.13 and to the muscles and to
be able to do more work
5436.81 more efficiently.
5437.9 So what that involves
is sometimes sitting,
5440.37 sometimes standing and
just really concentrating
5442.42 on two things.
5443.59 We always hear about how we
should diaphragmatic breathe.
5446.17 And that means that our belly
moves out when we inhale.
5449.01 So [inhales deeply] our stomach expands,
5451.37 but also expanding the intercostals
5454.22 which means actually raising
the ribs, chest breathing.
5456.7 We're all told that in yoga class
5458.37 don't breathe with your
chest this, [inhales deeply].
5460.63 But actually that is warming
up the intercostal muscles.
5464.51 So this is also a great
way to generate adrenaline
5467.24 if you do it a little bit intensely.
5469.43 So let's say you're feeling
unmotivated to train,
5472.29 I don't particularly like
doing endurance training
5474.85 until I'm actually doing it.
5477.56 So I use and benefit
from having a practice
5480.45 where I'll just sit there
and for about three minutes
5482.23 I'll just breathe very deeply
trying to raise my chest
5484.6 as much as I can for maybe a minute,
5486.48 and then contracting my diaphragm
5489.94 and expanding my stomach
outward when I inhale.
5492.41 By the end of that you're
actually delivering more oxygen
5495.11 to your system.
5497.07 My lab has looked at this in
a totally different context.
5499.66 Andy's lab has looked at it in the context
5501.4 of physical performance.
5503.74 So warming up the breathing
muscles should make sense,
5507.33 given that you now know
that muscles and neurons
5510.28 need glucose and they need
oxygen in order to function.
5513.88 And so that's a great warmup.
5514.93 You can also do this while walking
5516.74 or while getting on the
bike and starting to peddle,
5519.13 really starting to think about warming up
5521.53 the breathing system.
5522.95 And then you can decide if
you want to do pure nasal
5525.1 or a combination of nasal and
mouth breathing and so on.
5528.85 So that's something that
we don't often hear about.
5530.41 The other one.
5531.72 The other tool, rather that I talked about
5533.84 in a previous episode,
I'll just mention again,
5535.33 is some people when they
do endurance type work
5537.66 they get a stitch in their side.
5539.34 They feel like they've got a side cramp.
5541.55 Very rarely is it actually
a skeletal muscular cramp,
5546.88 it's oftentimes it's a referenced
pain of the phrenic nerve
5551.79 that innervates the liver.
5552.9 So the phrenic nerve is responsible
5554.3 for the movement of the diaphragm.
5557.36 It is a very important system,
5559.08 but it has a number of
what we call collateral.
5561.32 So it branches to other organs.
5563.12 Runs over other organs.
5564.84 Sometimes when we're breathing shallow
5566.82 and we are in physical motion
5568.57 and we're engaging in physical effort,
5570.37 we'll feel that side stitch.
5571.75 And we think, oh, I've got a
cramp or maybe I'm dehydrated
5574.1 or maybe I need to run
with my hands over my head,
5577.01 excuse me.
5577.97 Typically, you can
relieve that side cramp,
5580.52 which isn't a cramp at all.
5581.71 That side stitch by doing
the double inhale, exhale,
5584.62 really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply]
5586.71 And then sneaking a
little bit more air in.
5589.83 That's a double kind of firing
5592.35 or what we call volume of action potential
5594.48 sent from the phrenic
nerve to the diaphragm,
5598.07 which will also activate that collateral,
5600.6 that branch literally of the nerve
5602.52 that innervates the liver.
5603.97 And then when you exhale,
5606.32 you offload a bunch of carbon dioxide,
5608.18 but if you repeat that a few times often,
5611.79 in fact, for me every time
but often what'll happen
5614.01 is that side stitch will
just naturally disappear.
5616.33 Just means you're not breathing properly.
5618.07 You're the phrenic
nerve is firing in a way
5620.84 that's kind of aggravating
that referenced pain.
5623.49 There's nothing kind of voodoo
or mysterious about this.
5625.95 It just has to do with the
way that the different nerves
5628.78 travel in the body.
5630.26 So as you set out on your run
5632.08 or maybe you're going to do
some muscular endurance work
5634.88 or high intensity work,
5636.78 warming up the intercostals,
5638.62 warming up the diaphragm is good.
5641.16 And there are exercises and there is work
5643.89 that you can do to
strengthen the intercostals
5646.38 and to strengthen the diaphragm
5648.48 during bouts of this kind of effort.
5650.24 And I would say that one of the ways
5652.06 that you can do that best
is by really focusing
5654.737 on getting the maximum
diaphragmatic expansion
5659.21 and chest lifting.
5660.7 What we're all told now not to do,
5661.96 you know, don't chest
breathe, belly breathe.
5663.84 The intercostals are there for a reason
5665.64 and they are perfectly
good at filling your lungs.
5667.317 And they work best when they collaborate
5669.12 with your diaphragm.
5670.24 But when you are starting to fatigue
5672.78 to start to really inhale deeply
5675.1 and try and really expand those to deliver
5676.78 more oxygen to your system.
5679.31 While we're talking about
delivering more oxygen
5681.23 to your system,
5682.27 I want to share with you a useful tool
5684.07 that will now make total sense
mechanistically why it works,
5687.07 which is oftentimes when
we are on a long run
5691.07 or in long duration bouts of effort.
5694.5 We will hit the so-called wall, right?
5697.06 We will bonk.
5697.893 I think they used to call it,
5699.21 do they still call it that Costello?
5700.76 He's asleep.
5702.41 We bonk.
5703.243 Where we just we think
no, we can't continue.
5705.84 It's a curious thing as to
whether or not that's neural
5708.75 or whether or not it's fuel-based,
5710.76 there's certainly going
to be a psychological
5712.94 or motivational component.
5714.49 But one way that you can
reveal this kind of extra gear,
5717.83 the capacity to push on is
by understanding the way
5720.21 that different muscle fibers
use energy differently.
5724.47 Remember the fast-twitch
phosphocreatine system
5726.917 and the slow twitch
system that relies mainly
5728.91 on lipids and glucose.
5730.47 Okay, well, even if you
don't remember all that,
5732.4 if you've been running
steadily for a long time
5734.017 and you're starting to fatigue
5735.46 and you feel like it's time to quit.
5738.52 You may have not tapped into
an alternative fuel source.
5741.74 One thing that you can
do is you can actually
5743.6 increase your speed.
5745.2 This is also true of work
where you're doing repetitions
5748.87 with kettlebells or something.
5749.94 You can start to increase your speed.
5751.7 So run faster, pedal faster,
row faster, swim faster
5755.78 not all out sprint.
5757.67 But in doing that, you're
shifting the the muscles
5760.4 and the nerves over towards
utilizing a separate fuel source
5763.8 or a distinct fuel source.
5765.74 Maybe the phosphocreatine system
5767.2 if it's a quick about
of intense acceleration,
5770.46 or maybe it's a combination
of lipids and carbohydrates
5774.04 in your system that weren't
available to you prior.
5777.11 Now, of course, if you completely deplete
5778.53 your liver glycogen,
5779.363 you completely deplete everything,
5781.4 you're only going to be
running on stored fuel and fats
5784.2 and eventually you'll
start metabolizing protein,
5787.28 muscles themselves.
5788.82 But this is a kind of a
unique way to realize that,
5793.59 oh, you weren't out of energy at all,
5796.58 you're just over-relying
on one fuel source.
5799.02 And this is the reason why,
5800.53 especially elite athletes
are starting to both rely
5803.34 on carbohydrates.
5804.173 So they're doing the whole carb depletion
5805.71 then carb loading thing.
5806.78 They're loading up their
liver and their muscles
5808.35 with plenty of glycogen
by eating pastas and rice
5810.994 and stuff before races.
5811.879 But they are also ingesting
ketones during races,
5816.93 during long bouts of effort,
5818.47 because ketones can be
a quick form of energy.
5820.7 There's no reason why
you can't use ketones
5822.64 if they are taking exogenous
ketones and carbohydrate.
5826.11 And in combination, remember
the body is accustomed
5828.73 to using multiple fuel sources,
fatty acids, carbohydrates
5832.36 all these things.
5833.193 It's only in the, you
know, of internet age
5835.78 that we think in terms of,
5837.17 oh, well you're either keto
or you're burning sugar,
5840.75 or you're fat adapted
or key or fat fasting
5844.73 or fast fasting or fat fatting.
5846.992 Costello woke up when I said fat fatting.
5848.8 I'm not talking about you Costello.
5850.31 So the point is that your body
5852.19 is used to using multiple fuel sources.
5853.78 So if you're kind of hitting that wall,
5855.7 sometimes accelerating can
actually allow you to tap
5858.62 into a new fuel source or
combination of fuel sources
5861.08 just based on the way
that muscles use fuel.
5863.78 So that's another tool.
5865.53 The other thing that's really
important to think about
5867.2 in terms of endurance
type work is hydration.
5870.55 And I think hydration is
important for all forms
5873.13 of physical work and
exercise not just endurance.
5876.19 The deal with hydration
is that we've been taught
5880.56 about hydration all wrong.
5881.99 But let's remember what neurons work on?
5885.05 What do they use in order to fire?
5886.93 Well, they certainly need water, right?
5890.67 We need water in our system, I should say.
5892.91 But remember they use electrolytes,
5894.7 sodium and potassium to
generate those action potentials
5897.06 to actually get neurons to contract,
5898.87 to be able, excuse me, muscles to contract
5900.8 and for our brain to function
and to be able to think.
5906.03 Typically, we're going to lose anywhere
5908.19 from one to five pounds of
water per hour of exercise.
5912.21 And that's going to vary tremendously,
5913.7 it's going to vary on weather,
5915.5 it's going to vary on intensity,
5917.41 probably more like five pounds,
5919.02 if it's hot day and you're
exercising very intensely.
5923.1 So about one to five pounds per hour.
5926.23 Now, you know how much you weigh.
5928.69 So if you think about
your weight in pounds,
5932.62 once you lose about one to 4%
of your body weight in water,
5938.08 you're going to experience
about a 20 to 30% reduction
5941.87 in work capacity.
5942.89 In your ability to generate
effort of any kind,
5947.34 strength, endurance, et cetera.
5949.85 You are also going to
experience a significant drop
5952.45 in your ability to think and
perform mental operations.
5955.58 So hydration is key.
5956.813 Now, many people have been told,
5958.54 well, if you urinate
and your urine is clear,
5961.81 well, then you're hydrated enough.
5963.52 Sometimes that's true.
5964.72 Sometimes that's not true.
5966.33 Also and this isn't a
topic I enjoyed discussing,
5969.7 but a urine is a biological phenomenon.
5972.709 It's actually filtered
blood every once in a while
5976.77 and if there's a kid and
it's a family friend,
5978.46 I'll say, "Did you know that your pee
5979.777 "is actually filtered blood?"
5981.097 And they usually kind of go wide-eyed.
5982.71 But then they go, "Oh,
that's kind of cool."
5984.04 Like kids have this natural curiosity
5985.72 about blood and pee and stuff.
5987.61 That's not contaminated by
our preconceived notions
5991.19 of those things being gross,
5993.57 because you're in being filtered blood
5996.4 can give you some indication as to whether
5998.47 or not you're hydrated enough or not.
6001.05 And in order to really assess that,
6003.57 it's not going to be sufficient to urinate
6006.43 into another volume of water and assess
6008.5 whether or not your urine
is very dark or very light.
6010.27 It actually requires
urinating into a small volume
6012.53 and saying, well, is it
darker or lighter than before?
6015.05 It's not something you really
want to do most places.
6019.52 The etiquette of most
gyms and environments
6022.29 is not suitable for that.
6023.81 But one of the things that you can just do
6026.7 is you configure,
6027.533 well, I'm going to lose one to
five pounds of water per hour.
6030.86 You can show up to exercise
reasonably hydrated
6035.74 with electrolytes.
6036.91 So potassium, sodium and
magnesium are really key.
6039.31 Yes, it's true, you can die
from drinking too much water
6042.21 in particular because it forces you,
6044.5 if you drink too much water,
6045.71 you excrete too many electrolytes
6047.42 and your brain will shut off.
6049.08 You'll actually your heart
will stop functioning properly.
6051.54 So you don't want to over
consume to the extreme either,
6054.8 but there are a number of equations
6057.28 that go into figuring out
how much water you need
6059.59 based on how intense
your training, et cetera,
6062.04 body size, et cetera.
6062.99 Just remember you burn,
you lose, excuse me
6065.55 about one to five pounds
of water per hour,
6068.58 depending on how hot it is,
6069.413 and how intensely you're exercising.
6071.34 Once your body weight drops by one to 4%.
6074.32 So you can just figure,
6075.6 well, if you lose five pounds per hour,
6077.81 you exercise for two hours.
6080.12 Let's say you're about 200 pounds,
6081.52 that's about 10%.
6082.93 Okay?
6083.763 Well, you want to replace that
before you very quickly or not.
6087.49 You want to replace that all along
6089.14 before you start experiencing
6090.57 this massive 20 to 30% reduction
in work capacity of muscles
6093.89 and the brain.
6094.723 A simple formula.
6096.08 What I call it, the Galpin equation.
6098.12 Hereafter, referred to
as the Galpin equation
6101.26 is a formula that gets you
close to the exact amount
6104.59 that you would want that Dr.
Andy Galpin came up with,
6107.51 which is your body weight in pounds
6110.13 divided by the number 30.
6112.2 And that is how many
ounces you should drink
6114.22 for every 15 minutes of exercise.
6117.31 So once again, the Galpin equation.
6119.62 Your body weight in pounds divided by 30.
6123.49 That's the amount of fluid
to drink in ounces, right?
6129.69 Every 15 minutes of exercise.
6132.42 Now, if you are sweating a lot,
6133.88 you may need more.
6135.06 Okay?
6135.893 If you're already very well hydrated,
6137.8 you may need less,
6139.12 but that's a good rule of thumb to begin
6141.999 and to start to understand
the relationship
6144.81 between hydration and performance.
6147.49 There is a phenomenon in
which gastric emptying,
6152.25 the ability to move stuff out of your gut,
6154.45 including water and
electrolytes out of your gut
6157.44 and into the bloodstream and for delivery
6159.9 to the tissues of your body for effort
6161.92 is hindered when you get
above 70% of your VO2 max.
6165.38 In other words when you're
doing high intensity training
6168.47 sometimes people experience
that ingesting water
6172.16 during intense training is difficult.
6174.94 It is something that can
be actually trained up.
6177.94 It's a matter of learning to kind of relax
6180.84 your abdominal muscles.
6182.73 And there's some other
aspects of adaptation
6185.68 that will allow you to drink
during higher intensity work.
6189.38 As Galpin says, don't
try and ingest fluids
6194.027 when you're working out or competing
6196.95 at higher than 70% of VO2 max
6198.84 if you've never done it before.
6199.86 You want to train up this capacity.
6201.93 People can learn how to
consume fluids during a race
6204.38 or consume fluids during bouts of exercise
6207.06 that are very intense.
6208.79 And a lot of people don't want to do that,
6210.44 'cause they don't want to have
to stop to urinate, et cetera.
6212.75 But given the crucial role of hydration
6215.5 for muscular performance
and for brain performance,
6218.64 it seems that if you're
going to be doing a lot
6220.66 of high intensity interval training
6222.79 of the various concepts talked about today
6225.17 or high intensity training of any kind
6226.96 that hydration is key and learning
6229.04 or in other words, getting
your system to adapt
6231.18 to ingesting fluids in the
middle of these workouts
6233.63 is something that seems beneficial.
6235.66 At least to me, in terms of the trade off
6238.29 between being dehydrated
and the somewhat discomfort
6241.35 of maybe drinking some fluids.
6242.47 So you sip small amounts
of fluid initially
6244.67 and then you're able to
take bigger and bigger gulps
6246.68 as time goes on.
6247.513 And pretty soon you're able
to drink mid-set or be,
6251.71 excuse me, not mid-set.
6253.11 Please don't do that between
sets and your workout
6255.12 or while you're still breathing
hard after a mile repeat
6257.41 or something of that sort
without much disruption
6260.01 or any at all to your performance.
6262.04 Last episode we talked
about how to assess recovery
6265.26 and things that you might want
to do to improve recovery,
6268.22 how exposure to ice baths
6269.76 and cold showers can reduce inflammation
6271.62 which can be great for recovery,
6273.55 but can inhibit some of the adaptations
6276.7 for strength and hypertrophy.
6277.97 Because inflammation isn't good or bad.
6280.54 Inflammation isn't like a
nice person or a mean person.
6283.94 It's both.
6284.88 It's a great thing for
stimulating adaptations,
6288.6 but you don't want it around too long.
6290.33 And so we suggested that
you not do ice baths
6292.46 within probably six hours of any training
6295.66 where the goal was hypertrophy
or strength training.
6298.77 There is some evidence
that getting yourself
6300.9 into an ice bath or cold
shower after endurance training
6304.93 can actually improve the
mitochondrial aspects
6309.99 of endurance exercise that
you can get improvements
6312.81 in mitochondrial density,
6314.8 and you can get improvements
in mitochondrial respiration
6318.76 by doing that afterwards
6320.05 and that it can facilitate recovery.
6322.12 That's still a bit of
a controversial area.
6324.82 I do think that what I mentioned earlier
6326.4 that waiting at least six hours
6327.76 and probably more like
24 hours between workouts
6330.63 is a good idea.
6331.463 That getting at least one
full day of rest each week,
6334.34 for some people that'll be two.
6335.61 I have to say I'm one of these people
6337.21 that after two days of
absolutely no exercise,
6340.1 I do perform better
consistently across all aspects
6343.4 of physical performance and
mentally I feel better as well
6346.79 even though I load to take those days off
6349.16 unless I'm really exhausted
6351.2 it does seem to help my training.
6353.23 Some people can train seven
days a week and they're fine.
6355.24 I think it just is there's a
lot of individual variation.
6357.86 You want to work on sleep
and maximizing sleep
6359.81 for recovery nutrition,
of course, as well.
6362.84 I talked about sleep in
the first four episodes
6366.4 of the podcast.
6367.233 If you have trouble with sleep
6368.77 definitely check out those episodes.
6371.13 It's very clear and a
number of sports teams
6374.75 even some folks that I work with,
6376.84 and Andy Galpin and others
are starting to incorporate
6380.11 a what's called a
parasympathetic down-regulation
6382.63 after training of any kind as
a way to accelerate recovery
6385.54 and enable you to do more work.
6387.46 In other words, get
back to work out sooner.
6389.54 What is parasympathetic downregulation?
6390.61 It means finishing your training
6393.63 and instead of just hopping on the phone
6395.88 or hopping into your car
6397.4 and heading off to take
five minutes minimum,
6400.67 maybe ideally more like 10 or 20,
6402.79 but for sake of time five minutes minimum
6405.22 and doing just some slow pure
nasal long exhale breathing
6410.31 or lying down and just kind of zoning out.
6413.11 That it seems can accelerate recovery
6415.85 and allow you to get back
into other types of work,
6419.04 mental work or physical work more quickly
6421.26 which makes total sense because
remember your nervous system
6425.42 and recovery and work
is a local phenomenon
6428.58 which muscles were you using.
6429.87 You know, were you using your glutes,
6431.43 your hams and your back
6433.11 or were using your shoulders, et cetera.
6434.73 But it's also a systemic thing.
6436.51 It's also about those neurons
6437.65 in the locus coeruleus that
are releasing epinephrine
6439.457 and you want to quiet all
that down after training.
6442.25 You want to really just zone out.
6443.99 Think Costello, channel
your inner Costello,
6446.72 and just mellow out for five to 20 minutes
6449.77 and then move into the rest of your day.
6451.88 Five minutes should be manageable.
6453.67 Even if it's just sitting in
the car with your eyes closed
6455.55 doing that downregulation breathing.
6457.58 I think you'll see big benefits in terms
6459.75 of allowing yourself to come back sooner,
6462.59 do more work over time
6464.49 and just perform and
feel better generally,
6467.34 as well as be able to
think about other things
6469.15 besides the just how
much the previous workout
6471.8 kind of beat you up.
6473.7 A couple more things I think
are going to be useful.
6476.03 And I do want to just pack these in,
6477.81 'cause we are closing out the
month on physical performance.
6480.6 And that's about
programming and about pacing
6484.97 and the kind of mental
aspects of endurance.
6488.32 So let's start with pacing and
mental aspects of endurance.
6492.71 I learned from a friend and
colleague here at the podcast
6497.33 that...
6498.163 Who's very active in triathlon
and marathon and other...
6500.65 Knows a lot about that whole world
6502.31 and the competitive landscape there,
6504.14 that pacing and literally physical pacers
6508.17 have a laser on the ground
6509.51 or visualizing or having a
pace car or a pace runner
6513.68 in front is actually not
allowed in many competitions.
6517.15 And if those are present
doesn't allow the race times
6521.13 to qualify as legitimate
record holding times.
6525.67 And that's very interesting to me
6527.42 because what we know is
that the visual system
6531.79 has this capacity to switch
back and forth between
6534.95 what we call panoramic vision
6536.23 where we're not really
focused on anything.
6537.98 Things are just flowing past us
6539.8 or our eyes are just kind of zoned out.
6542.33 So I can do this right now
and you won't be able to tell
6544.64 but I'm looking at the
corners of the room.
6546.23 I see Costello down there on the floor.
6547.85 I see my podcast team here
6550.36 and I can also see the microphone.
6552.63 I can see myself in this environment.
6554.87 That's panoramic vision.
6556.15 Whereas if I draw my eyes to one location
6558.31 like right there in the
center of the camera,
6560.05 it's what's called a
vergence eye movement.
6561.63 So I'm contracting my visual window.
6563.86 The contraction of the visual
window when that's done,
6567.17 is the same thing that would happen
6568.38 if I was tracking say a
pace car or a pace runner
6571.35 or a laser on the ground.
6573.32 The mere bringing our eyes together
6575.33 to what we call a vergence
point has the impact
6579.01 of triggering the activation
of neural circuits
6581.79 in the thalamus.
6583.08 Things like zona incerta,
6584.55 if you really want to
know what their names are,
6586.12 of these brain areas.
6586.953 As well as in the brainstem that activate
6589.7 the so-called alertness system,
6591.07 things like locus coeruleus,
6592.43 whereas panoramic vision tends to bring us
6595.43 into states of relaxation.
6596.99 You can actually leverage
us during your runs.
6599.76 Let's say you're out for a long run
6602.1 or you're swimming or you're cycling.
6604.01 This is probably easiest
to imagine out of the water
6606.572 before I do in the water as well.
6608.45 If you focus your attention on a landmark
6610.64 that you're going to run to,
6612.37 you'll find that it's much easier
6614.07 than if you don't actually
have a set milestone
6617.32 or landmark that you're going to run to.
6619.34 However, if you were to
continue that repeatedly
6621.64 just going milestone after
milestone, after milestone,
6624.27 you would feel more mentally fatigued
6626.54 and you would actually be able
6627.7 to degenerate less work overall.
6630.58 One thing that can be useful
is focusing on a milestone,
6635.16 running to that milestone or biking
6637.19 whatever it is the activity happens to be,
6638.7 and then dilating your field of view
6640.7 to relax the system and
then continuing again.
6643.64 So it's this kind of active contraction
6646.19 or of the visual window and then dilation
6648.55 of the visual window.
6649.7 Contraction of the visual
window allows you to generate
6651.84 more effort but there's
a cost to doing that,
6653.56 because neurons consume energy.
6655.01 And now you know how they do that.
6656.8 Whereas dilation allows you to essentially
6659.194 be more efficient, right?
6661.29 Now, pacing is not allowed or
having a pacer, a visual pacer
6666.37 because it does allow
you to access systems
6668.74 in the brain and body that
allow you to create more energy,
6673.01 more effort.
6673.843 And so I find it interesting
6674.94 that I think in a kind
of subconscious genius
6677.27 the race officials and
the governing bodies
6680.42 of these races have said,
6681.82 okay, sure, having a pacer
there or someone in front,
6684.4 you can draft off of them,
6685.39 there's actually a kind
of a aerodynamic effect
6688.48 of having someone in front of you
6689.41 that makes it easier to run in
the wake of their airstream.
6693.49 So to speak.
6694.43 Same as true in cycling.
6696.29 This is why the cycling teams are so good
6697.92 at maneuvering and packs.
6699.12 In very specific ways, you
can go faster with less effort
6702.32 if you're drafting as it's
called behind somebody.
6705.23 But as well where you place
your vision will allow you
6708.7 to generate more effort.
6710.28 And so it's interesting
that they've taken out
6712.1 this kind of, if you will,
6715.26 performance enhancing tool.
6717.43 I imagine and I have to imagine
6719.73 it's the appropriate word here.
6721.02 That good runners, good
cyclists have the ability
6726.21 to create a kind of
pacer in their minds eye.
6730.42 I have to imagine that they're
not just completely allowing
6732.74 their attention to drift,
6733.81 although they do that when they
want to be in highly efficient
6736.39 mode generating effort
without having to tax
6738.64 their mental capacity.
6739.77 And remember mental
capacity is neural energy
6742.73 and consumes glucose energy
that they could devote
6745.48 to the functioning of their body.
6746.99 But that when needed that they
can focus their energy in,
6750.64 and actually kind of chase a
mental pacer or pick milestone.
6754.27 So this is a mental game
that you can play as well.
6757.41 It's a little bit hard to do
in the context of weightlifting
6759.79 in the gym.
6760.623 It's more of a moving
through space kind of thing,
6762.7 but some people do this by
counting reps, et cetera.
6766.01 I think it's especially
suitable for endurance type
6769.82 of exercise, especially done outside.
6772.18 One of the reasons I hate
running on a treadmill
6774.01 is it just feels like it's never ending.
6776.02 And I've never tried one
of these Peloton things.
6778.09 I try and avoid looking at screens
6779.45 as much as I possibly can.
6781.21 But if you try this next
time you're out for a run
6783.43 or a swim.
6784.263 What you'll find is
that you have a capacity
6785.72 to engage a system of higher energy output
6789.75 when you focus your eyes
on a particular location,
6791.68 but you want to use that judiciously
6793.31 because your goal of course,
6795.0 is to become efficient at
moving through space over time
6797.66 and not taxing your brain
and body to the point
6799.89 where you arrive at the end of that,
6802.53 unless it's race day just
completely tapped out.
6805.67 So that's a kind of
interesting aspect of running.
6809.13 If you're a fan of running, which I am,
6812.02 and you get the chance to look
at any of the documentaries
6814.74 or docu-drama has made
about, [clears throat]
6817.31 excuse me, about Steve Prefontaine.
6819.28 It was clear that he was mostly
in a battle with himself,
6822.13 but that he was also a highly
competitive individual.
6824.44 And you'll see this in some of his races.
6826.27 I do encourage you to look
some of those up on YouTube
6828.62 or see the docudramas.
6829.76 They're quite good.
6830.72 Where he ran the...
6833.64 Essentially was 12 laps on a track.
6835.48 It's essentially the five.
6836.615 It is the 5,000 meter race
6837.85 where essentially three miles.
6839.7 And he essentially tried
to sprint the whole thing
6841.94 which is ridiculous.
6842.79 Actually knowing what you know today
6844.05 you'll realize that Steve Prefontaine
6845.93 basically was pulling
from strength, speed,
6848.52 power, muscular, endurance,
6850.71 long duration effort, high intensity,
6852.54 aerobic, anaerobic as he sort of tried
6854.24 to maximize every fuel system.
6856.08 And you'll see that in
the races that he runs,
6858.7 but that when runners are
nearing the final laps,
6862.74 the so-called bell lap of a race,
6864.3 they'll often look to one another to see
6866.2 where somebody is obviously
to assess their progress
6868.98 and how close somebody is?
6870.47 But when somebody gets past,
6872.91 oftentimes you'll see someone
access this mysterious kick,
6877.3 this ability to tap into
some additional gear
6880.28 that allows them to run forward or faster
6883.09 when they themselves actually thought
6885.19 that they were maxed out.
6886.7 So someone could be running
for the finish line.
6888.84 They're convinced they're going to win.
6889.99 They're going max effort
6891.16 or at least they perceive max effort.
6892.5 Someone passes them.
6893.55 And all of a sudden
max effort has changed,
6896.25 because of that visual target
6897.97 they are able to access higher levels
6900.54 of speed and output and
effort and performance.
6903.06 They don't always catch
up to that person and win,
6905.26 but having a target a
milestone is a powerful way
6909.66 that we can generate more
force and energy in anything.
6913.01 And the visual system
is the way that we bring
6915.69 those milestones into our brain,
6918.55 which then brings about epinephrin,
6920.51 which brings about neural firing,
6922.34 which allows us to
access whatever resources
6924.76 happen to be available to us.
6926.55 So I find this fascinating
because people often wonder,
6930.64 like where does the kick come from?
6932.37 Where is this kind of gift
of an additional gear?
6935.38 Where is that deeper resource?
6937.01 And we often express it and talk about it,
6939.29 in kind of psychological
terms like heart or willpower
6942.68 or that something kind of
got transplanted into us
6945.56 or descended into us.
6946.75 And not to remove any of the
spiritual aspects of sport
6950.31 or running or effort of
the human, you know, heart.
6954.54 But it's very clear
that the nervous system
6957.27 when it has a specific visual target
6959.58 can generate the sorts of intense effort
6962.77 that it couldn't otherwise.
6964.17 And it sometimes even comes as a surprise
6965.81 to the person generating the effort.
6968.09 I promised that I would
talk about programming,
6970.4 meaning when and how many times a week
6973.968 to do the various workouts
related to endurance
6976.607 and how to merge those with
other types of exercise
6979.46 that you might be doing
for strength or yoga
6981.68 or other things that you
might be doing like work
6983.94 and other things, unrelated to exercise.
6986.45 Since that's a vast space
with many different parameters
6990.62 and you all have different
lives and lifestyles
6992.53 and backgrounds with fitness, et cetera.
6995.2 What I'm going to do is I'm going to put
6997.22 three different levels
if you will or protocols
7000.84 that one could adopt in
a link on the show notes.
7005.79 So in the caption on YouTube,
7007.82 if you click on that link,
7008.94 you'll be able to see
three possible combinations
7012.64 of endurance work, strength,
and hypertrophy work
7015.07 or endurance work, flexibility
and hypertrophy work
7018.25 that are grounded in many
of the major publications
7020.96 that Dr. Andy Galpin and
colleagues and other people
7023.5 have described including this review
7025.465 that's also linked there
on concurrent training
7028.47 and how one can use concurrent training,
7030.77 meaning training for endurance,
7032.13 training for strength,
7033.03 training for hypertrophy,
7034.22 training for all these different things
7035.49 without having to train
constantly everyday
7037.27 twice a day, et cetera.
7038.96 So if you are interested
in taking the protocols
7041.83 that you learned about in this episode
7043.577 and in previous episodes
and combining those,
7046.21 we've placed them there for you
7047.77 as a completely zero cost resource.
7049.9 Please understand they are not wholly...
7052.72 Costello agrees.
7053.61 They are not wholly.
7055.65 There will be variation in terms
7056.799 of what people can tolerate
and what they have time for?
7059.74 But I think they'll serve
as a useful guideline
7061.852 in getting started or in
continuing with an expanding
7066.0 on existing endurance work, strength work,
7069.15 hypertrophy work and so forth.
7071.27 Just really quickly.
7072.103 We didn't talk about
supplements much today.
7074.32 In the previous episodes I talked about
7076.06 the phosphocreatine system and
supplementing with creatine,
7078.65 I talked about beta alanine
7080.02 for kind of moderate duration work.
7082.75 You know really the only
things that have been shown
7085.661 to really improve endurance
work across the four varieties
7091.88 of endurance work I described today.
7094.25 They have essentially two forms.
7096.55 One, are stimulants.
7097.47 So things like caffeine will definitely
7099.68 improve endurance work and power output.
7102.32 There's a little bit of evidence
7103.5 that caffeine intake can actually inhibit
7106.13 the function of the creating system,
7107.72 but it's just one study.
7110.22 But that's interesting.
7111.61 If you want to read that study,
7112.58 you can put caffeine into www.examine.com
7115.43 and it will take you to that study.
7117.41 Many people get sore after workouts,
7119.41 in particular workouts
7120.5 that involve a lot of eccentric loading
7123.56 or workouts that are very novel
7125.19 where they've kind of pushed
it instead of moving gradually
7128.69 as I suggest into say high
intensity anaerobic endurance
7131.86 work of three sets of 20
seconds on 100 seconds rest.
7135.12 Maybe you get over ambitious
and you do eight sets.
7138.09 In which case you are extremely sore.
7140.54 Certain forms of magnesium in particular,
7142.34 magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E.
7145.28 Have been shown to be useful for removing
7149.27 or reducing the amount of
delayed onset muscle soreness.
7152.86 That form of magnesium
is distinctly different
7154.96 than the sorts of magnesium that are good
7156.41 for getting us into sleep.
7157.59 Things like magnesium three
and eight and Bisglycinate.
7160.0 And then there's this whole
thing about beet powder
7164.1 and beet juices and things
that increase nitric oxide
7168.26 and allow for more vasodilation
and therefore delivery
7171.02 of blood to muscle and
neurons and other tissues
7173.36 for long bouts of endurance work.
7174.99 Some people like beet juice
and they related compounds
7179.13 that increase arginine and vasodilation.
7181.26 Some people don't.
7182.61 Some people don't feel
good when they take those.
7185.34 Some people also don't feel good
7186.51 when they take beta alanine,
7187.87 because it can give them this feeling
7189.37 of kind of like itchy, creepy
crawlies under the skin
7192.72 kind of the niacin
phenomenon, the niacin flush.
7195.33 Some people don't mind that,
7196.36 or some people don't experience that.
7198.19 So when it comes to supplementation
7199.42 there's a lot of variety.
7200.34 But magnesium malate has
been shown to reduce soreness
7204.24 as sometimes that's good.
7205.66 Cold and hot contrast therapy for soreness
7208.08 things of that sort.
7209.21 But in general, we focused
mainly today on behavioral tools.
7214.22 You'll notice that all of
the tools are accessible
7217.92 without the need for lots of equipment.
7220.4 So I didn't say you need a rower,
7221.6 or you need a kettlebell
though those will work.
7223.9 And I hope I was able to
illustrate for you that endurance
7227.19 isn't just one thing.
7228.26 It's not just the ability to
go for long bouts of exercise
7232.48 of different kinds,
7233.46 that there's also this mental component
7235.01 because of the way that neurons work.
7236.7 And also that there are these
different forms of endurance
7239.73 of muscular endurance,
7240.79 that where you're going to fail
7241.68 'cause of the muscles and
muscle energy utilization
7245.06 and the nerves that innovate
those muscles locally
7247.11 not because of a failure to
bring in oxygen or blood.
7250.68 Whereas long duration effort.
7252.14 It's going to be more about,
7253.97 you know, being below your VO2 max,
7255.587 and your ability to be
efficient for long bouts
7258.06 of more than 12 minutes of exercise.
7260.21 One set, as they say of 12
minutes to maybe several hours.
7264.63 I should just mention with
long duration type work.
7267.21 You know, you could even
imagine raking in the yard
7269.34 or mowing a lawn depending
on how big that lawn is.
7271.38 I use to have job when
I was a kid mowing lawns
7273.99 and I'll tell you,
7275.48 we didn't have many neighbors
with very big lawns,
7277.48 but there are a few of them felt huge
7279.228 'cause they were really convoluted.
7280.94 And if you're pushing that mower,
7282.21 and these were the old fashioned mowers
7283.39 not electric mowers, it's work.
7284.77 That's also of the sort
that we call long duration
7287.25 endurance work.
7288.45 High intensity training we'll tap
7289.97 into yet other fuel sources and mechanisms
7292.99 as we learned today.

7360.66 You can support the podcast
at any level that you like.
7363.59 Please also check out our
sponsors that we mentioned
7365.75 at the beginning of the podcast.
7367.16 I know ad reads are not the first thing
7368.89 that people want to hear
when they're getting ready
7370.53 to consume scientific information.
7372.02 Please understand that the
ads and the sponsors allow us
7375.36 to bring the zero cost
to consumer information
7377.53 about science and science-related
tools to everybody.
7380.4 So if you have the means,
check out the sponsors.
7383.06 We only work with sponsors whose products
7385.1 we really believe in
and that I actually use
7387.16 and really love.
7388.61 There's no obligation, however.
7390.27 And we do talk about
supplements from time to time.
7393.58 Again, no obligation to use supplements.
7395.59 We also talk about behavioral tools,
7397.53 but if you are interested in supplements,
7399.47 please go to www.examine.com
to evaluate those supplements
7402.13 and their various effects.
7403.3 If you're curious about that.
7404.9 And we work with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.
7409.32 Thorne is a supplement manufacturer
7412.0 that we believe has the
highest levels of stringency
7414.37 in terms of the quality
of the supplements.
7416.75 And they are very precise
and very stringent
7419.88 about the amounts of
each of those compounds
7422.92 in the given supplements.
7424.05 This is a huge problem elsewhere
in the supplement industry.
7427.35 Many brands don't include
what they say they include
7430.16 on the bottle.
7430.993 It seems to show up every time
people test different brands.
7434.47 But Thorne continually tests out
7436.58 with the highest levels of
accuracy and stringency.
7439.26 If you want to see the
supplements that I take,
7440.97 you can go to www.thorne.com/u/huberman.
7445.64 And if you do that you can
see all the supplements
7447.71 that I take.
7448.543 You can get 20% off any of
those supplements as well.
7451.61 If you want to navigate
into the main Thorne site
7454.65 and you see a supplement
that you're interested in,
7456.61 you'll also get 20% off any
of those supplements as well.
7459.66 So that's www.thorne.com/u/huberman.
7463.4 So we have both cost-free and other ways
7466.73 to help support the podcast.

7516.31 And last but not least on
behalf of myself and Costello
7520.22 who's finally waking up for...
7521.86 Oh, no, he went back to sleep.
