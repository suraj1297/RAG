0.36 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.28 where we discuss science
4.029 and science-based tools for everyday life.
9.33 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.32 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.38 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.24 Today my guest is Dr. Nolan Williams.
17.58 Dr. Williams is a medical doctor
19.62 and professor of psychiatry
and behavioral sciences
22.29 at Stanford University School of Medicine.
24.69 His laboratory and clinic
focus on depression
27.0 and other mood disorders.
28.89 They focus specifically on the use
30.6 of transcranial magnetic stimulation,
32.91 which is a brain stimulation technique
35.1 that can either activate or
quiet specific brain circuits,
38.67 as well as circuits within the body,
40.56 in order to treat depression
and other mood disorders.
43.95 Other laboratories and clinics use TMS.
46.59 What sets apart the work of
Nolan Williams and colleagues is
49.59 that they combine TMS
with other treatments,
52.44 and some of those treatments
are among the more cutting edge
54.6 that you've probably
heard about these days,
56.22 including ibogaine, psilocybin,
MDMA, cannabis, DMT,
62.1 and other drugs that at this
point in time are experimental
65.58 in terms of clinical trials,
67.26 but that at least the
preliminary data show
69.48 hold great promise for the
treatment of depression
71.79 and other mood disorders.
73.26 In the course of my
discussion with Dr. Williams,
75.45 we covered things such as the history
77.67 of each of these drugs,
how they came to be,
80.13 and their current status in
terms of their clinical use
82.71 and legality.
83.88 We also talk about their safety profiles
85.8 both in children and in adults,
88.11 and we talk about what the
future of psychedelic research
90.75 and clinical use really looks like.
93.42 For instance, we discuss
how a number of laboratories
96.51 and clinics are modifying psychedelics
98.76 to remove some of their
hallucinogenic properties
101.37 while maintaining some
of their antidepressant
103.44 or anti trauma properties.
105.21 You'll also learn about
some fascinating research
107.04 in Dr. Williams' laboratory
focused on ketamine,
110.37 which is a drug that is
increasingly being used
112.74 to treat depression.
113.88 And contrary to common belief,
115.68 the effects of ketamine in
terms of relieving depression
118.8 may not actually arise from
its dissociative effects.
122.25 One thing that you'll find extraordinary
123.69 about Dr. Williams is
that not only does he have
126.24 vast knowledge of the various
treatments for depression,
129.09 but that he and his laboratory
are really combining
131.94 these treatments in the most potent way.
133.59 That is, combining psychedelic treatments
135.39 with brain-machine interface,
136.77 or combining brain-machine interface
138.24 with particular learning protocols.
140.1 That is, neuroplasticity protocols,
142.29 which can directly change
the brain in specific ways.
145.05 So today you're going to
learn a tremendous amount
147.69 about the neural circuitry
underlying depression,
149.91 as well as positive moods.
151.35 You'll also learn about
all the various drugs
153.09 that I described,
154.11 and you're really going to
learn about the current status
156.54 and future of the treatment
of mood disorders.
159.09 Today, you'll also learn about
a number of ongoing studies
161.58 in Dr. Williams' laboratory.
163.44 I should mention that they
are recruiting subjects
165.42 for these studies.
166.65 If you go to BSL,
168.0 which stands for Brain
Stimulation Laboratory,
169.83 so that's bsl.stanford.edu,
172.32 you have the opportunity to apply
174.15 for one of these clinical trials
175.44 for the treatment of depression
and other mood disorders.
178.23 I confess that the conversation
with Dr. Williams was,
180.6 for me, one of the more stimulating
182.67 and informative
conversations I've ever had
185.25 about psychedelics,
186.54 which is simply to say that his breadth
188.91 and depth of knowledge on
that topic is incredible,
192.42 and his breadth and depth of knowledge
193.95 in terms of the underlying brain science
195.69 and how it can all be combined
197.19 with clinical applications
is also extraordinary.
200.55 I'm sure that by the
end of today's episode,
202.23 you're going to come away
203.063 with a tremendous amount of
knowledge about the clinical
205.41 and non-clinical uses of those substances,
207.63 and you're going to understand a lot more
209.7 about how the healthy
and diseased brain work.
212.19 I'm pleased to announce
213.06 that the Huberman Lab
Podcast has now launched
214.83 a premium channel.
216.03 I want to be very clear
216.99 that the Huberman Lab
Podcast will continue
219.0 to be released every Monday
at zero cost to consumer
222.42 and there will be no change in
the format of these podcasts.
225.72 The premium channel is a response
227.31 to the many questions we
get about specific topics,
230.46 and it will allow me to really drill deep
232.47 into specific answers
related to those topics.
234.78 So once a month,
235.613 I'm going to host an ask
me anything, so called AMA,
238.59 where you can ask me anything
about specific topics covered
241.08 on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
242.19 and I will answer those questions.
244.02 Those of course will be recorded.
245.28 There will also be other
premium content available
247.77 to premium subscribers,
249.12 such as transcripts and
short videos of new tools
251.73 and unique tools for mental
health, physical health,
254.73 and performance.
255.93 If you want to check
out the premium channel,
257.49 you can go to hubermanlab.com/premium.
260.13 There is a $10 a month
charge or $100 per year,
262.62 and I should mention that a
large portion of the proceeds
265.14 from the Huberman Lab
premium channel will go
267.06 to support scientific research
269.01 that develops the very sorts of tools
271.44 that we talk about on
the Huberman Lab Podcast.
274.41 The rest of the support
275.34 for the Huberman Lab Podcast
premium channel will go
277.5 to supporting the regular
Huberman Lab Podcast.
279.72 Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium.
282.21 Before we begin,
283.043 I'd like to emphasize that
this podcast is separate
285.21 from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.
287.49 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
289.62 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
292.17 and science related tools
to the general public.
294.75 In keeping with that theme,
295.83 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
298.59 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
300.96 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
303.33 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
305.88 to help you better understand your body
307.41 and help you reach your health goals.
309.48 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
312.15 for the simple reason
that many of the factors
314.49 that impact your immediate
and long-term health
316.59 can only be analyzed with
a quality blood test.
319.26 One problem with a lot of DNA tests
321.33 and blood tests, however,
322.38 is you get data back about
levels of metabolic factors,
325.83 levels of hormones, et cetera,
327.45 but you don't know what to
do with that information.
329.34 InsideTracker makes interpreting your data
331.02 and knowing what to do
about it exceedingly easy.
334.23 They have a personalized
platform where you can go
336.36 and you can see those levels
of hormones, metabolic factors,
338.91 lipids, et cetera,
339.9 and they point to specific
nutritional tools,
342.33 behavioral tools, supplement
based tools, et cetera,
345.3 that can help you bring those numbers
346.59 into the ranges that are optimal for you.
348.81 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
350.16 you can go to InsideTracker.com/Huberman
353.13 to get 20% off any of
InsideTracker's plans.
355.98 Again, that's InsideTracker.com/Huberman

360.27 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
362.94 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
364.59 with cooling, heating, and
sleep tracking capacity.
367.65 I started sleeping on an
Eight Sleep mattress cover
369.81 a few months ago, and
it is simply incredible.
372.63 In fact, I don't even
like traveling anymore
374.4 because they don't have
Eight Sleep mattress covers
376.86 in hotels and Airbnbs.
378.66 One of the reasons
379.493 I love my Eight Sleep mattress
cover so much is that,
382.11 as you may have heard before
on this podcast or elsewhere,
384.69 in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
386.97 you need your body temperature to drop
388.53 by about one to three degrees.
390.12 And I tend to run warm at night,
392.13 which makes it hard to sleep
393.24 and sometimes wakes me up
in the middle of the night.
395.25 When you sleep on an Eight
Sleep mattress cover,
396.87 you can program the temperature
of that mattress cover
399.51 for specific times in the early, middle,
401.76 and late part of your night so
that the mattress stays cool.
404.82 And as a consequence, you
sleep very, very deeply.
407.52 It also tracks your sleep,
409.2 so it's paying attention to
how many times you're moving,
411.54 how deep your sleep is.
412.5 It gives you a sleep score,
413.79 all wonderful data to help
you enhance your sleep.
415.95 And of course, sleep is the
foundation of mental health,
418.38 physical health, and performance,
419.94 which makes an Eight Sleep a terrific tool
421.83 for enhancing not just your sleep,
423.54 but all aspects of your life really.
425.73 If you're interested in trying
a Eight Sleep mattress cover,
427.77 you can go to EightSleep.com/Huberman
430.29 to check out the Pod 3 cover,
431.79 and you can save $150 at checkout.
434.19 Eight Sleep currently ships
to the USA, to Canada, the UK,
437.82 and select countries in
the EU and Australia.
440.07 Again, that's EightSleep.com/Huberman

444.75 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
447.3 ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
449.28 that are the absolute highest quality.
451.56 The company was founded by
two all American swimmers
453.6 from Stanford, and everything
about ROKA eyeglasses
456.15 and sunglasses were designed
with performance in mind.
459.21 I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system,
461.31 and I can tell you that your
visual system has to contend
463.41 with some pretty significant challenges
465.21 in order to be able to see clearly
467.13 as you move from one area to the next.
468.69 For instance,
469.523 when you go from a shady
area to a bright area.
471.69 ROKA understands this and
have designed their sunglasses
474.06 and eyeglasses accordingly
475.38 so you always see with crystal clarity.
477.54 In addition,
478.373 because they were initially
designed for performance,
480.06 things like running and biking,
481.71 they're extremely lightweight,
483.09 but they have a terrific aesthetic.
484.68 So unlike a lot of
eyeglasses and sunglasses
486.78 that were designed for sports
488.16 and make you look like a cyborg,
489.54 they have styles that make
you look like a cyborg
491.52 if you like those, but
they also have styles
493.41 that you'd be perfectly
comfortable wearing to work
495.57 or out to dinner, et cetera.
496.86 They're really terrific glasses.
497.94 I love mine because I
can wear them anywhere
500.64 and I also use them when
running and going out hiking,
503.28 et cetera.
504.18 If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses or sunglasses,
506.46 you can go to ROKA, that's ROKA.com,
509.1 and enter the code Huberman
510.51 to save 20% off your first order.
512.46 Again, that's ROKA, ROKA.com,
514.89 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
517.2 On many episodes of the
Huberman Lab Podcast,
519.24 we talk about supplements.
520.77 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
522.9 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them.
525.42 Things like enhancing sleep
and the depth of sleep,
528.06 or for enhancing focus
and cognitive ability,
530.79 or for enhancing energy or
adjusting hormone levels
534.09 to optimal range for you.
535.65 The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
537.39 with Momentous supplements.
538.62 To find the supplements we discussed
539.94 on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
541.14 you can go to livemomentous,
spelled O-U-S,
544.11 livemomentous.com/huberman.
546.696 And I should just mention that the library
547.74 of those supplements is
constantly expanding.
549.93 Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
553.05 And now for my discussion
with Dr. Nolan Williams.
556.14 Thanks for joining today.
557.64 I'm really excited to
have this conversation.
560.13 It's been a long time coming
561.87 and I have a lot of questions
about different compounds,
566.01 psychedelics in particular.
567.36 - Yeah.
568.193 - But before we get into that discussion,
570.503 I want to ask you about
depression, broadly speaking.
574.17 Intractable depression.
576.66 How common depression is or isn't.
580.2 I heard you say in a
wonderful talk that you gave,
583.26 that depression is
584.76 perhaps the most debilitating
condition worldwide.
589.08 And yet,
589.95 in contrast to other medical
conditions like cancer,
594.18 we actually have a fairly
limited number of tools
597.3 to approach depression.
599.46 And yet number of tools
600.96 and the potency of those tools is growing.
603.24 So if you could educate us on depression,
605.19 I would really appreciate it.
606.36 - Yeah, absolutely.
607.193 So depression is a condition that,
610.95 it has a lot of manifestations, you know.
614.28 So you can have kind of a depression
616.65 that's primarily loss of interest.
618.54 You can have folks who feel very anxious
621.36 and they're kind of overactive.
622.65 You can have people who don't
have any anxiety at all,
625.29 and they're very underactive
626.46 and they have low
motivation to do anything.
629.154 You know, so you have this
huge range of symptoms
630.96 that are in that umbrella of depression.
633.51 And some of our work is to actually work
635.734 with folks like Conor Liston and Cornell,
637.95 and try to actually get biotypes
based off of neuroimaging
642.33 to see if we can kind of parse
out the different depression
645.6 kind of presentations,
and see that clinically,
649.2 and also see that in the brain.
651.24 Depression is the most
disabling condition worldwide.
655.44 What's interesting about depression is
656.97 it's both a risk factor
for other illnesses,
660.96 and it makes other medical and
psychiatric illnesses worse,
664.38 right?
665.476 So recently the American Heart
Association added depression
669.03 as the fourth major risk factor
671.43 for coronary artery disease, right?
673.2 So alongside the risk
factors that we know,
676.62 hypertension, high blood
pressure, hyperlipidemia,
679.56 high cholesterol, and diabetes,
you know, high blood sugar,
684.15 those three have been on
the list for a long time
686.85 and depression ended up
being added to the list
689.25 as the fourth one.
690.6 And you know, really interesting, right?
693.09 So in addition to taking medications
695.67 to address those other three risk factors,
697.71 we really have to be thinking
698.82 about how do you treat
folks with depression
702.03 to reduce the risk of having
a heart attack in the future?
705.78 And, you know, there's some
of that's being worked on now,
708.75 but we don't have a complete solution
710.52 to thinking about that at this time.
712.92 And then the other thing
that's interesting is
715.17 once you have a heart attack,
717.515 in the individuals that end
up having a heart attack,
720.69 the risk of having depression
after the heart attack is
724.23 higher than the normal population, right?
727.11 And so a lot of what we're
doing in the lab actually is
730.77 measuring kind of brain heart connections.
733.35 And we can actually, with
transcranial magnetic stimulation,
736.23 a form of brain stimulation,
737.58 we can actually decelerate the heart rate
739.35 and capture that heart rate deceleration
742.35 over the mood regulatory regions.
744.06 And so actually a direct
probe of that connection.
747.12 So it's interesting.
748.41 And so, you know, as you
said a second ago, you know,
752.16 it's a very disabling condition.
753.66 Moderate depression's about as disabling
756.59 as having a heart attack,
acutely having a heart attack.
759.48 Severe depression is disabling,
761.55 is having cancer without
treatment, you know,
764.49 and dying from a cancer without treatment.
767.04 And so, you know, it's
kind of underappreciated
771.24 just how disabling
depression is in that way.
774.18 And I think important
775.98 as stigma is consistently
kind of being reduced
779.79 over the years for mental illnesses,
782.82 then the idea that we can start
really putting more funding
786.09 and putting more focus at
the federal level, you know,
788.58 private foundation level, whatever it is,
790.68 at a given university
791.73 to thinking about developing treatments.
795.42 We've been very interested
796.95 in a very particular
clinical set of problems
800.91 around the most severe and
the most high acuity settings
806.46 that folks with depression
end up being in.
809.43 And that's in, you
know, emergency settings
812.31 where they go into inpatient units.
814.29 And you know, in the rest of medicine,
817.2 if it's talking about heart attacks,
818.82 if I start having chest pain right now
822.09 and you bring me to a
primary care doctor's office,
824.43 they're going to have a
certain number of tests
826.14 and treatments, right?
827.25 But very limited cuz it's
an outpatient facility.
830.55 If you bring me to the
emergency room after that,
831.997 there are more tests and more treatments.
834.36 If you put me in the
ICU or in the cath lab
837.72 where they do invasive
procedures to the heart,
840.84 there are more tests and more treatments.
842.85 In psychiatry, as we elevate
the acuity of an individual,
847.86 you go from being just
depressed to being depressed
850.2 and now thinking about ending your life,
852.12 the number of treatments
actually go down on average.
856.5 I mean, in some scenarios, they go up,
857.94 but on average they go down
and there are no tests, right?
861.09 And so we've been very focused
on that particular problem.
864.51 Somebody that maybe was doing, you know,
867.39 fairly okay with a pretty
moderate depression
870.06 and then their depression gets worse
872.01 and then they end up in
an emergency setting.
875.04 And the field really
hasn't developed a way
878.31 of consistently being
able to treat that problem
882.03 and folks end up getting
882.9 the same standard oral antidepressants
885.0 that they've been getting outpatient.
887.64 And I came to this because
I, you know, dual trained
891.18 as a neurologist and psychiatrist,
892.68 went back and forth between
neurology and psychiatry,
895.65 saw that in neurology we
have all of these ways
898.05 of treating acute brain based problems
901.08 and really wanted to
emulate that in psychiatry
904.05 and find ways to develop
905.34 and engineer new, you know,
brain based solutions.
909.78 - There's a lot to unpack there.
911.07 One thing that you said is,
913.47 I'd like to focus on a bit
more because I think we hear
916.8 that the brain and the
heart are connected,
919.11 but you described, I believe,
a direct relationship
923.34 between areas of the brain
associated with emotion
926.31 and heart rate.
928.17 - [Nolan] Yes.
929.312 - And that makes perfect
logical sense to me.
932.07 But I think at the same time,
935.13 many people out there probably
think of the relationship
937.83 between the heart and
the mind as kind of woo
941.46 or kind of a soft biology.
943.44 But here you're talking about
an actual physical connection.
946.02 - [Nolan] Yep.
946.853 - Between, what area of the brain is it?
949.36 - The first place where the
stimulation goes is called
952.95 the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
954.513 It's kind of the sense of control,
957.06 kind of governor of the brain.
958.38 And then what we know is
that when you use a magnet,
962.61 use kind of what we call Faraday's Law,
964.53 this idea of using a magnetic pulse
967.86 to induce an electrical current
970.59 and electrically conducting substances.
972.9 So in this case, brain tissue,
974.7 but not skull or scalp
or any of that, or hair.
977.97 You avoid all that, just the brain tissue.
980.22 Then you have a direct
depolarization of cortical neurons,
984.75 you know, the surface
of the brain's neurons,
987.39 in this dorsolateral prefrontal.
989.76 And if you do that in the
actual scanner, which we can do,
993.42 you can see that that distributes down
995.91 into the anterior cingulate and
the insula and the amygdala.
999.93 And ultimately the tract
goes into something called
1002.96 the nucleus tractus solitarius
1005.15 and ultimately into the
vagus nerve into the heart.
1007.82 So the heart very consistently
seems to be the end organ
1012.89 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
1016.01 If you measure heart rate in standard ways
1018.8 that cardiologists measure heart rate
1020.597 and you stimulate over
this left dorsolateral,
1023.42 you get a deceleration of the heart rate
1025.22 and it's very time locked
to the stimulation.
1028.43 So it's a two second train of stimulation.
1030.83 At one second, you see the deceleration,
1032.96 it goes down about 10 beats per minute,
1035.06 and then it'll drift back
up and there's a break
1037.07 for eight seconds on the stimulation.
1038.69 Drifts back up and the
stimulation goes back in
1041.39 and then the heart rate goes back down.
1042.92 And so you see the
heart rate just do this,
1045.35 10 beats per minute every train.
1047.51 And so we know, and if you
do that over visual cortex,
1050.81 you don't get that,
1051.643 or motor cortex, you don't
get any of those findings.
1053.78 It's really specific to
this kind of control region
1058.07 of the brain.
1058.903 And so, yeah, it seems to, you know,
1061.61 it's our work, other folks' work.
1063.68 Martin Arens in Europe, the Netherlands,
1066.83 work showing the same connections.
1068.99 I think it's been replicated
like four or five times.
1071.84 - So you mentioned left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
1076.22 Anytime I hear about
lateralization of function,
1078.29 I get particularly curious
1081.41 because obviously we have
two mirror symmetric sides
1086.36 of the brain.
1087.32 There are, you know,
rare exceptions to this,
1089.63 like the pineal and things of that sort
1092.12 that there is only one pineal.
1096.8 What is special
1097.67 about the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex?
1100.04 Does this have anything
to do with handedness,
1101.78 right hand or left hand?
1102.98 Because we know right-hand
and left-handedness has a lot
1104.9 to do with lateralization
of function for language,
1109.04 a topic for another time.
1110.54 But why do you think
1112.46 that left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex would be connected
1115.55 to the heart in this way?
1117.95 - Yeah.
1118.783 Yeah, I think, so left
dorsolateral is thought
1123.56 to be the side that when you excite it,
1126.35 when you kind of do
excitatory stimulation,
1129.8 potentiating sort of stimulation,
1131.39 that you can reduce depressive symptoms.
1134.81 And a guy by the name of Mike
Fox at Harvard demonstrated
1137.69 that if you have strokes in
the brain that cause depression
1142.217 and you put them on the human connectome,
1144.59 a hundred, you know, thousand patient map,
1146.96 and you ask the question
1147.92 what they're all
functionally connected to?
1150.2 Left dorsolateral.
1151.94 If you take lesions that
cause mania in individuals
1155.72 and you put those all on
the human connectome map
1157.82 and ask what the one common
area they're all connected to,
1161.84 it's the right dorsolateral.
1164.15 And so there seems to be
a hemispheric, you know,
1168.92 balancing of mood between
these two brain regions.
1171.89 And we know this from an
experimental standpoint too,
1174.65 because you can take
individuals with depression
1177.2 and you can excite the left
or you can inhibit the right
1181.007 and they're both antidepressant.
1183.5 You can excite the right
1185.9 and that's anti-manic in some studies.
1188.69 And so this idea that there
is this hemispheric balancing
1192.35 of mood is quite interesting, right?
1194.63 - It's incredibly interesting.
1196.55 And just so people know,
1198.23 if you're curious what the connectome is,
1201.23 connectome is a term that
was built out of this notion
1203.51 of genomes being large collections
1207.08 of sequencing and mapping of genes.
1209.0 They're proteomes of proteins,
1211.13 of connectomes is so-called connectomics,
1213.98 of connections between neurons.
1215.42 So the Human Connectome Project is ongoing
1218.598 and I find that incredible
1221.21 that within the Connectome Project,
1222.59 they can identify these regularities
1224.27 of right versus left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
1227.42 Especially since I've looked
at a fair number of brains
1232.88 from humans, certainly
not as many as you have.
1236.27 And if you look at the
architecture, the layers,
1239.84 the cell types, and
even the neurochemicals
1242.66 of which cells are expressing,
say, dopamine or serotonin
1245.6 or receiving input from areas
1246.98 that make dopamine or serotonin,
1248.81 they don't look that different
on the right and left side.
1251.42 And yet here we're talking
about a kind of an accelerator
1254.84 and a brake, if you will,
on depression and mania
1259.16 using what, at least by my eye
1261.92 and I think other people's
eye look to be basically
1264.23 the same set of of bits.
1266.3 The same parts list, more or less.
1268.37 So what gives these properties
1271.73 to the right and left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex?
1274.13 Is it the inputs they receive?
1276.11 Is this something that we
learn during development
1277.85 or do you think that
we come into the world
1279.68 with these hemispheric biases?
1282.26 - Yeah, it's a great question.
1284.0 And you know, it hasn't been worked out,
1286.01 which your original question was around,
1288.38 in a left handed individual,
which as you know,
1291.8 25% of those folks end up
having a right brain dominance
1295.55 or 1% of right-handed people
have a right brain dominance
1298.91 if it's flipped, right?
1300.14 And unfortunately that
study still hasn't been done
1304.07 at the level, 'cause that would
be probably pretty helpful
1306.41 for teasing some of this out.
1308.33 But, you know, it's still
being sorted out, right?
1312.59 We know enough to know
this phenomenon exists
1316.97 because we can use TMS as a probe
1320.54 and do these sorts of manipulations.
1323.24 But to my knowledge,
1325.61 there hasn't been anybody that's
gotten so interested in it
1328.07 that they've been able to get
a mechanism of why that is.
1332.36 But, you know, it's
kind of empirically true
1336.32 in the sense that you can push
and pull on those systems,
1339.17 or in the case of strokes that folks have,
1342.83 and then you kind of get their
brains and their brain images
1345.56 and look at where the strokes landed,
1348.02 those kind of causal
bits of information point
1350.42 to this asymmetry.
1353.39 - Interesting.
1354.223 Well, in that case, going
with what we do know,
1357.35 that stimulation of
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
1359.87 slows the heart rate down,
1361.28 transiently, but it slows it down,
1363.23 and seems to alleviate at least
some symptoms of depression,
1366.86 leads me to the question of
why would that be the case?
1370.4 Does it tell us anything
fundamental about depression
1373.52 that anxiety is inherent to depression?
1376.55 I think a faster heart rate is, you know,
1378.8 part and parcel with anxiety.
1383.93 In my laboratory, we've studied fear a bit
1387.08 in animals and in humans,
1388.28 and we often observe bradycardia
1390.92 where somebody or an animal
is afraid of something
1394.25 and rather than the
heart rate speeding up,
1395.99 it actually slows down,
1397.55 something that most people
don't think about or recognize.
1401.54 But given that stimulation
1404.937 of dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex slows the heart rate down
1407.15 and can alleviate depressive symptoms
1409.58 and that there are other
ways to slow the heart down,
1411.77 I have two questions.
1412.94 What do you think this tells us
1414.44 about the basic architecture of depression
1417.77 and its physiology at
the level of the heart?
1420.53 And does the circuit run in
the opposite direction too?
1423.38 If one were to have or find other ways
1425.48 to slow the heart rate down,
say with a beta blocker,
1428.63 does that help alleviate depression?
1430.55 - Yeah, no, that's a great question.
1431.69 So I'll answer the second question first.
1435.41 So we know that in the
ongoing trials of this,
1439.43 if you stimulate in the vagus nerve,
1442.678 in an implanted vagus nerve stimulator,
1444.5 you can actually, you know, have this,
1447.527 the afferent parts of the
vagus project ultimately up
1452.54 to the DLPFC through the cingulate
1454.88 through these anterior
insula, so that same,
1457.13 that obviously the same tract, right?
1458.9 And you can stimulate there
and alleviate depression,
1462.2 which seems very unusual, right?
1464.24 You're stimulating a cranial
nerve down on the neck.
1467.15 But if you can get up into the brain,
1469.37 you actually can improve
depressive symptoms.
1471.83 And so, you know, more evidence
1473.99 that this is a kind of a
whole track and system.
1477.83 And if you stimulate
in part of that system,
1480.62 it appears that you can improve mood.
1484.1 - And what if I were somebody
1485.54 who did not have a stimulating
electrode in my vagus nerve
1488.72 and I was dealing with minor depression
1491.45 and I decided I wanted to
take some other approach
1494.48 to slow my heart rate down by the vagus?
1496.52 For instance, exhale emphasized breathing
1499.64 or deliberately slow cadence
breathing, things of that sort.
1504.26 Is there any evidence that
behavioral interventions
1506.15 of those kinds can alleviate depression
1510.41 or some symptoms of depression?
1513.02 And is there any evidence
that it does indeed feed back
1515.36 to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
1517.1 to achieve some of that alleviation?
1519.14 - Absolutely, yeah.
1519.973 So there's a number of studies
implicating the dorsolateral
1524.45 in, say, you know, meditation,
1527.66 mindfulness, that sort of thing.
1529.34 And they're small studies,
1531.53 but pretty well designed
studies suggesting
1534.65 that behavioral interventions
in mild depression
1537.74 actually work quite well.
1539.6 There seems to be a volitional
threshold for depression
1543.14 where at some point you start losing,
1546.02 you go from being
completely in total volition
1549.14 to having kind of semi-volition.
1551.24 You have thoughts
1552.41 that you really have a
hard time controlling
1554.09 and that sort of thing.
1555.208 And when you go through that threshold,
1557.15 at some point it gets harder and harder
1560.27 for those sorts of things
to kind of kick in and work.
1563.21 And the extreme form of
that is catatonia, right?
1565.43 Where people in a very
severe form of depression get
1568.52 kind of stuck motorically, right?
1570.017 And they obviously can't,
they have no control
1574.19 or very limited control.
1576.26 And so, you know, I
think there's a threshold
1579.2 in which these sorts of
interventions will work.
1581.87 Exercise seems to really
be a good treatment
1584.9 for mild depression and it may work
1587.48 through the mechanism
you're describing, right?
1589.22 As we all know, you know,
1591.5 athletes hold a lower resting heart rate
1594.65 than folks that aren't, you
know, if you were an athlete,
1597.92 you had a lower resting heart
rate, you stopped exercising,
1601.28 and a couple years later
your resting heart rate
1602.9 in many cases goes up, right?
1604.64 And so maybe that's part of the process.
1608.36 I'm not aware of any
studies specifically looking
1612.98 at dorsolateral prefrontal physiology
1617.3 pre-post exercise, but it
would be a great study.
1619.88 I think that would be really
helpful to understanding this,
1622.64 especially if you had a
correlation of changes
1626.12 in kind of lowering of, say,
1627.05 heart rate with mood improvements.
1630.2 There's been a lot of work
with heart rate variability
1633.26 and depression and, you know,
1637.01 studies kind of point towards it.
1640.43 Not every study is positive for this,
1644.36 but quite a few studies say basically
1647.75 that lower heart rate
variability is associated
1652.13 with, you know, moderate
to severe depression.
1654.86 And that may be part of that mechanism
1657.02 of that heart brain risk.
1660.17 - So I'm both intrigued
and a little bit perplexed
1662.24 by this relationship between
heart rate and depression.
1665.9 On the face of it, I would think
of depression as depressed.
1668.87 So lower heart rate might
make somebody more depressed.
1671.15 You even mentioned catatonia
1672.32 or somebody that just
doesn't seem motivated
1674.84 or excited to do anything.
1676.31 I think of mania as elevated
heart rate and being excited.
1679.79 On the other hand, I realize that anxiety,
1682.85 which you know, brings about ideas
1685.7 as elevated heart rate is
also built into depression.
1689.03 Which brings me back to
what you said earlier,
1690.77 which is that when we say depression,
1692.69 are we really talking about
four or five different?
1694.82 - Yeah, that's right.
1696.23 - Disorders, for lack of a better word.
1699.26 And for what percentage of
people that have depression
1703.31 does some approach to
reducing heart rate work?
1708.35 Whether or not it's stimulation
1709.55 of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
1712.94 by way of transcranial
magnetic stimulation
1714.86 or by taking a beta blocker
or by stimulating the vagus.
1718.94 Can we throw out a number, a rough number?
1720.95 Does that help, 30%, 50%?
1723.41 How long lasting is that relief?
1725.39 - Yeah, and to be clear,
1726.848 the deceleration of the heart rate is
1730.31 in the moment when the
stimulation is happening,
1733.01 but it's not something
1735.05 that's necessarily maintained chronically.
1737.87 It's more of an indicator that
you're in the right network
1741.17 more than it appears
to be itself, you know,
1745.07 central to the mechanism.
1746.12 The heart rate variability piece may be,
1748.73 and there's some studies
that link the two,
1751.07 but the actual deceleration
seems to be much more
1753.32 of a marker that you're
in the right system.
1756.05 But you know, it very well could be
1757.4 that the heart rate system
1759.02 and the mood system just
sit next to each other
1761.09 and the stimulation hits both.
1763.1 If you look at how much of
the variance in the mood is
1766.49 explained by the heart rate deceleration,
1768.47 it's not a huge amount, right?
1772.22 So it only explains a small percentage.
1775.58 And so it's unlikely that
simply reducing the heart rate.
1781.4 And in fact, you know, for many years,
1783.26 propranolol and these sorts of drugs
1785.03 actually were implicating
causing depression.
1787.52 And so that's been kind of
debunked, but it's unlikely
1792.02 that simply decelerating
the heart rate's going to
1793.82 improve depression.
1795.29 But what it does tell you is
that if you're in that area
1798.83 that is the mood regulatory area,
1800.72 there's some parasympathetic
cortical kind of process
1804.23 that's going on that gets in
and causes this to happen.
1807.56 And it's, you know, it's
independent of mood.
1810.14 You can take a normal healthy
individual and you can do this
1814.58 and they're going to
decelerate their heart rate.
1817.49 - I'm so glad you mentioned
1818.45 the parasympathetic nervous system,
1819.95 which of course is the,
1821.15 most people think of
as the rest and digest
1822.8 or the kind of calming side of
the autonomic nervous system.
1825.65 As I'm hearing you say all of this,
1827.33 and in particular what you just told me,
1830.15 which is that it's not
1831.62 as if having a lower
heart rate protects you
1834.2 against depression
1835.033 or a higher heart rate is
associated with depression,
1837.47 although at the extremes
that might be true,
1839.9 but rather it's something
about the regulatory network,
1843.02 the ability to control
your own nervous system
1846.08 to some extent.
1848.03 And when I think about the
autonomic nervous system,
1850.1 I like to think about it as a seesaw
1851.9 of, you know, alertness and calmness,
1853.52 and when you're asleep
it's a lot of calmness,
1855.32 and when you're panicking it's
a lot of alertness to the...
1858.14 But that, and I don't think
this has ever been defined,
1861.11 and when I teach the medical students
1863.66 at Stanford neuroanatomy, my wish is
1865.52 that someday I'll be able
to explain what the hinge
1868.46 in that process would be, right?
1870.02 Not the ends of the seesaw.
1871.16 We know what the sympathetic
nervous system is
1872.87 and it's to wake us up and make us panic
1875.45 or make us feel nicely alert and calm.
1878.03 We know what puts someone
into sleep or a coma
1881.48 or makes them feel relaxed.
1883.4 But what shifts from one side
of the seesaw to the other
1886.31 and the tightness of
that hinge seems to be
1888.62 what you're describing,
1890.06 that depression is sort
of a lack of control
1892.76 over inner state so
that when I'm stressed,
1894.8 I can't get myself out of it.
1895.91 But when I'm feeling completely
collapsed with exhaustion,
1898.82 I can't get out of bed and be motivated
1900.74 to do the very things
1901.79 that would help me get out of depression,
1903.29 like a workout or social
connection or eat a quality meal,
1906.89 these kinds of things.
1908.06 So this is perhaps the first time
1910.46 that I've ever heard
about a potential circuit
1914.0 for the hinge, as I'm referring to it.
1916.01 Does that make any sense at all?
1917.665 - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
1918.778 - Okay, I just want to make sure
1919.611 that I'm framing this
correctly in my mind.
1921.027 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
1921.86 And in some studies,
1922.693 if you do the same identical stimulation
1925.22 on the right dorsolateral,
you can get an acceleration.
1929.12 You know, just kind of
further confirming this idea
1931.79 of lateralization, right?
1933.29 That it appears that even the
prefrontal cortex, you know,
1937.01 cortical areas seem to be
lateralized in this way.
1940.94 And, you know, it's less,
1944.69 the right finding is more variable
1946.94 depending upon the study.
1948.17 The left's very consistent in this way.
1950.898 So...
1952.141 - So we've talked about
transcranial magnetic stimulation
1954.23 for getting into these networks
1955.94 and I also just want to take
a brief tangent and say,
1958.549 'cause I've heard you say this before,
1960.29 I think it's so vital what you're saying,
1962.6 that it's really not
about stimulation of areas
1966.08 or any specific brain area
1968.03 or vagus nerve being important per se.
1971.33 It's really about a network, a connection,
1973.46 a series of connections.
1974.99 I think that's really important
for people to understand
1977.15 and is kind of a new
emerging theme really.
1980.3 The other thing that to me
seems extremely important
1983.63 for us to consider is
1986.167 what are these lateral
prefrontal cortices doing?
1991.46 Are they involved, for
instance, in sensation,
1994.07 sensing the heart rate?
1995.12 Are they involved in
thinking and planning?
1997.79 And this gets down to
a very simple question
1999.83 that I know a lot of
people have, which is,
2001.69 can we talk ourselves out of depression?
2004.42 If it's mild.
2005.71 Can we talk ourselves into a manic state
2009.76 or an excited state,
2010.81 a positively excited state
that doesn't qualify as mania?
2013.69 You know, other areas of the brain,
2015.22 I think of is responsible for perception
2017.8 or for motor control.
2019.69 But here we are in this
mysterious frontal cortex area,
2022.54 which people say executive
function, planning, et cetera.
2025.42 Are we talking about thoughts?
2027.58 Are we talking about structured thoughts
2029.19 or are we talking about
dreamlike thoughts?
2031.42 What in the world is going
on in the prefrontal cortex?
2035.53 And here I spend my career in neuroscience
2037.66 and I still can't really
understand what it's doing
2041.86 and maybe it's doing 50 things.
2043.63 - Yeah, no, it's a great question.
2045.43 So, you know, to...
2047.62 So one of the studies
that we've been working on
2050.44 in addition to the depression
work is actually trying
2052.54 to change trait hypnotizability.
2055.03 So David Spiegel and I
have been working on this
2057.52 and you know, he's found and
published this 10 years ago
2061.72 that a different part of
the left dorsolateral is
2065.83 functionally connected with
the dorsal anterior cingulate
2070.33 with a lot of functional
connectivity in high hypnotizables
2073.18 and not much in low hypnotizables.
2075.73 And that's kind of a different sub-region
2078.79 within this bigger brain region
2080.47 we call left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex
2083.32 than the part that seems to be important
2085.27 for regulating mood.
2087.01 And so the left dorsolateral
seems to have connections
2092.2 that are location specific
2094.54 within the overall kind
of named brain region
2098.11 that connect to various
parts of the cingulate
2100.57 and seem to regulate it.
2103.0 Right?
2104.101 And so if you knock out
2105.25 the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
2107.44 and you have people do the
Stroop task, for instance,
2110.8 which is a task where you
have, it's a simple task,
2113.827 you probably know this.
2115.3 You have people name the color of words.
2119.14 And so if I look at one of the
cards that they'll show you,
2125.05 it'll have the word red in red
2127.6 and that's very easy and
that's called a congruent.
2130.66 And then the incongruent
is red in the color blue
2136.03 and you have to name,
you have to say the word,
2139.87 you don't name the color.
2141.94 - So you have to suppress a response.
2143.77 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
2144.603 And so, I'm sorry, you name the color
2148.24 and you see the word
written in a different way.
2150.427 And so basically if you stimulate in a way
2155.38 that inhibits the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
2157.96 or either one,
2158.89 you can actually knock out
the ability to do that well
2162.46 and it'll take longer for
people on the incongruent cards
2166.48 to be able to name it.
2168.73 And so they have a kind of a time delay
2171.7 that's greater than they had
before they got stimulated.
2174.73 So that's a part of the prefrontal cortex
2177.94 that's different than the
part of the prefrontal cortex
2180.13 that's involved in mood regulation.
2182.41 The nice thing about TMS
is that you can go through
2185.47 and you can find these areas
that are functionally defined
2189.49 through brain imaging
and you can perturb them
2192.01 and answer the question
you're talking about.
2193.72 How do I understand this
part of the prefrontal cortex
2196.9 and its function, this part?
2199.06 And so we were able to
stimulate in an inhibitory way
2204.1 within the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex
2207.43 that's involved with this sort
of cognitive control area.
2212.11 And we were able to knock that area out
2215.17 and increase trait hypnotizability,
2218.32 so people had greater hypnotizability
2223.09 after they got active stimulation
versus when they got sham.
2227.32 And so it suggests that that
brain circuit is involved
2231.949 in the process of what therapeutic
hypnosis ends up being.
2237.55 But it's a very different region
2238.96 within the left dorsolateral than, say,
2240.85 we do when we do these very
intensive stimulation approaches
2244.48 to treat severe depression
2246.4 and we're able to get
people out of depression.
2249.16 You know, with the part
of the dorsolateral
2250.993 that seems to be lower in the, you know,
2253.69 kind of more lateral and
inferior on the DLPFC
2260.83 and connected with this
subgenual anterior cingulate,
2263.25 so the part of the anterior cingulate
2264.61 that processes emotion.
2266.89 - I'd like to take a quick break
2268.3 and acknowledge one of our
sponsors, Athletic Greens.
2271.3 Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
2273.79 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
2276.16 that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.
2279.04 I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,
2281.74 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
2283.96 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens,
2285.55 and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens once
2288.01 or usually twice a day is that
it gets to me the probiotics
2291.52 that I need for gut health.
2293.2 Our gut is very important.
2294.31 It's populated by gut microbiota
2296.86 that communicate with the
brain, the immune system,
2298.63 and basically all the
biological systems of our body
2301.03 to strongly impact our
immediate and long-term health.
2304.66 And those probiotics in
Athletic Greens are optimal
2307.69 and vital for microbiotic health.
2310.36 In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number
2312.19 of adaptogens, vitamins,
and minerals that make sure
2314.35 that all of my foundational
nutritional needs are met
2317.29 and it tastes great.
2319.15 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
2320.62 you can go to AthleticGreens.com/huberman
2324.01 and they'll give you
five free travel packs
2325.99 that make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens
2328.3 while you're on the road, in the car,
2329.59 on the plane, et cetera.
2330.88 And they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3K2.
2334.3 Again, that's AthleticGreens.com/huberman
2336.97 to get the five free travel packs
2338.35 and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
2341.14 Based on what you told
us about the Stroop task
2343.3 and the role of the prefrontal
cortex in the Stroop task,
2346.57 to me the Stroop task is
a rule switching game.
2349.63 You're saying in one moment,
2350.89 the rule is you read
whatever the word says
2354.1 and then you switch and then you say,
2356.17 the rule now is you tell me
2358.48 what color the word is written in
2360.4 and you suppress whatever
it is the word says, okay?
2363.25 - [Nolan] That's right.
2364.083 - Okay, a rule in some
sense is, like that,
2367.6 is a transiently adopted belief system.
2371.26 So I could imagine that in depression,
2373.21 which has all sorts of backstory to it,
2377.56 that of course the
psychiatrist or psychologist
2379.6 or friend can pull on that thread.
2381.1 Like for instance,
2381.933 somebody might believe that they are bad
2385.36 or that they don't deserve love.
2386.95 I'm trying to bring this
into the typical language
2389.05 that they would talk about.
2389.883 Or that they will never succeed.
2392.08 Or that even if they keep succeeding,
2394.39 it's just going to get harder and harder
2396.19 and it will never feel good.
2398.05 These are sort of rules
like the Stroop task.
2400.72 At some level.
2401.553 There are rules that are
more pervasive over time,
2403.3 unfortunately.
2404.53 But I could imagine that
if the PFC is also contains
2408.94 some sort of maps or algorithms
2410.77 related to rules of emotionality
2412.84 or self representation or
things that we've heard,
2415.6 I think there must be data out
there saying that, you know,
2418.51 whatever we heard in middle school
2419.83 when someone made fun of
us, we can remember that.
2421.557 'Cause I can remember
things that people said
2424.697 about a jacket I wore one day
2426.88 or something in the fourth grade, crazy,
2428.89 I didn't even like the jacket.
2431.32 Now I think it was kind
of cool, but anyway.
2433.63 The point being that we
have an intense memory
2435.58 for these things to set up a
sort of rule or a question.
2438.28 Like maybe I don't really know
how to dress, for instance.
2442.39 Maybe that's why I always
wear the same black shirt.
2444.82 But in all seriousness,
2445.99 it seems like the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex is
2448.39 in this amazing position to
access rules which are beliefs
2453.61 and beliefs are rules,
2454.75 and then for moments or
longer, to switch those rules.
2458.71 And so for somebody who's depressed
2461.23 to just simply look
themselves in the mirror
2462.76 and say, "You are great,
you are fantastic,"
2465.19 it feels like a lie if you
feel like garbage to say that.
2468.37 It doesn't fit with the rule.
2470.14 It's like saying that card is not red,
2472.9 that card is green, when your
eyes tell you that it's red.
2477.127 And it seems like there's
something about prefrontal cortex
2481.54 that in principle gives
flexibility to rules
2485.11 based on what we know
about the Stroop task.
2487.06 So given its connectivity,
2489.7 can we assume that the
talk therapy that occurs
2493.45 in the psychiatrist
office or with a friend
2496.21 or through journaling out something,
2499.03 because we do know that
reporting things about trauma
2501.73 or difficult circumstances
or the rules that we contain
2504.31 and tend to hide inside of us
about how we feel miserable
2507.67 about ourselves or anything really,
2510.58 that in rescripting that,
2513.34 that somehow it allows us
to do a sort of Stroop task
2517.03 on our beliefs.
2518.47 Is that a tremendous leap?
2520.54 I'm just really trying to
frame this in the context
2522.43 of what I and most people
think of as depression.
2524.95 - [Nolan] Yeah, totally.
2525.97 - Because the network components
are vitally important,
2527.95 but I guess what I'm
trying to figure out is
2529.42 like what are the algorithms
that govern prefrontal cortex?
2535.03 - Yeah, absolutely.
2535.863 So in a kind of standard
2537.58 cognitive behavioral
therapy session, right,
2540.666 what the therapist is trying
to do is identify those beliefs
2545.32 and you know, kind of
determine how fixed they are,
2549.94 you know, if they're
flexible as you're saying,
2552.07 and then help folks to find
another explanation for them
2557.71 and to kind of reintegrate that
potential other explanation
2563.41 into their memory system, right?
2566.86 Where I think TMS is really
interesting, actually,
2569.65 we had a lot of patients who've told me,
2571.15 like my therapist told me that
I wasn't trying hard enough
2574.96 in therapy, and you know,
and I really am trying hard,
2579.43 but these are, you know, moderate,
2581.11 pretty severe depressed patients.
2583.15 And as soon as we get them
well with the TMS approaches,
2586.66 you know, kind of rapid five day approach
2589.18 and the next week we come in and see them
2590.95 and they'll say,
2591.783 "You know what I did all weekend is
2592.616 I looked at my therapy books
and now I can understand it."
2595.6 And so, you know, I
actually see TMS as a way
2598.99 of having kind of exogenous
sorts of cognitive functions
2604.27 that in milder forms of depression
2607.03 we can pull off with psychotherapy.
2609.64 You know, this idea of being able
2611.11 to kind of turn that prefrontal cortex on
2614.26 and have it govern these deeper regions.
2617.32 In depression,
2618.153 the deeper regions govern
the prefrontal cortex.
2621.91 They precede the prefrontal
cortex timing-wise.
2625.27 And we've got some data in review now
2626.98 where we're seeing that
in depressed individuals
2630.22 that are responsive to
our rapid TMS approach,
2632.443 what we call
2633.37 Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy,
2636.76 or SNT, or SAINT, if you look at the brain
2640.84 before people get this, they
will have a temporal delay
2646.36 where the cingulate is
in front of the DLPFC.
2652.45 And in people that are
normal healthy controls,
2655.42 no depression, the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex is
2658.99 temporally in front of
the anterior cingulate.
2663.04 With effective treatment, we
can flip the timing of things
2668.11 so the dorsolateral is in front
of the anterior cingulate,
2672.16 just like in a normal person.
2673.96 - So you're not talking
2674.793 about obviously physically
moving these structures,
2676.48 you're talking about in
time, their activation.
2678.73 So in one case,
2679.87 it's like the coach telling
the player what to do.
2682.3 And the other is like a player
telling the coach what to do.
2685.057 And you restore order to the game.
2686.86 - You restore order to the game.
2688.21 And what it looks like is
depression, to your point,
2692.08 is a bunch of kind of spontaneous content
2695.35 that's semi-volitional that's
being kind of generated
2698.74 out of this conflict detection system.
2702.22 The cingulate seems to sense conflict
2706.48 and kind of feed that information,
2708.46 gets overactive in depression.
2710.92 And then in depression, it
looks like the left dorsolateral
2715.42 does not sufficiently clamp down on it.
2719.11 And what therapy appears to
do is to kind of restore that.
2723.31 What we see with TMS over that region is
2726.46 that we just exogenously
do the same sort of thing.
2728.98 We restore the governance
of the left dorsolateral
2733.24 over the cingulate area,
2735.22 and that is correlated
with treatment improvement.
2738.49 So the degree in which you can re-time,
2742.42 re-regulate in time the left dorsolateral
2745.45 over the cingulate,
2746.71 the more of an antidepressant
effect you have.
2750.04 - Can we therefore say in crude terms
2754.54 that the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex really is
2758.41 the governor of how we
interpret physiological signals
2761.5 and spontaneous thoughts?
2762.88 - It places a lens
2765.97 that the rest of the
brain sees things through.
2769.09 And you can do these experiments
2771.04 where you can put a normal
healthy control person
2775.03 in the scanner and you can make them feel
2777.64 like they have a loss of control
2779.62 and then you can see that
region come offline, right?
2782.83 So you can experimentally
manipulate the system,
2786.01 and so kind of buffing it up,
2788.5 it's like TMS is almost like
exercise for the brain, right?
2792.88 You're kind of exercising this
region over and over again
2795.88 with a physiologically relevant signal
2799.18 and kind of turning that system on.
2801.37 And what's interesting,
2803.05 I think really interesting
for this show is to, you know,
2806.11 we had a couple of folks, you know,
2808.33 probably five or six folks that
have actually told me this,
2810.25 where if they remit
early enough in the week,
2812.23 we have this very dense
stimulation approach
2814.45 where we can stimulate
people really rapidly
2817.45 over a five day block.
2819.07 We don't discriminate when they get better
2820.87 to when they stop.
2821.89 So if they get better on day one,
2823.81 we still give them the other four days
2825.4 because it's in the protocol to do that.
2826.627 And we can't, we're getting to a point
2828.58 where we can tell how
long it's going to take,
2830.56 but we're not there yet.
2832.18 And so, you know,
2833.29 every time somebody gets
better at day one or two,
2835.72 at the beginning when we first
started doing this, we'd say,
2837.52 you know, we're not sure, you know,
2839.41 we think this is safe to keep going,
2840.91 but you know, what do you want to do?
2842.8 And everybody was like,
no, I want to keep going.
2845.44 And so, you know, by Wednesday,
2847.63 they're like totally zeroed
out on the depression scales,
2850.33 you know, even better than
most people walking around.
2853.21 Like really no anxiety,
no depression or anything.
2856.0 By Thursday, the first
guy that told me this,
2859.27 he came in and he said,
2860.117 "You know, I was driving back to my hotel
2862.6 and I decided to go to the
beach and I just sat there
2864.94 and I was totally present
in the present moment
2867.79 for an hour."
2868.623 And he's like,
2869.783 "I read about this in
my mindfulness books,
2870.79 but I experienced it last night
2873.4 and I've never experienced
anything like this before."
2875.35 And I was like, hmm, that's interesting,
2877.27 but kind of wasn't sure.
2878.83 And then I didn't tell
obviously any more patients
2882.04 about that, and then about five
2883.3 over the last couple of years,
2884.83 when they remit early in the week,
2886.99 by the end of the week they're
like going to the beach
2889.15 and they're like totally
having what people describe
2891.79 as a pretty mindful present
moment sort of experience,
2895.96 which is really interesting,
you know, what that is.
2898.09 I mean, I don't have full on
scientific data to tell you,
2901.45 but it's just an
interesting anecdote, right?
2905.53 That folks, when you push
them through this point
2907.81 of feeling kind of clinically well
2910.87 that some people end up
reporting this additional set
2913.66 of features.
2915.37 - You mentioned the cingulate
2916.6 and the anterior cingulate in particular.
2919.63 Because now I feel like for
the first time in my career,
2922.0 I have some sense of
what prefrontal cortex
2924.64 might actually be doing
besides providing a bumper
2927.94 for the rest of the brain.
2932.11 The cingulate, it seems, is
a more primitive structure
2935.26 in the sense that ideally
it's under the regulation
2940.54 of this top down control
from prefrontal cortex,
2942.76 but what's mapped in the cingulate?
2944.62 And for the non neuroscientist
out there, when I say mapped,
2947.29 if we were to put someone in a scanner
2949.42 and focus in on cingulate or
put an electrode in there,
2951.94 what makes the neurons in there fire?
2954.04 What sorts of things in
the body and in the mind
2956.92 and out in the world light up,
for lack of a better phrase,
2961.12 the cingulate?
2961.953 What does the cingulate like?
2963.4 - Yeah, yeah, so that Stroop task,
2965.53 those incongruent word color associations,
2968.44 the dorsal part of that.
2971.8 For obsessive compulsive
disorder patients,
2974.26 certain kind of triggers.
2976.78 You'll see some of the neural
imaging studies will point
2979.57 to anterior cingulate.
2981.52 In the kind of very crude
psychosurgery world 50 years ago,
2984.88 the anterior cingulotomy was a way
2987.01 of treating obsessive
compulsive disorder, right?
2989.937 'Cause that area seems to
be overactive in people
2992.77 who are experiencing
obsessive compulsive disorder.
2995.44 You can kind of walk, the
cingulate wraps around, you know,
2999.55 this white matter track like
bundles, it wraps around that.
3003.27 And so there's a part that's above that,
3005.07 around that, and below that,
3007.29 and depending upon how much
of the conflict task has
3013.41 an emotional component,
3014.88 the more ventral and
subgenual that activation is.
3022.89 So the dorsal part of the
anterior cingulate seems
3027.06 to be kind of more of a pure cognitive,
3030.09 maybe obsessive compulsive
disorder sort of area.
3034.2 Whereas when you start getting
into mood sorts of triggers,
3037.11 like facial expression conflicts
where you're supposed to,
3042.207 you know, there's an emotional Stroop task
3044.22 where you show the word happy
3045.78 and then you have a face
of a person that looks mad,
3049.86 then that's another way
of having the same sort
3052.35 of Stroop conflict.
3053.7 That seems to be more perigenual,
subgenual areas, right?
3057.36 So you can kind of,
3058.56 you can trigger the
cingulate based off the level
3061.2 of emotional valence
from none down to a lot.
3065.1 And that seems to be how it's distributed.
3068.73 There are, you know, heart
rate kind of components to it
3071.19 and autonomic components in there too.
3073.32 There's something called akinetic mutism,
3075.418 you know, I'm a board
certified neuropsychiatrist,
3079.17 behavioral neurologist,
and I've seen, you know,
3081.87 a lot of these what we call
zebra cases in neurology
3084.42 where people have, you know,
3085.95 these unusual neurological presentations
3088.41 and one of them is akinetic mutism.
3090.84 So if you have a glioma sitting
3093.63 in the inner hemispheric fissure
3095.73 and kind of having
pressure on the cingulate,
3099.63 people can get into an almost
catatonic looking state
3102.27 where they kind of get
stuck and they don't speak.
3104.61 And so that tells you something
3106.38 about how the cingulate
works as well, right?
3110.07 It's like if it's not functioning,
3115.41 then people have a hard
time kind of connecting
3118.59 with reality.
3119.423 It seems to need to be constantly online
3123.54 to be able to interact
with the exterior world.
3125.97 - Is it involved in some
of the dissociative states
3128.25 that sometimes people
who are very stressed
3130.77 or depressed experience?
3132.39 You said catatonia being an extreme one,
3135.24 but I know someone for instance,
3136.89 that when they get really stressed,
3138.81 and it can even be if
someone yells at them
3142.92 or even if someone's angry with them
3145.59 or they perceive
someone's angry with them,
3147.18 there's a developmental backstory
3148.35 to why they likely feel this way,
3151.32 they sort of just kind of can't...
3153.54 This is a high functioning
individual normally,
3156.57 and they just sort of can't function.
3158.67 They can't complete
simple things like email
3160.8 or groceries or things for a short while.
3163.62 It's almost like a catatonia
3165.84 and they refer to it as
a dissociative state.
3170.67 Do you see that in depression?
3171.87 And I mean, we're speculating here
3173.52 as to whether or not that
involves a cingulate,
3175.14 but what you're saying holds
a lot of salience for me
3177.96 in thinking about this example.
3179.22 - Yeah, yeah.
3180.053 There's, so you see catatonia
as an extreme outcome
3184.05 of depression and sometimes schizophrenia
3187.05 and other illnesses.
3189.09 Dissociation is an extreme outcome,
3191.49 or even in some cases,
a less extreme outcome
3193.83 of PTSD and trauma.
3196.41 And you know,
3197.547 and it's also a phenomenon
that happens naturally
3201.06 in some people that are
highly hypnotizable.
3203.387 And so if you ask David Spiegel,
he'd say that, you know,
3206.58 some of the work that
he's been working on is
3208.35 around posterior cingulate in
the capacity to disassociate.
3212.43 But yeah, you know, with our
stimulation approach to DLPFC,
3217.92 dorsal anterior cingulate,
3219.42 one of the subscales
that moved the most was
3222.63 the dissociative subscale
for hypnotizability.
3226.44 So even in a normal individual, you know,
3229.59 you see that change
3231.3 in that kind of experience
of dissociation.
3234.6 - I am highly hypnotizable.
3236.85 David's hypnotized me a number of times.
3238.696 In fact, we have a clip of that
3239.57 on our Huberman Live clips channel.
3241.5 I've always, well, always.
3244.38 Starting at my early teens,
I started exploring hypnosis.
3247.11 I'm extremely hypnotizable.
3249.3 And self hypnosis or assisted hypnosis.
3254.068 I don't know that I ever go
into dissociative states.
3256.29 I'll try and avoid forcing you
3258.45 into running a clinical session right now,
3260.37 but to assess anything like that.
3262.62 But this brings about something
really interesting, I think,
3266.22 which is I'm aware that some
3268.77 of the more popular emerging
treatments for depression
3272.52 include things like ketamine,
3274.8 which is a dissociative anesthetic.
3276.96 Is that right?
- Yep.
3278.19 - And my assumption is that
as a dissociative anesthetic,
3282.48 that it leads to dissociative states
3284.4 where people can sort of
third person themselves
3286.8 and feel somewhat distanced
from their emotions.
3291.3 I've also been hearing that
there are emerging treatments,
3296.67 psilocybin being one of them,
but some other treatments,
3299.46 MDMA, et cetera, that we'll
parse each of these in detail,
3302.94 that lead to the exact opposite state
3305.16 during the effect of the drug,
3306.75 which is a highly engaged emotionality
3311.1 and heart rate and sense of self.
3313.98 And can also lead to relief of depression.
3316.71 Now, whether or not this, again,
3318.15 reflects that depression
is many conditions
3320.76 as opposed to just one,
3321.99 or whether or not somehow tickling
3324.63 or in some cases pushing really
hard on the opposite ends
3327.24 of the scale really matter,
I am absolutely fascinated,
3330.81 and again, also perplexed by this.
3333.24 Why would it be that a drug
that induces dissociative states
3337.56 and a drug taken separately
3339.51 that induces hyper-associative
states would lead to relief
3343.89 of the same condition?
3345.482 - Yeah, no, that's a great question.
3346.92 Yeah, so for ketamine, you know,
3350.25 the level of dissociation
appears to be correlated
3353.37 with the therapeutic effect.
3355.32 It appears to be necessary
but not sufficient
3358.92 to produce an antidepressant effect.
3360.99 And so folks that don't have
any psychological change
3367.08 from the ketamine or don't
experience any dissociation
3370.27 typically tend to have less
potent antidepressant effects
3375.24 from ketamine.
3376.29 We did a study a couple of years ago,
3377.73 it was really interesting.
3378.563 So we gave folks naltrexone,
3381.03 which is an opiate antagonist,
3383.43 mu and kappa opiate receptor antagonist.
3386.4 And we gave folk, the same individuals,
3389.82 a pill of that or a pill of placebo,
3392.37 and they had no idea which
one they were getting.
3394.17 - Was this low dose naltrexone?
3395.73 - [Nolan] 50 milligrams,
so it's pretty high dose.
3397.35 - Okay.
3398.183 - Yeah, and so we gave a typical
ketamine therapeutic dose,
3401.34 and then we gave 50 milligrams
of naltrexone or placebo.
3405.12 And then in the same individuals,
3406.95 we gave two infusions, one
with each of those conditions.
3411.267 And if they had an antidepressant effect,
3413.19 we waited until they relapsed
3414.96 and then we gave 'em the other condition.
3416.79 And then we looked to see what effect
3420.45 of blocking the opioid receptor,
3423.42 what effect would you see
3424.53 on the antidepressant effect
of blocking the opioid receptor
3426.78 with the idea that if
ketamine works the way
3429.3 that a lot of researchers
at the time thought that it,
3433.05 you know, completely worked in,
3434.1 which is the glutamate system,
3435.93 then you would have no
effect of naltrexone.
3439.32 'Cause naltrexone just interacts
with the opioid system.
3441.84 It doesn't do anything
with any other systems.
3444.39 Ketamine has a lot of
effects over, you know,
3447.27 it has clear opioid effects in mice
3450.66 in various ways of looking at that,
3452.94 and an MDA receptor antagonism
and glutamate effects.
3457.65 And so if it's just that
the glutamate part is
3461.7 the part driving the
antidepressant effect,
3464.04 you shouldn't have any difference
3466.32 in the antidepressant effect
between the two conditions.
3469.23 If, however, the antidepressant
effect is primarily is
3473.67 the opioid properties of
ketamine are necessary
3478.14 for the antidepressant effect,
3479.82 then you should have a loss
of antidepressant effect
3482.46 during the ketamine plus
naltrexone condition
3485.37 that you observed in the
ketamine plus placebo condition.
3489.0 And what we saw was that
there was a dramatic blockade
3494.55 of the antidepressant effect
when naltrexone was present.
3497.83 Yeah, in the people that
had an antidepressant effect
3503.31 with ketamine plus placebo alone.
3506.49 And then some friends of mine
did a TMS study with pain
3511.89 and they stimulated
3513.57 over the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex
3515.247 and they gave IV naloxone,
3517.23 which works basically the
same way as naltrexone,
3519.66 and they were able to block
the anti-pain effects of TMS
3523.89 with a opiate blocker.
3525.42 So this idea that another kind
of convergent point, right?
3529.5 This idea that the opioid
receptor may have a role
3533.4 in mood regulation.
3535.47 What's also interesting
is if you look at people
3537.51 that are getting a total knee operation,
3538.92 very painful operation, right?
3541.05 You know, total knee replacement
and you age, sex, you know,
3545.67 everything match the individuals
3547.35 that are going through that.
3548.4 But you have a group of people
that don't have depression
3550.827 and a group of people
that do have depression.
3553.14 The presence of depression triples
3554.97 the oral opioid dose by day four, right?
3559.47 - That's required.
3560.55 - That's required to cover the pain
3562.98 but what may be happening is
3564.21 it's not just treating physical pain,
3566.4 may be treating emotional
pain as well, right?
3568.53 At least transiently,
3570.36 it seems to have an antidepressant effect.
3572.85 Chronically, it seems to have
a very pro-depressant effect.
3575.55 It can make people treatment resistant.
3577.8 But, you know, it's an
interesting phenomenon.
3580.44 But yeah, the opioid system
seems to be pretty involved.
3583.92 But what's interesting there
with the ketamine trial is
3587.55 that we didn't see any
effect on the dissociation.
3590.97 And so the dissociation
was the same each time.
3594.75 So the psychological effect
of what we call the trip
3597.84 or the kind of dissociative effect
3600.12 where people are having a
psychological phenomenon
3602.4 from ketamine, that was
identical both times.
3606.18 And so it kind of, it
also challenged this idea
3610.41 that the psychological experience
3613.08 of the psychedelic effect
may be all that's necessary
3616.83 to produce an effect
3617.88 and that the pharmacology doesn't matter
3620.13 as long as you can achieve that state.
3622.56 And so, you know,
3623.46 we think we pretty
clearly debunked that idea
3626.46 that the underlying pharmacology
and the state, you know,
3631.59 seem to be important.
3633.51 We don't know for sure if you can,
3635.7 a lot of people are working on this,
3636.84 if you can take out, you know,
3638.43 essentially the psychological effect
3639.99 and still have a drug that
works to treat the illness
3644.22 that you're trying to target.
3645.3 And there was a mouse study out this week
3648.51 where they had an LSD analog
3650.49 and they were able to see
some animal level data
3654.93 to suggest that could be true.
3656.88 But until we figure that out in humans,
3658.53 it's kind of to be determined.
3660.69 But it is curious, right?
3662.79 Being able to kind of use
experimental manipulations
3666.39 to try to separate, you know,
some of these phenomenon apart
3670.59 and really understand what's doing what.
3673.08 - It's so critical
3673.98 and it's so critical to
the other conversation
3676.95 that we'll surely get to,
3678.09 which is the progression of psychedelics
3680.94 from illicit illegal drugs
to clinically validated,
3685.68 and presumably at some point,
3687.12 either decriminalized or legal drugs,
3689.52 which has not yet happened,
at least not in the US.
3693.3 But just to make sure that
people are getting this
3697.23 and how crucial this is.
3698.79 What we're really talking
about here is the fact that,
3702.662 you know, if somebody takes a
multi gram dose of psilocybin
3706.44 or somebody takes MDMA
or they take ketamine
3710.19 and they experience
relief from their trauma,
3712.02 their depression, their addiction,
3713.43 or any number of the other things
3714.69 that indeed those compounds
have be shown to be useful for
3717.03 in certain contexts, clinically
supported, et cetera.
3720.9 There's this like
gravitational pull to the idea
3723.84 that, oh, it was the hallucinations.
3726.06 It was the dissociative state.
3728.04 It was the feeling of connectedness.
3730.29 And what we're really saying is
3731.43 that while that certainly could be true,
3734.31 it may be the case that a major
source of the positive shift
3738.24 that occurs after the
effect of the drug is
3741.72 some underlying biology,
3743.1 like shifts in the mu opioid receptor,
3745.5 a la your experiments with naltrexone,
3747.81 or a change in the
underlying neuromodulation
3750.24 that had anywhere from nothing
3753.75 to something to do with the real shift.
3756.69 And I know there's a group up at UC Davis
3758.97 that published a paper in
nature about a year ago
3762.36 also looking at this is a
chemistry lab essentially,
3766.44 modifying psychedelics
3768.09 to remove the hallucinogenic properties,
3771.21 the mood altering properties,
3772.44 and actually seeing some
pretty impressive effects
3774.54 and shifts in mood after
the drug wears off.
3777.72 And I know this gets people
upset when they hear it.
3781.59 This gets a lot of people upset really.
3783.57 Because people think, oh no,
3785.01 it's the intense experience that matters.
3787.5 But in fact, that may
not be the case at all.
3792.24 In fact, it's so powerful for people
3794.79 that sometimes I liken it
in my mind to, you know,
3797.137 it's like the birth of a new child
3799.41 and it's such an incredible experience
3801.36 and then people feel so much connection.
3802.86 And then they sort of
connect the experience
3805.08 of the actual birth to the connection,
3806.88 when in fact they're,
that's true it turns out,
3808.95 but there are a bunch of
other things happening too.
3811.71 That's simply the reflection of the fact
3813.21 that you're holding a child
3814.23 and the pheromonal effects et cetera.
3815.79 So anyway, I think it's very important
3818.82 that these different
variables be figured out.
3824.31 Along those lines, I want to make sure
3826.2 that before we dive a bit deeper
3828.18 into ketamine and psilocybin,
3830.61 that we do touch on really important topic
3833.79 that has been in the press a lot lately,
3836.13 which is SSRI, selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
3839.1 'Cause we can't really have
a discussion about depression
3841.14 without talking about SSRIs.
3842.73 And then I want to circle back
to ketamine and psilocybin.
3846.78 It seems that there are now data
3850.14 that essentially state
that there's no direct link
3854.79 between serotonin levels and depression.
3858.48 Although my understanding is
3861.12 that the SSRIs are powerfully effective
3863.88 for certain forms of
obsessive compulsive disorder
3866.79 and may also be effective
for treatment of depression,
3869.43 but it may again be through
some effect unrelated
3872.28 to serotonin itself.
3873.57 Is that right?
3874.403 And how should we think about SSRIs?
3875.88 Are they useful, are they not useful?
3879.39 What's going on with
SSRIs in your patients
3881.85 and in other people as well?
3884.512 - Yeah, so the experiment
that I described a bit ago
3887.867 around the naltrexone and
ketamine was the first time
3892.38 I'm aware of where we were
able to essentially eliminate
3896.4 an antidepressant's effect
by using a second drug
3899.58 as a kind of a blockade.
3901.77 And it highlights a bigger issue, right?
3903.93 The issue that we haven't had a good way
3907.29 of really understanding
how these drugs work.
3910.8 And so it's the difference.
3912.33 I think a lot of the controversy there is
3914.88 that it's been been difficult, I think,
3918.15 for folks to see that
something can on one hand work
3924.39 and on the other hand, we
don't know how it works, right?
3927.99 And so SSRIs clearly work.
3931.92 You know, many, many meta analyses
3934.89 kind of proving that out, right?
3936.99 That in a subpopulation of individuals,
3939.18 they achieve great benefit
from depression, you know,
3943.2 for depression, for obsessive
compulsive disorder,
3946.53 for generalized anxiety
disorder, panic, you know,
3948.84 all these things,
3949.673 you can see an improvement
in those symptoms
3952.83 with what we call SSRIs
3954.96 or selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors.
3957.03 The issue there is
3958.92 that these selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors end up
3963.09 blocking the reuptake of serotonin
3965.76 and leaving the serotonin, you know,
3968.53 in this kind of in between,
between two neurons for a while
3974.46 and allowing for more
serotonin to kind of be there.
3977.46 The issue is that they don't
work immediately, right?
3981.96 So they don't work like the
same day you start taking them.
3985.41 And that suggests that
probably it's not exactly
3989.52 the serotonin being in there
that's directly driving it,
3993.06 that it's much more likely
that it may have some, say,
3996.59 brain plasticity effects, right?
3998.82 We know that things like brain
derived neurotrophic factor
4003.29 get upregulated with chronic
oral antidepressant use.
4007.58 And so that's kind of the idea
is that these things work,
4013.22 but what's powerful,
4014.69 and I think with the
authors of this paper,
4017.24 this extremely controversial paper,
4020.21 were in part trying to say was
4023.0 that there's not a deficit of serotonin.
4027.62 You're not born with what people
call a chemical imbalance.
4032.06 And psychiatry's known this.
4033.26 This is not actually new
information, anybody, you know,
4035.627 and it's kind of a rehashing
4038.18 of a bunch of information
we've known for a while now,
4040.37 but in the lay press,
4041.96 it's kind of hit in a
way that it didn't seem
4044.36 to grab attention before
with previous publications.
4049.28 But this idea that this chemical
imbalance idea is wrong.
4054.17 I really think that part's
important because I think that,
4059.24 you know, for a while, I think psychiatry,
4062.81 you know, what I'll call
psychiatry 1.0, right?
4066.23 This kind of idea of
Freud and psychotherapy
4068.84 and its origins.
4072.14 It was a lot around, you know, your family
4074.69 and those experiences and
psychotherapy kind of going in
4077.3 and correcting or helping
you to figure out,
4080.42 and you know, you being able to see,
4083.72 or people hear you so that
you can eventually come
4086.12 to the conclusion of certain cognitions
4089.75 that aren't helping you, right?
4091.28 And there's a huge importance there,
4093.62 but there's a history where, you know,
4096.62 things like the schizophrenogenic
mother and all of that,
4099.37 you know, that was a concept
at some point, right?
4101.27 And so we've transitioned
from that to, you know,
4104.78 for a long time the chemical imbalance,
4106.79 which I'll call psychiatry 2.0.
4110.06 You know,
4111.195 this idea that there's
something chemically missing
4114.71 and I think that the
trouble there for a patient
4120.86 who's not a physician,
4123.08 who's not someone who's steeped
in these sorts of ideas,
4129.77 who's, you know, more of kind of a person,
4134.69 kind of average American out there, right,
4136.82 is that it's sending a message
4139.43 of there's something missing with me,
4141.95 whether it be my experiences
I had no control over
4144.89 when I was a child or
a chemical in my brain.
4148.67 What I think is really powerful with TMS,
4153.2 you know, really powerful with TMS,
4155.867 and even powerful with
the psychedelic story is
4158.48 it's saying something different.
4160.76 You know, TMS works and
there's no serotonin coming in
4164.51 or out of the brain, right?
4165.92 And we're doing a rapid form of TMS
4168.17 that works in one to five days.
4169.88 There's no, it's very unlikely
4172.13 that there's some long
term kind of upregulation
4175.16 of serotonin that's driving that.
4176.78 So our work actually kind of pushes back
4179.24 on this serotonin hypothesis
4181.33 as being kind of the center of depression
4183.98 because it says, look,
4184.85 we're not giving anybody any serotonin.
4187.25 We're simply turning
these brain regions on
4189.89 and we're focused on the circuitry.
4191.99 And that's psychiatry 3.0.
4193.4 It's not just like neuromodulation.
4195.182 Neuromodulations are
really nice, you know,
4197.03 use case for psychiatry 3.0
4198.56 'cause it's a way to focally
4200.72 and directly perturb brain regions
4203.03 in whatever modality you're using.
4205.55 But you know, there are a lot of groups
4207.83 that are actually doing
neuroimaging before and after,
4210.08 and they're able to see
circuit level changes
4212.6 for something like psilocybin or ketamine
4215.69 long after the drug is gone, right?
4218.54 Suggesting in those same
brain regions converge,
4222.29 so the subgenual default
mode network connection
4224.54 that we see is changing
4226.19 with our Stanford neuromodulation
therapy technique.
4230.093 It's that same set of brain regions
4232.91 that ketamine and
psilocybin seem to act on,
4236.96 act on these connections
between brain networks
4240.29 that seem to shift.
4241.82 And so it refocuses the story
4244.64 on something that's highly correctable.
4248.24 And it's basically electrophysiology
4251.63 and it's basically kind
of recalibrating a circuit
4256.4 that is recalibrate-able instead
of I have something missing
4260.87 or I have some set of
experiences early in life
4264.941 that are going to forever trap me
4268.1 in these psychiatric diagnoses.
4270.35 And so it kind of challenges that idea.
4272.06 And I think that's what's so
powerful about psychiatry 3.0.
4276.53 This idea of focusing on the
circuit because it gets us
4280.1 into thinking about psychiatry
and psychiatric illnesses
4282.89 as something that are recoverable.
4285.44 People can get better.
4286.49 People, you know, we've seen
with our TMS techniques,
4289.1 we've seen with some of the
psychedelic work that we've done
4291.23 where people are actually
in normal levels of mood
4295.31 for sustained periods of time or-
4297.32 - Within five days.
4298.31 - Within five or less days.
4299.87 And in the case of the psychedelics,
4301.88 within a few days, right?
4303.02 So we can get people out of these states.
4306.17 They're totally well,
4307.55 there's no drug in their
system in that point,
4309.41 in the case of the psychedelics.
4310.52 It was never a drug in their
system, in the case of TMS.
4314.33 And it just tells us that it's fixable.
4317.96 It's just like the heart.
4318.95 It's just like an arrhythmia in the heart.
4321.5 It's just like, you know,
these other illnesses,
4323.78 that it's like a broken leg.
4325.1 We can go in and do something
4326.87 and we can get somebody better.
4328.49 Then I think what's empowering
4330.77 and what a lot of patients
have told me is they say,
4333.729 you know, some people will
relapse and need more stimulation
4337.61 or need more psychedelics
or whatever it is,
4339.86 but they'll tell me, I've
relapsed and I'm depressed again,
4344.36 but I'll never think
about killing myself again
4346.73 because I know that if I
go get stimulated again,
4351.5 it improves, it gets better.
4353.489 I will be able to
reachieve it and I can't.
4356.48 And I don't fear that
I'm chronically broken.
4359.51 I don't fear that the
chemical imbalance is
4362.54 still imbalanced.
4363.56 I don't fear that these
things that I couldn't control
4366.17 in my childhood, you know,
4367.79 are going to be there and
drive this problem forever.
4370.61 And I think that's what's
so powerful about this.
4373.76 - [Andrew] The sense of control.
4374.81 - The sense of control, the sense of...
4376.58 They're not doing the
stimulation themselves.
4378.74 They're not administering the drug
4380.42 in these trials themselves.
4381.47 And they probably never will.
4382.49 These will probably be medical treatments.
4384.53 But they are choosing to do it.
4386.42 And in that sense, they are in control.
4388.73 - Yeah, I have a good
friend, I won't out him
4391.46 for reasons that'll
become clear in a moment,
4393.17 who was quite obese and
lost a lot of weight
4398.39 and was really proud of himself.
4400.13 And then I guess we could
say he sort of relapsed
4402.47 in a sense.
4403.67 Not all the way, but far along.
4406.43 But his tone around it was very different.
4408.74 He knew he had accomplished
what his goal once before.
4412.37 He was disappointed in himself,
4413.78 but he knew exactly why he had relapsed.
4416.75 It was very clear.
4417.583 He had essentially relapsed
to the previous set
4419.78 of eating behaviors and
lack of exercise behaviors
4422.69 and has now brought himself back again.
4425.6 And it just resonates with
your story that, you know,
4429.86 once somebody understands they can do it
4431.63 because they've been there before,
4432.89 this idea again of considering
new rules, that there's...
4437.99 And that brings me to this
question about psychedelics
4441.2 and frankly the altered thinking
and perception that occurs
4445.149 in high dose psilocybin clinical sessions.
4451.16 It seems that the disordered thinking,
4452.84 even though it could be random, right?
4456.08 Hearing colors and seeing sounds is
4458.99 always the kind of cliche statement
4460.76 of the Timothy Leary area.
4463.85 Also, you know, right there,
that's a Stroop task of sorts.
4467.246 It's a synesthesia, it's a
combining of perceptions,
4469.79 but it's sort of Stroop task-ish
4472.28 in that it's a new set of rules
for the same stuff, right?
4476.93 And many people do report improvements
4481.88 in trauma related
symptomology and depression,
4485.21 as I understand it from my
read of the clinical trials,
4487.76 after taking psilocybin.
4488.9 Because during those sessions,
4490.07 something comes to mind spontaneously.
4493.46 As you and I were talking about
earlier, they will report,
4497.06 for instance, a new way
of seeing the old problem.
4501.14 And the old problem could be
the voice that they're no good,
4503.428 nothing will ever work out,
4504.95 or could be even more subtle than that.
4506.99 So that raises two questions.
4509.66 One is about the basic
functioning of the human brain,
4513.44 which is why do you think
the brain would ever hold on
4519.17 to rules that don't serve us well?
4522.65 That's one question.
4523.88 And then the second question is,
4527.06 what is it about psilocybin
and related molecules
4530.66 in terms of their neurochemistry,
4532.1 in terms of the ways they
disrupt thinking and feeling,
4535.07 et cetera, during the session
4537.59 that allow this novel rule
consideration phenomenon?
4544.01 - Yeah.
4544.91 So the first question,
4546.02 I think it's an evolutionary
neurobiology answer, right?
4551.39 I think that at the individual
person level, you know,
4555.5 it doesn't make a whole lot of sense
4556.91 that when we're really stressed out,
4558.11 some of us want to eat more, right?
4559.88 At the individual person level
4561.62 'cause it's like,
4562.453 that's not particularly
that good for my health
4564.44 in the long term.
4566.3 But if you think about it, like, you know,
4568.82 in some 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago,
4572.06 if I'm highly stressed out,
4573.62 it's most likely that I'm
about to not have food
4576.26 at some point and I
should eat a bunch of food
4578.21 that is high fat, high
sugar, high carb food
4580.88 to put on weight for that next phase
4584.54 where in this stress I may be in battle
4586.88 and I don't have food
4587.9 and I have enough fuel on board, right?
4590.24 And so we end up being a result
4595.13 of probably a lot of biology
that's not that useful
4597.74 in the modern era.
4599.12 And I think in the brain for,
say, let's say PTSD, right?
4603.41 A lot of veterans come back
4604.7 and they experience these PTSD symptoms
4606.41 and they're not at all
useful back home, right?
4610.85 You know, they hear some loud noise
4613.01 and all of a sudden they're behind a car
4614.66 or they're behind a, you
know, I've heard of folks,
4617.15 you know, jump and run behind a trashcan
4619.04 or whatever in the middle of San Francisco
4621.17 when they hear a loud noise.
4622.97 But if you put them
back in the battlefield.
4627.32 - [Andrew] Highly adaptive.
4628.153 - That's highly adaptive, right?
4629.18 And so I think what's
interesting is that we,
4637.07 in the absence of using
substances like psychedelics,
4642.2 end up having these
very persistent memories
4646.55 that are attached to
negatively balanced emotion,
4649.1 predominantly, as you were saying earlier,
4651.77 the jacket in elementary school, you know,
4654.638 I had various things like
that for me too, right?
4656.66 You remember these things.
4660.169 And we hold onto those things
4663.35 from I think an evolutionary
neurobiology standpoint,
4666.35 but what seems to, for whatever reason,
4670.1 kind of alleviate that
are these substances,
4675.11 some new like MDMA,
4677.33 some that have been around
for thousands of years,
4679.67 like psilocybin, and used as
a sacrament in traditions,
4689.51 seem to have a therapeutic effect.
4692.47 It seems to be pretty long
lasting for these phenomenon.
4695.27 And so it's just curious, right?
4697.61 It's curious that in the absence of that,
4702.71 these things will keep going on and on,
4704.72 but in the presence of that exposure,
4708.35 then all of a sudden you see
a resolution of the problem.
4711.59 And we have some work now
we're treating folks with,
4713.75 Navy SEALs, and the data's
still being analyzed.
4717.65 But the anecdotes that
we're getting, right,
4719.96 are folks are coming
back and they're saying
4721.829 it's finally gone, right?
4724.54 These set of PTSD
symptoms are finally gone.
4728.36 And so this idea that for whatever reason,
4731.36 going into what's probably
a highly plastic state
4734.06 like we were talking about earlier,
4735.08 upregulation of brain
derived neurotrophic factor
4737.27 in the case of ibogaine, glial
derived neurotrophic factor,
4741.29 this highly plastic state and the ability
4744.2 to kind of re-experience memories.
4747.77 And then as you know,
4749.419 we always reconsolidate a
memory when we bring it back up,
4753.95 we always reconsolidate it.
4754.783 But reconsolidating it in that
state, for whatever reason,
4759.05 may drive a therapeutic effect.
4762.71 And, you know, the jury's still out.
4767.39 I would say that I'm kind of an agnostic
4772.13 to what tool I'm using kind of guy.
4775.13 Like my business is to find
treatments that help people.
4780.02 And so I'm much more like
pragmatic about it, you know.
4783.71 If this sort of thing, which
has a lot of cultural baggage,
4789.8 but if this sort of thing
4790.85 ultimately ends up being therapeutic,
4792.47 if we can design trials
that convince me and others
4795.35 that it is, then we
should absolutely use it.
4798.08 You know?
4798.913 And if it doesn't, then we
clearly shouldn't use it, right?
4804.14 And I think that's a big question
4806.87 the field's going to have to work out.
4808.07 We have a hard time blinding these trials
4810.11 because the placebo condition is not easy
4813.23 to pull off, obviously.
4815.33 - A placebo for a psilocybin
journey is hard to imagine.
4820.419 - We've got, you know, we've
been thinking about this
4822.05 and maybe that ketamine study
4824.51 that I was talking about earlier,
4825.47 if we could give people
naltrexone and ketamine,
4828.26 maybe that's a good sort of
placebo condition, right?
4832.747 'Cause we know that we can block any
4834.8 of the actual antidepressant
effects of ketamine,
4836.81 they still have an experience, you know.
4838.367 And so that's one way of doing it.
4840.47 But thinking about ways to do that
4841.817 and really kind of proving this out.
4843.86 And that's been, yeah,
4846.32 I think that's been kind of central
4848.03 to the way I've been thinking about this.
4850.4 But yeah, I think there's the
work that's been done so far,
4853.22 the first psilocybin trial,
4855.17 the first MDMA trial was published
4857.81 in "Nature Medicine" recently.
4859.82 - And what do those generally say?
4861.17 I mean, that they are effective
for a number of people
4864.29 after one session, two sessions?
4866.72 What's sort of the general contour of?
4868.37 And let's start with psilocybin and MDMA.
4871.31 - Yeah, so MDMA appears to,
in one to a few MDMA sessions,
4876.95 have an anti PTSD effect
that seems to be, you know,
4881.69 outside of the kind of
standard assumed levels
4886.07 of PTSD improvement that you
can observe in individuals
4889.52 with this level of PTSD, right?
4891.35 So what we call the effect size,
4893.15 which is essentially like a effect size,
4898.64 the measure that allows for you
4899.96 to compare different
treatments to each other
4902.51 for different conditions
that are, you know, agnostic
4904.64 to what the actual illness is.
4906.68 You know, the effect
size is there, you know,
4909.89 approach effect size is the
things that are pretty effective
4912.77 like antacids for heartburn, right?
4915.8 And you see that with MDMA treatment.
4919.07 - So does that mean that
for people that have trauma,
4922.77 and again, we're talking
about in a clinical setting,
4925.58 they take a one or two doses of MDMA.
4928.4 I think the standard maps
dose is 150 to 175 milligrams.
4932.42 Again, doing this with
a physician, et cetera,
4934.28 control clinical trial, legal.
4937.22 - [Nolan] Yep, exactly.
4938.18 - They do it once or twice.
4940.28 And broadly speaking,
4942.11 what percentage of people
who had trauma report
4944.6 feeling significant relief
from their trauma afterward?
4948.74 - It's about 2/3 of people had
4950.3 a clinically significant
change in their PTSD.
4955.55 - That's impressive.
4956.383 - [Nolan] Which is impressive, right?
4957.38 - And how long lasting was that?
4958.723 I mean, these trials were
ended pretty recently, so...
4961.35 - Yeah, it appears to last for a while.
4963.14 In the earlier trials where
they followed people out,
4965.09 it seemed to last for
kind of in the years range
4967.34 for some people.
4968.173 And so it's, you know,
it's pretty compelling.
4972.11 Psilocybin, you know, and
contrast that with ketamine,
4975.74 which only on average lasts
about a week and a half
4978.23 for a single infusion,
so it's a much shorter.
4981.8 - So they have to get
repeated infusions of ketamine
4983.84 every 10 days or so?
4986.57 Forever?
4987.83 - For some people, or they end up getting
4989.42 like a bunch of doses
for a couple of weeks.
4992.99 And then for some people
that seems to last a while.
4997.277 You know, that's where I
think the psilocybin story
4999.65 for depression and the
MDMA story for PTSD seemed
5003.07 more interesting to me.
5004.18 - So for psilocybin, what
is the rough percentages on,
5008.05 and this would be relief not from trauma,
5009.64 but from depression, correct?
5011.47 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
5012.76 So it's, you know, in open label studies,
5014.68 it's closer to like half
to 2/3 of people end up
5017.14 getting better depending upon their level
5018.58 of treatment resistance.
5019.916 In the blinded trials it was
more like 1/3 or so of people,
5023.95 you know, experienced relief.
5025.9 And this is, you know, this is
a press release of the data,
5029.767 you know, and so it
hasn't, to my knowledge,
5031.78 it hasn't been published yet.
5033.1 And so I'm looking forward
to seeing the full paper
5035.44 on that one.
5036.273 But it, you know, separated from placebo
5039.76 and looks pretty good as well.
5042.04 It looks like it's, you know,
5043.57 the first of two trials
that need to be done
5045.43 to get this thing approved
5047.05 for treatment resistant depression.
5048.52 And so that stuff looks good.
5052.81 - In terms of MDMA, for
many years it was reported
5057.16 in the popular press
5058.15 and there was a paper published in science
5059.503 that MDMA was neurotoxic,
5061.63 that it would kill serotonin neurons.
5063.73 This was what was always said.
5065.62 Then I saw another paper
published in science
5069.07 that wasn't a retraction
of the previous paper,
5071.44 but rather was a second
paper in the same group
5073.69 that essentially admitted
that the first time around,
5077.02 they had injected these
monkeys with not MDMA,
5082.66 but with methamphetamine, which
is known to be neurotoxic.
5085.96 So it was kind of a
public admittance of oops
5089.44 or like really big screw up, so oops,
5093.91 but never a retraction
5095.38 and then never really a
publicly acknowledged correction
5099.22 in the popular press.
5101.32 So it seems that in the
appropriate dosage range,
5104.71 and with these one or two sessions,
5107.8 my assumption, and this
again is an assumption,
5111.16 tell me if I'm right or wrong here,
5112.93 is that MDMA is not neurotoxic
for serotonergic neurons
5117.64 at appropriate doses and
with appropriate sourcing,
5119.77 et cetera.
5120.603 - So it was an interesting study that,
5123.61 I think the guy's name is
Halpern, last name's Halpern.
5126.79 - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern.
5127.78 - Not, different Halpern.
5129.19 I think Joshua Halpern,
5130.39 I'm blanking on his first name, but...
5132.7 - Casey Halpern was a
guest on this podcast
5134.607 and is a former colleague
of ours at Stanford,
5136.78 who unfortunately we lost to
University of Pennsylvania
5139.63 and maybe someday we'll bring him back.
5142.24 - Yeah, that's right.
5143.073 So this individual, you know,
5145.18 received some NIH funding
to actually, NIDA, you know,
5148.12 National Institute for Drug Abuse funding
5150.07 to explore individuals of
the Mormon faith in Utah
5157.96 who partake in only MDMA.
5162.82 So the way this works is
5166.27 that MDMA happened kind of after a lot
5172.15 of the religious documents were developed.
5175.6 And so MDMA isn't on the
prohibited drug list.
5179.56 - The banned substance list.
5180.924 - [Nolan] The banned substance list.
5182.167 - I have some good friends who are LDS.
5183.4 - Yeah, great people.
5184.837 I do as well, you know,
5187.09 just a kind of set of facts, you know.
5188.86 And so these folks only
use MDMA but they don't,
5195.22 they're not, you know,
5196.06 the problem with some people using drugs,
5197.92 they're poly substance users, right?
5199.9 So you can't say it's the MDMA
5202.33 if they've also taken other psychedelics
5204.13 and they've taken opiates
and they've taken cocaine,
5205.96 and you have this picture
5207.28 where you can't really
tease out that problem.
5210.916 But with this, right,
5212.32 it was just individuals that
were part of the Mormon faith.
5215.38 And so they were kind of purist
5218.26 in the sense they only used MDMA
5220.03 and he confirmed all of that.
5221.89 And it was a brilliant study, right?
5224.62 Because then he was able to go in
5226.18 and look at their cognitive profiles
5228.19 versus individuals of the same
geography, the same faith,
5232.18 all of that, that
happened to not take MDMA
5235.6 and found there were no
neurocognitive differences.
5239.47 - So does that mean that
it was not damaging?
5242.74 - It was not damaging.
5243.88 It's hard to know because to
really do this study well,
5247.78 you'd have to track these folks down
5249.4 before they ever took
MDMA and do a pre-post
5252.76 and compare to people that didn't.
5254.68 But, you know, this is
about as good of a study
5256.9 as you can do, given the situation,
5261.07 to be able to check this out.
5263.98 Additionally, when I
was back in Charleston
5265.99 and working in the Medical
University of South Carolina,
5268.75 one of my mentors there, Dr. Wagner,
5273.67 was a neuropsychologist at MUSC
5276.167 and he was also the neuropsychologist
5278.29 for the early MDMA trials.
5280.48 And so he did all the
neurocognitive batteries
5283.15 for individuals pre-post
5285.34 and similarly did not see any changes
5288.4 in neurocognitive profiles
in a negative way.
5291.31 And so, you know,
5293.14 there's data from experimental
patients receiving this.
5295.66 There's data from people
that are chronic users,
5298.3 you know, who only take MDMA.
5301.66 And that combination of data suggests
5306.49 that there's certainly no apparent risk
5310.18 in the kind of one to
two to three dose range.
5313.39 And it's probably unlikely
that at least, you know,
5317.47 modest dose exposure over
a lifetime doesn't appear
5321.25 to have a profound neurocognitive
damaging effect, yeah.
5326.65 - Interesting.
5327.49 Yeah, I know that sourcing
is key and we're here,
5330.67 we're talking about clinical
trials where purity is assured.
5334.3 And you know,
5335.35 years ago when so-called
raves were really popular,
5338.14 maybe they're still
popular, never been to one,
5340.24 so wouldn't know if
they're happening or not.
5343.09 That's how in the know I am.
5345.16 But it was clear that, you know,
5347.68 testing for purity was important
5349.09 because sometimes the drugs are made
5354.34 such that there are contaminants
like methamphetamine,
5357.55 which we know is highly neurotoxic.
5360.13 I think that one reason why people think
5362.56 that MDMA might be neurotoxic
is the reported drop in energy
5367.66 or sort of feeling fatigued
for a few days afterward.
5370.33 I spoke to a physician colleague of ours
5372.22 who said that that very
likely has something to do
5375.79 with the surge in prolactin
that arrives subsequent
5380.11 to the big dopamine surge
that occurs in MDMA.
5383.53 And I mention that because I
know a number of people talk
5386.77 about serotonin depletion
after taking MDMA.
5390.34 He has it in mind that
while that could be true,
5392.77 it's likely that anytime
somebody takes something
5394.99 or does something where there's
a huge lift in dopamine,
5397.99 that there's very likely a
huge compensatory increase
5400.78 in prolactin that follows
5401.89 and prolactin has a
kind of sedative effect,
5404.11 numbing effect on mood
and libido, et cetera,
5406.93 that eventually also wears off.
5408.79 Does that make sense
to you as a physician?
5410.71 - Yeah, it makes sense.
5411.543 I mean, you know,
5412.376 the difference between,
say, MDMA and psilocybin is
5415.6 that MDMA is kind of an
amphetamine of sorts, right?
5417.85 So it has effects in dopamine
5420.46 and psilocybin's, you
know, pretty neutral,
5424.51 and you know, maybe a little
bit of dopamine effects,
5426.76 but kind of much more of a
serotonergic focused drug.
5430.42 And so yeah,
5431.65 I think you're going to see kind
of a different profile after.
5434.17 And that makes, I
haven't heard that story,
5435.76 but that makes sense to me too.
5438.25 - Since you mentioned psilocybin,
let's talk a little bit
5440.02 about the neurochemistry of psilocybin.
5441.193 As a serotonergic agent, my
understanding is it operates
5445.21 on these, is it the 5HT
serotonin 2C receptor?
5450.07 - 2A.
- 2A, excuse me.
5451.35 2A and receptors.
5453.37 And that I've seen a
bunch of different reports
5455.62 in terms of what it's
actually doing to the brain
5457.42 while people are under
the effects of the drug.
5459.61 And this is important
for us to segment out
5461.62 because there are the effects that happen
5463.24 while people are under the influence
5464.65 and then the more long lasting effects.
5466.9 But some of the effects I've
heard about are, for instance,
5469.48 and tell me again if
these are right or wrong,
5473.02 that there is increased
activation of lateral connection,
5478.09 sort of broader areas of
the brain being coactive
5481.03 than would normally occur.
5483.04 Maybe that explains some of
the synesthesias, you know,
5485.5 seeing sounds and hearing colors
5487.9 and that as the trivial example,
5489.55 but rule breaking within the mind.
5494.29 But then I've also heard that
perhaps it's lack of gating
5498.76 of sensory input.
5499.66 So normally if I'm looking at something,
5501.25 I'm not thinking about the
sensation in my right toe
5503.86 unless it's relevant.
5506.08 But if I'm thinking about the
sensation in my right toe,
5508.0 I'm generally not thinking
5508.87 about the truck around the corner.
5509.95 So we have these attentional spotlights,
5511.78 but that somehow it creates
a more, it adds spotlights.
5516.0 - Yeah, degates the thalamus.
5517.383 - Degates the thalamus, right,
5518.95 through the particular thalamic structure.
5521.56 So what is the evidence
that any of that is true?
5525.61 And are there other phenomena?
5527.56 Is there involvement of
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
5529.75 that we are aware of?
5530.86 And what I'm really headed
here in a few minutes is,
5534.67 you know, is there a place
5536.44 for combining directed
stimulation of the brain
5539.59 with psychedelics so that the effects
5541.63 of serotonin could be
primarily within the structures
5546.25 that you know from your work
to be relevant to depression.
5549.61 So, but to simplify it first,
5551.11 what's going on when one takes psilocybin
5553.3 and why is it interesting
in light of depression?
5556.78 - Yeah, definitely.
5557.613 So David Nutt and Robin
Carhart-Harris' work
5562.66 around neuroimaging
psychedelics are kind of
5564.883 some of the first folks to do that work.
5567.58 And to their great surprise,
5570.13 they thought there was going
to be an increase in activity
5572.86 on psychedelics and what they
found is the opposite, right?
5575.02 There's kind of an overall decrease
5577.06 in the level of activity in
the brain with psychedelics,
5580.93 but they've also looked at connectivity
5583.69 and there's this kind of
small world, you know,
5586.27 large world connectivity
that you think about.
5588.88 And so, you know, small world meaning
5590.92 there's kind of a much
more kind of focused
5593.86 kind of cortical function
5595.0 or, you know, sub-cortical
function or whatever it is.
5597.67 And what you see is a difference
5600.443 in that level of engagement
of brain regions,
5605.02 the connectivity, kind
of global connectivity,
5607.24 to your point, kind of increases.
5609.37 And so, you know, it's
interesting, you know,
5612.513 I think to kind of have a
conversion theory on this.
5616.09 It's still, you know, to be determined.
5618.7 There's still a lot of work I
think that needs to be done.
5621.43 But it's certainly suggestive
5624.85 that there's pretty profound
changes in brain activity
5629.26 and brain connectivity after.
5631.39 And what we've found to
be really interesting is
5633.823 that the anti-depressant
effects of psilocybin have
5638.8 a particular connectivity change
5642.43 that we also see with our
TMS approaches, right?
5645.94 And it's this connectivity
5647.74 between the subgenual anterior cingulate
5650.08 and the default mode network.
5651.94 And so when we do
5653.14 this effective Stanford
neuromodulation therapy stimulation,
5656.8 we see a down regulation, the
connectivity between them,
5660.34 negatively balanced mood state
5662.17 in the case of depressed individuals
5663.88 and the self-representation of the brain.
5666.31 And you see that same
connectivity change occur
5669.46 post-psilocybin, you know,
5671.86 suggesting there's a convergent mechanism
5673.93 and it makes sense, right?
5674.83 You've kind of got
5675.79 an overconnected,
negatively balanced system,
5679.33 conflict system that's kind of attached
5683.08 onto the self representation
and people feel stuck, right?
5687.22 And then when you do whatever
you do that's effective,
5689.89 it unpairs those two systems.
5693.19 - I want to ask you about this
phenomenon I've heard about
5697.24 during psilocybin journeys.
5698.5 I heard about this from
Dr. Matthew Johnson,
5700.87 who's running a lot of the
clinical trials at Johns Hopkins
5704.89 and has been a guest on this podcast.
5707.23 He said that there's something
seems to be important
5711.31 about the patient who's depressed
5713.74 or who's under the influence of psilocybin
5716.92 or the patient who's
trying to get over smoking
5719.23 or an eating disorder
who's taking psilocybin
5721.45 and is in the clinic.
5723.55 That there's something important
5724.72 to this notion of letting go,
5727.45 that people will feel as if their thoughts
5730.6 and their feelings
5731.433 and maybe even their body
aren't under their control,
5733.852 and that the clinicians' job
under those circumstances is
5736.78 of course to make sure that
they're physically safe
5738.4 so they don't jump out a window or try...
5740.29 Actually give an example of
a patient who thought that,
5742.93 I think it was a she,
5743.763 could move into the painting in the wall,
5746.02 and obviously that wasn't
true in the real world,
5748.63 although it was true in her mind.
5749.89 So they prevented her from doing that.
5751.9 But that letting go,
5753.19 that somehow untethering
from the autonomic arousal
5758.11 that's occurring is important.
5761.05 Which brings us back to this
idea or me back to this idea
5763.81 of like a seesaw where
you're sort of letting go
5766.39 of the hinge and just sort of,
your heart rate's going up,
5769.57 like just go with it and trust, you know?
5771.88 Your heart rate's going down,
just go with it and trust.
5773.89 You're thinking about
something very powerful
5776.95 and depressing related to your childhood,
5779.23 you're just supposed to
go there without fear.
5781.57 You're thinking about what's possible
5783.19 in terms of what could happen.
5784.42 So anyway, you get the picture.
5788.89 Can we think of that
5789.76 as just the willingness to do
a million different variations
5795.13 on the emotional Stroop task?
5796.93 You know, you'll entertain
the full array of rules
5801.19 within your head and consider them.
5803.35 Or is there something more to it?
5805.15 You know, and again,
5806.606 we're in the outer margins
of understanding here,
5810.13 but what are your thoughts
on this notion of letting go
5813.58 as such a key variable
for relief from depression
5817.24 during the psychedelic journey?
5818.47 - Yeah, so I'll talk a little bit
5820.12 about something called exposure
5821.35 and response prevention therapy,
5822.82 that's a typical kind of gold
standard treatment for OCD,
5826.45 and I'll help this a
little bit conceptually.
5830.35 And so what that really is,
it's a letting go therapy.
5834.25 And so, you know, exposure
response prevention,
5838.09 the idea is that you have
to expose the individual
5842.29 to something that, you know,
5844.84 something that triggers an obsession
5847.0 that they then want to do
whatever the compulsion is, right?
5850.477 And so I'll give you, you know,
5851.68 my first exposure and
response prevention patient
5855.1 when I was a resident,
5856.69 he was very concerned about
leaving the lights on his car.
5862.3 And so what we did is we went out
5866.494 and we turned the lights on in
his car and locked his door.
5870.58 So his lights were on,
5871.81 and he was super worried, this
is going to kill his battery.
5874.96 And we went and we spent an
hour talking about things,
5877.987 and we went back out to his
car and his battery was fine,
5882.04 and his lights were on.
5883.84 And he cranked the car and we
did it maybe one other time,
5888.01 and then all of a sudden
that was gone, right?
5890.95 And that's the idea is that, you know,
5892.78 you're essentially exposing.
5894.67 And you want to do it at levels
5896.08 that are, from an anxiety
standpoint, tolerable,
5900.1 but exposing the person to something
5902.08 and then letting them see
5904.0 that that exposure ends
up being fine, right?
5907.57 It ends up not causing the thing
5909.25 that they end up being worried about.
5912.76 And so, you know, in some sense,
5914.95 being in the psychedelic state,
5916.87 and we are all taught at a level
5920.44 to retain some level of control.
5923.29 You know, people have
more or less of that,
5926.77 but we're all effectively
retaining some level of control.
5930.58 We all wake up in the
morning and put clothes on
5932.71 to go into society.
5933.82 We all try to say, you know,
5935.89 most people try to say the right things.
5938.71 They don't try to do things
5940.0 that are outside of cultural norms
5942.31 when they're in conversation.
5943.69 And so we're constantly
5945.85 at some level controlling
the situation that we're in.
5948.82 And so it's, you know, it's not,
5951.04 it makes a lot of sense
that in that state,
5954.19 part of the therapeutic effect
5956.11 that may be linked to the
neural circuitry is this idea
5959.59 of letting go and essentially
letting the system, you know,
5964.48 the network configuration
maybe, whatever it is,
5968.23 assume a state
5969.7 that you've essentially been
fighting the whole time.
5973.57 The same way that my OCD
patient was fighting this need
5979.21 to click the off button on
the lights of his car 50 times
5984.79 before he would go and do
whatever he needed to do.
5988.33 And in some level, letting go there,
5990.07 meaning letting us just turn the lights on
5992.23 and him not do anything,
5994.18 or letting go meaning in
the psychedelic state,
5996.28 you're just letting go
5997.84 of whatever it is you're holding onto,
5999.94 negatively balanced
thoughts about yourself
6003.21 in the setting of having depression
6005.88 or, you know, re-experiencing
a trauma memory
6011.28 and allowing that to just happen
6013.17 and seeing it again
through a different light.
6017.04 You know, it feels the same
6018.08 in the sense that that's
allowing for whatever's going on
6021.78 with these psychedelic states
to do whatever they do.
6024.9 - It's fascinating.
6026.04 You said it's exposure response therapy is
6028.457 the traditional name?
6029.29 - [Nolan] Exposure response
prevention therapy.
6031.03 - Prevention therapy.
6031.863 Done outside of the psychedelic journey.
6034.56 - It's done outside the
psychedelic journey.
6036.39 But that idea of letting go
is present in both of those.
6040.74 You know, psychotherapy
kind of straight up,
6044.34 totally sober, non psychedelic,
6046.53 non anything psycho manualized,
6048.99 that psychotherapy that we
know works really well for OCD.
6052.44 And then, you know, in
that psychedelic state,
6054.87 and so people have done
studies with psilocybin,
6058.59 and now there's some studies
with MDMA trying to look
6061.02 at treating OCD, you know,
6064.44 with this same sort of
idea of letting go, right?
6068.13 And how do you have an OCD
patient kind of let go?
6071.34 Maybe even letting go of not
washing their hands anymore,
6074.49 you know, kind of accepting the idea
6076.68 they're not going to
get germs in their hands
6078.81 or whatever it is, you know?
6079.727 And so it's kind of part and parcel,
6081.75 that same sort of thinking.
6083.79 - When I was in college,
6084.63 I developed a compulsive superstition.
6087.0 I'm not afraid to admit this.
6088.11 I somehow developed a
knock on wood superstition.
6092.01 And I was actually kind of ashamed of it
6095.67 because it rationally made no sense.
6098.43 I don't consider myself
a superstitious person,
6100.59 never was a superstitious kid.
6102.66 You know, I'd step on the sidewalk cracks,
6104.619 I'd walk under ladders, you know,
6106.677 I'd probably even try
to walk under a ladder,
6109.71 even though I don't suggest it.
6112.08 But somehow I picked this thing up
6113.94 and I used to sneak it at times.
6117.09 I told my girlfriend at
the time that I had it
6118.62 in hopes that that would
prevent me from doing it.
6121.56 And it's tricky.
6122.61 Sometimes it actually comes
back where I think, gosh,
6124.56 I didn't say, you know, knock on wood,
6126.15 I didn't knock on wood, I hope
that doesn't actually happen.
6128.675 And it's quote unquote crazy, right?
6131.4 But crazy in the sense that
it makes no sense rationally
6134.43 why the events would be linked.
6136.29 And yet I think a lot of
people out there do have
6138.51 internal superstitions.
6141.03 Maybe by talking about
it now, it'll go away.
6143.82 Clearly I just need to challenge it.
6145.675 You know, anyway, I mention
it because I consider myself,
6149.46 you know, generally rational person,
6151.08 but it's interesting how these
motor patterns get activated
6155.94 and this notion of letting go,
6157.62 because I don't actually
know what consequence I fear.
6161.4 And the fear, as I was
hearing the example you gave,
6163.627 you know, the fear of the
car battery running down,
6165.57 I was about to say,
6166.403 "Well, what if the battery
actually did run out?"
6168.0 Then the therapy would be undermined.
6169.77 And yet that could also
be interesting too,
6171.84 because it's not that big of a deal.
6173.1 You jump the car.
6174.42 But in my case,
6175.253 I need to think about
what the ultimate fear is.
6178.23 - Yeah, and you know, I
think a lot of people,
6181.14 so it's interesting if you
look at, say, the OCD scale
6184.53 or the depression scale or whatever,
6186.48 we don't define normal as zero.
6188.94 We define normal as
some number range above.
6194.07 So zero to, in the case
6196.32 of the Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale,
6199.56 one of the depression
scales we use, 10, right?
6202.41 That's the normal range.
6203.64 And so people could have some sadness
6206.25 and still be considered normal.
6207.72 In the case of the OCD scale,
it's about the same 10, right?
6210.33 Where we say it's kind of
starts to be, you know,
6213.93 mildly abnormal or something.
6216.03 And I'd always tell the medical students,
6218.107 "Look, my friends that
are surf instructors,
6220.8 they're more like a zero on the Y bar.
6222.78 People that are professionals,
you know, they're non-zero,
6226.26 but it's still within the normal range."
6228.81 And especially, you know,
6229.98 in the case that you're talking about,
6231.96 it doesn't sound like it got in your way.
6233.55 It doesn't sound, I mean,
6234.383 you're obviously highly
successful tenured professor
6237.57 at Stanford and do all the
great things that you do.
6242.151 And so it's very much kind
of within the normal range,
6245.22 and I think totally assumed
6249.63 that a lot of people have
these sorts of things.
6252.15 And as long, I think something
as a psychiatric diagnosis
6255.87 when it severely impairs
your ability to function
6259.44 and that's when we kind
of cross that threshold.
6262.71 But, you know, I think
that a lot of people,
6265.65 and it's great that
you're bringing this up.
6267.0 I mean, it's very anti-stigmatizing
6268.74 that you're bringing up, right?
6269.58 Because I think a lot of
people hold that stuff in
6272.28 and they don't want to talk
about it because they're worried
6275.31 that somebody else may think something.
6276.99 But the reality is, as a psychiatrist,
6279.42 I talk to a lot of patients,
6281.43 a lot of people that are,
you know, family members,
6283.86 you know, folks that are just going
6286.17 through a death in the
family, whatever it is.
6288.849 And what you figure out is like,
6289.71 everybody's got a little
something here and there.
6292.38 Everybody has the knock in
some way, if that makes sense.
6295.2 And it's just, and we're all
just kind of more predisposed
6299.64 not to talk about it.
6300.63 But I think it's
important to talk about it
6302.79 because I think that when we
start all talking about it,
6305.31 then we realize that we're
all kind of in this together
6308.22 in a way.
6309.12 And then some folks that
have to knock 100 times,
6314.91 we call that OCD, you know,
6317.52 and they're worried about germs
and all these other things.
6320.37 We call that OCD.
6321.99 And then in that circumstance, you know,
6324.45 they need treatment, right?
6325.68 But it is really on,
6327.3 just like blood sugar,
just like blood pressure,
6329.46 it's on a range, you know,
6330.99 and it's not just these
discreet diagnoses.
6333.09 You have them or you don't.
6334.8 - It's good to know.
6336.366 I actually feel some
relief just hearing this,
6337.793 because I am slightly...
6339.87 I wouldn't say ashamed as
sort of embarrassed by it,
6341.79 but I offer it as a, you know,
6346.11 it is what it is, as they say.
6348.18 And it certainly doesn't
seem to hinder my life much,
6352.53 knock on wood.
6354.089 - [Nolan] [laughs] Nice.
6354.922 - So if we could talk
a bit about ibogaine.
6358.088 I don't know much about ibogaine,
6360.51 although anytime I hear
the, you know, A-I-N-E,
6362.97 you know, lidocaine, ibogaine,
I think of an anesthetic.
6367.41 And going to the dentist,
6368.52 which is an unpleasant
experience for me, generally.
6373.53 What is ibogaine?
6375.81 Does this have anything to
do with the so-called toad?
6379.41 You know, people talk about
smoking frog skin, toad skin.
6384.18 What is it used for clinically?
6386.16 Is it legal in the US as a clinical tool?
6391.08 Who's using it and for what purposes?
6394.38 If you could educate me on ibogaine,
6395.73 I truly know nothing about it,
6397.38 except I think I know how
to spell it correctly.
6399.27 - Yeah, that's fair, yeah.
6400.56 So ibogaine is one of the alkaloids
6406.38 that you can extract from
a iboga tree root bark
6412.14 that's typically growing in
the country of Gabon, Africa.
6419.82 So Gabon is one of the
West African countries,
6425.13 kind of middle of Africa
and on the west coast.
6429.15 And Gabon has a group of folks, you know,
6437.55 called the Bwiti.
6439.56 It's a religious kind of sacramental group
6443.52 that sacramentally uses iboga root bark
6448.65 as part of the sacrament.
6452.37 And they've been using iboga
root bark for a very long time.
6458.945 And it's, you know, part of the tradition.
6461.31 There's a whole set of
kind of ceremony around it.
6466.14 If you're interested in this,
6467.19 there's a book called
"Breaking Open the Head"
6469.17 by Daniel Pinchbeck that goes through
6471.84 and talks about this whole process.
6474.78 But essentially the Gabonese
have been using this
6478.11 for a long time and it's a kind
of an atypical psychedelic.
6484.216 It's not a psychedelic that
we normally think about
6489.48 with psilocybin and LSD
6490.77 where there are visual
perceptual changes, right?
6493.32 So if you take psilocybin or LSD,
6496.53 what you experience is you experience
6499.21 these kind of visual
perceptual differences
6502.71 in the external world, right?
6504.117 And on enough LSD or psilocybin,
6506.52 an individual can actually
perceive something visually
6510.18 in the external world that isn't there,
6512.46 as we talked about earlier.
6515.01 Ibogaine doesn't do that.
6516.51 Ibogaine does something different.
6517.92 It's kind of like, have you
ever seen "Minority Report,"
6520.68 you know, the movie with Tom Cruise,
6521.97 I think 15 or 20 years ago or something?
6524.67 So it dates us a little bit,
6525.54 but it was this movie where
he would be able to go
6529.65 and see these kind of pre crimes.
6531.39 And he had this big screen
where he could look at scenes
6536.478 from time and like kind of go
through that scene and see it.
6540.18 And so what individuals
taking ibogaine will say is
6543.78 that open eyes, they don't see anything,
6546.21 but closed eyes, they'll go back through
6548.76 and re-experience earlier life memories
6553.11 and they will be able to experience it
6555.69 from a place of empathy,
not only for themselves,
6561.36 but from others, and
kind of detached empathy
6564.81 and being able to see this
as almost a third party,
6568.26 even though they were there.
6570.24 But they're able to see it,
you know, as a third party.
6572.64 So Claudia Naranjo, a
psychiatrist from Argentina,
6576.09 described this for a lot
of books that he wrote,
6578.73 in I think the '80s and '90s around this.
6581.1 And so, you know, ibogaine's
been around for a long time.
6584.88 Howard Lotsof,
6586.38 American guy that brought
it over from Africa.
6589.35 He was a polysubstance user,
6590.79 used every drug that he
could get his hands on,
6594.57 took ibogaine,
6595.95 and including a lot of other
psychedelics, by the way,
6597.78 took ibogaine
6598.613 and then never did another
drug again, supposedly
6600.93 because he had such a
profound ibogaine experience.
6604.5 Ibogaine is in no way a
recreational substance.
6607.62 It's not a recreational substance
6609.15 if you want it to be a
recreational substance,
6611.13 because you're essentially having this,
6613.38 what they call life review.
6614.97 They also call it 10 years
of psychotherapy in a night.
6617.61 So these are the terminology
6619.53 that people talk about the issue.
6622.061 - How long does it last?
6622.894 Is it truly one night?
6624.3 - It's usually, you know, it can go,
6626.34 depending upon if you
get re-dosed or anything,
6627.96 go sometimes, depending upon
how fast you metabolize it,
6631.35 sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.
6633.69 Sometimes it can be shorter,
but it is a long time.
6637.497 It's a very long time.
6638.33 So it's definitely the longest
acting psychedelic substance
6642.06 I know of.
6643.29 And so people, you will take this,
6648.75 and they'll have this
reevaluation of a given memory.
6652.65 And then as we were talking about earlier,
6654.18 reconsolidate that memory again,
6656.28 and then it seems to
have, you know, an effect
6658.68 of that reconsolidation process.
6660.51 And so, you know, about
five, four, five years ago,
6664.71 I was tapped by Robert Malenka,
6666.81 one of the senior
neuroscientists we both know
6670.02 in the university.
6670.853 And he says, "Well,
there's an unnamed donor
6673.68 that's very interested
in funding a scientific,
6679.8 kind of open label study
of these Navy SEALs
6683.58 that have been going down to Mexico
6685.35 and taking ibogaine and also 5-MeO-DMT,"
6689.73 which I'll talk about in
a second, to treat PTSD.
6693.6 You know, they claim to
have traumatic brain injury,
6696.96 depression, you know, that
whole constellation of symptoms.
6700.38 You know, and as it was described to me
6702.9 by various people that had done this,
6705.3 by their spouses and
and whatnot, you know,
6708.9 John, we'll just say John,
6710.22 John couldn't screw a light bulb
6713.94 into a light fixture, right?
6715.862 They were just so debilitated
they couldn't do simple tasks,
6720.66 what we call activities of daily living.
6723.0 And they were coming back
6724.05 and having these really
dramatic improvements
6726.93 in all aspects of life.
6730.83 And so, you know,
6731.94 we have over the last
couple of years been able
6735.442 to do this first in human,
6739.44 kind of full neurobiological clinical
6742.2 neurocognitive evaluation
of what ibogaine is doing.
6746.82 In this case, in special operations,
6749.43 special forces individuals,
former Navy SEALs,
6752.4 former Army Rangers, that
kind of crew of folks,
6755.55 and look at the pre-post changes
6757.23 that their experience to be able
6759.57 to totally quantitate all of that.
6761.13 And so we've been able to
capture all the clinical scales,
6764.52 you know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
6766.59 all that standard stuff,
neurocognitive batteries.
6768.63 So how does your executive
function work specifically?
6771.21 How does your verbal memory, all of that?
6773.67 And then neuroimaging and EEG.
6775.86 So this will be the first human
study of ibogaine for those.
6779.91 And the reason why is because
ibogaine is kind of the...
6783.75 Both seemingly the most potent
6785.73 and most seemingly, to me at least,
6790.5 most powerful psychedelic,
6793.11 but the one that has the most risk too,
6795.57 because it has a cardiac effect.
6797.46 It seems to be that you
can screen people out
6799.53 that have risk off of
their electrocardiogram
6802.26 and reduce the risk quite a bit.
6804.03 And that's what we all did.
6805.44 But that's why people haven't
really studied it as much.
6809.31 And it isn't as, in addition,
6812.771 nobody goes to a rave on ibogaine.
6814.53 There's no recreation at all with this.
6816.033 - It's not fun.
6817.74 - It's, people say that it's relieving,
6820.53 but it's hard work, right?
6822.6 Because yeah, you're reexamining things.
6825.84 And you know, and so then
we see these folks after,
6830.94 and I'll tell you, you know,
6832.11 we haven't fully analyzed the data yet,
6834.06 but I'll tell you that, you know,
6836.79 from what my folks are telling
me, it's pretty dramatic.
6840.06 You know, people come back and
they're doing a lot better.
6843.78 They're doing a lot better.
6844.71 And nobody, I'll knock on wood,
6847.62 nobody's had any sort
of cardiac issue at all
6852.39 in the cohort that we've studied
6855.54 and they look a lot better and
they feel a lot better too.
6860.37 And they describe these experiences
6862.65 of being able to go back
through and, you know,
6866.43 soldiers experienced something
called moral injury, right?
6869.01 Where maybe they accidentally
blew something up
6872.28 and had a kid in it or
something like that.
6874.177 You know, if they're in Afghanistan, Iraq,
6877.02 maybe, you know, a child died on accident
6879.15 or maybe a civilian died
or whatever it was, right?
6883.317 And they suffer these moral
injuries as part of the job.
6886.08 And it's almost one of the
kind of vocational risks.
6889.44 They come back and say that
they've forgiven themselves,
6893.52 you know, which is huge, right?
6895.53 And part of that is being
able to see themselves
6898.53 in a different light and
having empathy finally
6900.93 for themselves and being able
6902.16 to kind of have that
experience of forgiving.
6905.28 And so, very cool.
6907.68 The study, you know,
what was happening was
6911.43 they were taking ibogaine
6912.36 and then taking something
called 5-MeO-DMT.
6914.52 People call it the Toad,
6915.48 it's the Sonoran River Toad.
6919.68 I think it's like you
can find these in Mexico,
6921.72 find 'em in Arizona.
6923.94 In the back of the toad produces
something called 5-MeO-DMT,
6929.88 which is a flavor of DMT
6933.03 that produces a particular
psychedelic effect
6935.97 also used as a sacrament.
6938.52 - Is it dimethyltryptamine?
6940.59 - It is a 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine.
6944.46 So it's a kind of a dimethyltryptamine
6946.14 with a kind of addition to it.
6947.79 The deal there is that it lasts
longer than traditional DMT.
6954.805 You know, it's like 20
minutes to five, three,
6956.73 or whatever kind of thing.
6958.56 And so these guys were taking ibogaine
6962.58 and then they would take
the 5-MeO-DMT after.
6965.85 We had to kind of divorce those two things
6967.986 to be able to do the study
6968.819 and just understand what
the ibogaine was doing.
6970.56 And they'd go back down a month later
6971.91 and they'll do the 5-MeO-DMT.
6974.42 - So two completely separate sessions.
6976.35 - [Nolan] Two completely
separate sessions.
6977.88 - And then one quick
question about ibogaine
6979.38 before a bit more on 5-MeO-DMT.
6982.62 Is the ibogaine journey guided,
6985.11 or the person just closes their eyes
6986.73 and they just start falling
6987.96 into the back catalog of memories?
6990.06 - They have a bunch of
preparatory sessions,
6992.49 and then they have a
bunch of sessions after
6994.29 that they're able to
kind of rehash things.
6997.56 During, there's a sitter that sits there
6999.45 and kind of sits with
them and helps them out,
7003.35 but it's not, it's pretty, the
phenomenon of the drug seems
7008.0 to drive a lot of this, right?
7009.89 And so a lot of it ends up being
7011.36 what we call supportive psychotherapy.
7012.8 You're just kind of being there
7014.33 and, you know, maybe you're
holding the person's hand,
7016.25 maybe you're just saying "I'm here,"
7018.23 or maybe whatever it is,
7019.37 but you're making sure
they know you're around.
7021.53 But there's not really
an interaction per se.
7025.19 And then the whole kind
of goal there is just
7028.1 to get folks to kind go back through
7029.75 and reexamine these memories
7031.88 and ultimately look like
they reconsolidate them.
7035.18 And you know, it's very interesting.
7038.0 I mean, there's this kind
of, as you said earlier,
7042.2 Timothy Leary kind of
sociocultural construct
7045.53 that ends up being
overlaid over psychedelics.
7048.53 And what I think is
that if you rid yourself
7053.66 of all of those preconceived notions
7056.0 of what it is and isn't,
7057.62 and the counterculture movement,
7058.91 all that stuff that neither
of us were ever involved in,
7060.843 neither of us are ever
partake in, you know,
7063.91 as kind of straight scientists
looking at this, right?
7066.26 If you can kind of rid yourself
7067.4 of all those sociocultural constructions
7069.98 and then reexamine this,
7072.29 if we just discovered these today,
7074.75 we would say that these sorts of drugs are
7078.2 a huge breakthrough in psychiatry
7079.97 because they allow for us to do a lot
7082.37 of the sorts of things we've
been thinking about with SSRIs,
7085.85 with psychotherapy, but
kind of combined, right?
7089.12 Psychotherapy plus drugs
7092.21 in a substance that kind of allows you
7094.61 to reexamine these things.
7096.41 And so it's interesting.
7098.255 There's a lot to do to try
to figure out if that's true,
7102.08 you know?
7102.913 And I can say that as it stands right now,
7105.2 we don't know if that
statement is true, right?
7108.5 There's a lot more work
that needs to happen
7110.45 for that statement to
be proven to be true.
7112.1 But the hypothesis is, if it is true,
7115.88 then it's very likely
that this will be seen
7119.51 as a breakthrough because it allows you
7121.97 to do these sorts of
things that you can't do
7124.34 with normal waking consciousness.
7126.77 But also why we have to
really think about this.
7130.04 And, you know, these drugs
can't be recreational drugs.
7135.29 They really shouldn't be
recreational drugs, right?
7138.59 They're really too powerful to be used
7141.77 in the context of recreation
7143.42 because they can put
you into these states.
7146.36 And this generation of
psychedelic researchers are
7150.11 really clear about that.
7152.245 You know, I think the '60s
folks were not clear about that,
7154.58 and they felt like there
was this whole kind
7156.98 of cultural thing that was going on there.
7159.32 But I think this cohort of
individuals really understands
7163.25 that in order to really make this happen,
7165.65 we have to understand
7166.79 that if you need a
prescription for an SSRI,
7170.42 which doesn't change your
consciousness a whole lot,
7173.9 and we're very worried about that,
7175.73 and the doctor has to evaluate
you for that every week,
7178.61 that the idea that some of these
substances would go outside
7182.09 of very strict medical supervision is
7185.57 kind of preposterous actually.
7187.04 It's kind of a dumb moment, I think,
7189.77 for all of medicine to say,
7191.57 look, if we're going to do this right,
7193.85 we've got to do it such a
way that's so protected,
7196.85 that's so safe, that we
make sure people know
7200.21 these things are not recreational
7202.07 and they're really for the pure purposes
7204.17 of really powerfully changing
cognition for a while
7208.52 and letting people have these
what seem to be, you know,
7211.73 relatively therapeutic states.
7214.363 - I think it's great that
you're doing this study.
7215.72 And along the lines of the
sort of the early iterations
7219.26 of psychedelics and the
counterculture of the '60s and '70s,
7222.38 some of which took place,
7223.58 like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"
7224.9 I think is actually based
on the Menlo Park VA,
7228.92 which is in our neighborhood of Stanford.
7232.94 And things are quite a bit different now.
7234.74 I know you and I have spent
some time with the operators
7238.22 and former operators at an event,
7240.11 and last Veterans Day, in fact,
7242.09 the so-called Veteran Solutions group
7243.86 that's pioneering a lot of
these psychedelic treatments
7247.01 for former special operators
and current special operators.
7249.38 And what's interesting to me about that is
7252.17 in contrast to the counterculture movement
7255.17 of the '60s and '70s, that
room was filled with people
7258.65 that are very much of a
structure, the military.
7261.44 Right?
7262.638 So it's no longer considered
left wing, right wing,
7265.49 anti-military, pro-military.
7266.96 Here this isn't just
about one group of people
7269.09 who's exploring
psychedelics as a treatment
7270.95 for trauma and PTSD and other things.
7273.977 And of course you also have other domains
7275.9 of society looking at this.
7276.95 And in fact, there were, but
it was really interesting
7278.9 because there were both far
left and far right politicians
7283.82 at that event up on stage together,
7286.7 talking about, in kind of
lighter terms, heart medicine,
7290.3 but also talking about
neurobiology and talking.
7292.46 It was just fascinating
from the perspective
7295.4 of somebody who's trying
to learn about this stuff,
7296.93 that psychedelic therapies no longer sit
7300.32 within the anti-establishment realm.
7303.683 It's independent of all that,
7307.67 certainly when people in
the military are adopting it
7309.65 as a potential treatment.
7311.15 Again, still under exploration,
7312.68 but also under exploration
at universities like Stanford
7315.62 and Johns Hopkins and UCSF
and University College London
7319.01 and on and on.
7320.63 Along the lines of tree
barks and toad skins,
7324.11 tell me about ayahuasca.
7326.48 And as a plant, you know, it's intriguing.
7329.63 And is it pro-serotonergic
drug like psilocybin?
7335.75 And is it useful for the
same sorts of conditions
7339.8 that we've talked about thus far?
7341.9 And if you could perhaps
tell me a little bit also
7344.57 about the Brazilian prisoner study.
7347.0 - Yeah, yeah.
7347.9 Definitely.
7348.74 Ayahuasca is another psychedelic.
7350.54 It's used as a sacrament
in Brazil and in Peru
7356.36 and Ecuador, in Columbia.
7358.16 So a lot of the South American countries.
7361.432 And what they do is they
combine two plants together,
7367.19 where one plant of the
two plant combination
7370.97 would effectively do nothing,
7373.22 but the two plant combination
together is capable
7376.67 of producing this very
profound psychedelic effect.
7381.62 And what's really kind of
curious is that there are,
7387.2 as I understand it,
7388.434 10 to 20,000 plant species in the Amazon.
7393.11 And somehow, somebody-
7395.754 - Someone tried 'em all.
7396.98 - Combined these two plants together
7399.44 in certain proportionality
7401.69 and cooked this for five, 10 hours
7404.63 to the point where you cook
out the dimethyltryptamine
7407.87 out of one of the plants
7408.95 and cook out the reversible
monoamine oxidase inhibitor
7412.88 out of the other plant in such a way
7415.49 that the reversible monoamine
oxidase inhibitor prevents
7420.14 the GI breakdown of the dimethyltryptamine
7423.41 in such a way that it's then allowed
7425.27 to cross the blood-brain
barrier and get into the brain.
7429.32 And if you didn't add
7430.76 the reversible monoamine
oxidase inhibitor plant derived
7434.57 into this combination,
7436.49 then it would never cross the brain.
7438.47 If you put people on a standard,
7441.71 psychiatry prescribed
monoamine oxidase inhibitor
7444.5 that wasn't reversible,
7447.08 you'd throw them into
serotonin syndrome, right?
7449.99 So this kind of like sweet spot
7453.35 that somehow ayahuasca
practitioners have found
7456.82 of being able to get DMT into
the brain from an oral source
7461.42 with this combination of a
monoamine oxidase inhibitor
7464.84 is curious.
7467.06 And so that substance has been explored
7469.79 as an antidepressant agent,
7471.53 and some studies have looked at that.
7473.84 It also seems to be very safe.
7475.91 There's a psychiatrist down at UCLA Harbor
7480.14 who's done a lot of work with this,
7481.82 where he's looked at children even
7484.61 that have been exposed to kind
of small doses of ayahuasca
7488.27 as kind of a sacrament
within Amazonian tribes
7492.11 and found no neurocognitive effects,
7493.73 no neurocognitive effects in adults.
7496.13 And so it appears to be safe.
7500.12 It's kind of part and brought
into various religions,
7505.01 including kind of merged with
Catholicism in South America,
7508.46 which is kind of very interesting.
7510.23 And so, you know, in some
sects of Catholicism in Brazil,
7517.28 it's used as a sacrament
during religious ceremonies.
7521.75 And so it became interesting
to Brazilian researchers
7525.32 as to whether or not they
could affect recidivism rates
7528.44 for prisoners in Brazilian prisons, right?
7531.67 So they gave half of
the prisoners, you know,
7535.88 some sort of inert substance
7537.68 and half of the prisoners
an ayahuasca session.
7541.94 And the recidivism rate or
the return to prison rate
7545.81 in the ayahuasca exposed individuals was
7548.06 statistically significantly
lower than the recidivism rate
7551.934 in the control group,
suggesting that, you know,
7556.07 whatever is going on there
seems to have an effect
7559.25 on whatever drives criminal behavior,
7562.4 whatever criminal behavior
that happened to be.
7564.35 And I don't have the details
7566.06 on the exact nature of the crime.
7568.7 You know, I am also in no way saying
7570.65 that we should just be giving psychedelics
7572.36 to folks in prison and all of that.
7575.0 I think that that is a
very edgy thing to do
7578.75 and probably not something
that anybody should try,
7581.33 but it does kind of bring
up this curious question
7585.44 of what is it about that
that would drive people
7588.5 to change those behaviors
7591.47 and why do people make
those behavioral decisions?
7595.007 And a lot of times
7596.78 if you look at prisons
in the United States,
7599.69 you know, people say this,
7601.04 what's the biggest mental health facility
7602.72 in the United States?
7604.01 It's a prison.
7605.84 - Yeah, there's a lot to
unpack there for sure.
7609.694 You know, the homeless
issue, the prison issue.
7615.38 It does lead to something
that I heard recently,
7618.2 which is related to all
this, which is cannabis.
7622.081 You know, we hear a lot
nowadays about people will say,
7624.89 well, it's safer than alcohol.
7626.12 And we did an episode on alcohol that,
7628.07 at least by my read of the literature,
7630.41 indeed alcohol does seem to be quite bad
7633.41 for our health beyond...
7634.82 I think it's pretty clear
that not drinking is better
7637.55 for your health than drinking at all.
7639.71 And here, I'm not trying
to tell people what to do,
7641.447 but those are what the data say.
7642.71 And forget the studies on red wine.
7644.48 You'd have to drink so much red wine
7645.71 to get enough resveratrol.
7646.91 It's not even clear resveratrol
does anything useful anyway,
7649.85 et cetera, et cetera.
7651.11 Nonetheless, cannabis is now available
7653.42 in a lot of very high potency forms.
7655.79 People are vaping cannabis,
people are smoking cannabis.
7660.32 I certainly am not saying
that cannabis is bad
7662.57 for people necessarily,
although I think children,
7665.6 I would hope
7666.8 that their brain development
would be completed first,
7668.99 you know, get to age 25.
7670.25 I know that sounds late
for a lot of people,
7672.89 but the THC obviously taps
into some endogenous systems
7679.423 and the cannabinoid
systems and is powerful.
7683.48 And I've seen this report
that was in Lancet Psychiatry
7689.36 this last year that said that
early use of potent cannabis,
7692.81 meaning age 14 to 20 or so,
7696.17 can potentially lead to an exacerbation
7698.69 of psychosis later in life.
7700.64 And I actually put this
out on social media
7702.86 and it sort of exploded.
7704.691 I didn't expect it to.
7706.517 And people were saying,
well, that's not causal.
7708.29 And obviously it's not causal
because people say, well,
7711.41 maybe people with psychotic tendencies
7713.96 are seeking out cannabis.
7715.19 Although that's sort of a weak argument
7716.63 in the sense that there's
at least a 4X increase
7722.27 in these psychotic episodes
for people later in life.
7725.6 But what are your thoughts about cannabis?
7726.8 Because I do want to acknowledge
7727.85 that it does have medical
benefits for certain things,
7730.49 pain, chemotherapy.
7732.65 So by no means trying to knock on cannabis
7735.14 and its appropriate medicinal use.
7737.45 But what should we think about cannabis
7741.14 in terms of this finding
7742.73 that it can exacerbate a
psychosis in certain individuals?
7746.51 - Yeah, so I think, you know,
7748.551 there's a couple of things, right?
7750.89 So cannabis is multiple
cannibinoids, right?
7754.661 - Right, THC, CBD, CBN,
sativas, and, you know, indicas,
7758.6 it gets, yeah, there's
a lot there to unpack.
7761.24 - Yeah, there's a lot.
7762.737 But there are two main kind
of chemicals you think about
7767.091 and kind of how things are
essentially bred, right?
7770.72 And so, you know,
there's a lot of cannabis
7773.75 that's really bred to be
very high, very potent THC.
7778.506 And there's cannabis where
the THC's bred completely out.
7781.7 So there's stories, you
know, from Colorado, right?
7785.99 This strain of cannabis that's THC free,
7789.98 there's no THC at all, and it's all CBD,
7793.46 and it's called Charlotte's Web.
7796.58 And a bunch of kids' parents, one kid,
7799.94 and then kind of a string
of parents after that moved
7802.07 to Colorado when cannabis was legalized,
7805.46 because CBD is antiepileptic,
7809.51 so CBD is also antipsychotic.
7813.59 And so there have been a number of studies
7815.033 that if you give CBD at high doses,
7818.39 it's antipsychotic in established
schizophrenic patients.
7824.57 The issue is
7825.403 that we've bred CBD out of
marijuana selectively over time.
7829.49 We've gotten very good
7830.323 at figuring out how to do that, right?
7832.34 Conversely, THC is pro psychotic
and pro epileptic, right?
7840.29 And so when you talk about
does cannabis cause psychosis
7843.65 or does cannabis treat psychosis,
7846.35 it appears to be more related
7848.24 to the proportions of CBD to THC
7852.35 than it does to the kind
of idea of cannabis.
7855.02 So for me,
7857.195 and I have no stock in
this or anything like that,
7859.88 but there's a company
called GW Pharmaceuticals,
7861.92 and I haven't looked into them in a while,
7863.42 but they have a lot of clinical trials
7867.41 for something called Dravet Syndrome,
7869.3 which is a seizure disorder
where kids seize a whole lot,
7872.06 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,
which is a seizure disorder,
7875.27 kids are seizing 300 times a day.
7876.89 Both of these are like
kids are seizing so much,
7879.68 they're basically in a seizure
7880.88 or in the postictal phase constantly.
7883.97 And they've failed everything.
7885.74 They've failed barbiturates,
they've failed bromides,
7888.71 which we just don't use
anymore except in these cases
7892.76 because of the side effects.
7894.14 And they'll give kids CBD.
7895.845 And I think CBD is a pretty safe drug
7897.5 compared to bromide, right?
7899.15 And so this idea that CBD
in a kid is actually safe,
7905.27 it's a cannabinoid, but it's
CBD and it's safe, right?
7908.687 And so that to me is totally fine.
7912.44 Also giving CBD as an adjunctive treatment
7915.89 for schizophrenia.
7917.21 There have been some positive trials
7919.01 and negative trials in that,
7919.91 but there seems to be no
negative side effects.
7921.83 It seems to reduce some of
the metabolic syndrome issues
7924.92 in folks with schizophrenia
who are having side effects
7928.13 from the primary antipsychotic.
7930.8 The converse is, there's
clearly cases where people
7934.04 that are taking very high
doses of THC become psychotic,
7938.93 they get put into the
psychiatric unit, nothing happens
7941.96 other than they kind of get
the THC out of their system,
7945.77 and then they resolve
their psychosis, right?
7948.8 And so that, and you know,
7952.957 a handful of people who have had seizures
7954.41 related to high doses of THC and syncope
7957.11 and all sorts of things.
7958.43 And so this idea that THC,
7961.82 high doses of THC can be pro psychotic,
7965.09 is also not taking a shot at people
7966.95 that think that cannabis
overall is a good thing.
7969.89 It's just, it just is what it is.
7972.05 And the kind of pure, I
think if you zoom back
7974.54 and you say you're a true naturalist,
7976.91 you're thinking about natural
medicines in the world,
7979.43 you should think, well,
7980.96 probably marijuana was
balanced THC CBD at some point,
7984.23 and then we humans messed with it, right?
7986.87 And that most likely, that was
probably okay at some level,
7993.11 and then we pushed it one way or another.
7996.14 And what I mean by okay
is in a 45 year old,
7999.41 it's okay, kind of thing.
8002.23 Now, what I think is
going on with the kids,
8006.37 with the teenagers,
8007.42 is you've got prefrontal
maturation, right?
8009.52 And then you're exposing them
8011.11 to a whole lot of high THC load.
8015.34 And while it's unclear
if it's cause or effect,
8020.56 it's certainly in the picture.
8022.12 And if I were a parent,
8023.65 I wouldn't want my 16 year
old smoking marijuana.
8026.8 If I were a parent and my 30
year old, otherwise healthy,
8032.29 totally fine, you know, whatever,
banker, lawyer kid decided
8038.02 to try marijuana for the first time,
8039.88 I wouldn't scold them about it, right?
8041.86 So I think it's this kind
of a different thing, right?
8043.87 I would never want my up to 25 year old,
8047.35 just like you're saying,
before prefrontal maturation,
8049.78 I would never want my
kid to be exposed at all.
8053.32 But it looks like, except
in susceptible individuals
8057.97 that are susceptible to
drug-induced psychosis,
8059.92 it looks like, you know,
it's a relatively safe thing
8065.02 past prefrontal maturation.
8067.9 You know, again, I'm not going
to comment of cause and effect,
8071.26 but I would say that, you
know, if you're a parent,
8076.0 it doesn't make much sense, right?
8077.686 You never know what's ultimately
going to hurt your kid.
8080.71 I mean, we were talking
about this earlier,
8082.57 my wife's pregnant now.
8083.956 She kind of avoids everything, right?
8086.2 Rightfully so, right?
8087.43 This idea that we just,
we want to be careful
8090.07 when our children's brains are developing.
8091.78 And I think that's really
what you were saying
8093.52 and I think actually important.
8095.56 The bigger question that you asked,
8097.63 which is relative risks of
drugs, is an interesting one.
8101.23 So David Nutt published in, I
think it was in "The Lancet,"
8104.08 I'll have to look it up,
but I think in "The Lancet,"
8106.27 an article about relative drug risks
8109.51 for the person and for society.
8111.19 And this was like,
8112.63 he was on the UK's like
British Drug Policy Group,
8120.52 where essentially what he showed was
8122.56 if you look at societal
risk plus personal risk,
8126.91 and you combine those two,
8128.56 you know what drug is the most
dangerous drug in the world?
8132.46 - I'm going to guess it's alcohol.
8133.6 - It's alcohol,
8134.92 right behind heroin and
cocaine and da da da da da,
8138.247 and somewhere in the middle is marijuana.
8139.27 And right on the tail end,
8140.705 on the exact other end
of this, psilocybin.
8147.1 - Is caffeine, usually
doesn't make the list.
8150.09 - It may have been on the list.
8151.69 If it was, it was probably
pretty close to psilocybin,
8154.0 but somewhere in the middle was ketamine,
8156.04 somewhere in the middle was amphetamine,
8158.86 somewhere in the, you know,
8159.94 a little closer to psilocybin,
I think was MDMA, you know.
8163.723 But it's this combined
personal kind of world risk
8169.27 of these things.
8170.103 And so alcohol makes it,
8172.6 because there's a huge
amount of personal risk
8175.18 and there's a huge amount
of societal risk, right?
8177.64 Drunk drivers kill X amount
of people in the world.
8180.85 - Fight, sexual assault, all that.
8183.372 - All that, yeah.
8184.387 And then all the cancer
and all that stuff.
8187.09 And so it beats out cocaine,
it beats out heroin,
8189.79 it beats out all of these things.
8191.917 And yet, we don't, as a
culture, for whatever reason,
8197.44 we don't as a culture see it as a drug.
8201.43 And that's the part that
really baffles me, you know?
8204.64 - I mean, they serve it.
8205.57 I mean, this is no knock
on Stanford at all.
8208.27 Of course, I wouldn't do that.
8209.576 This is at every institution I've been to,
8210.97 they serve alcohol at the
graduate student events.
8214.556 - [Nolan] That's right.
8215.526 - You know, they serve alcohol.
8217.33 They do a happy hour.
8218.62 I've never been a drinker.
8219.85 I can take it or leave it.
8221.296 - [Nolan] Yeah, same.
8222.129 - And I realize that some people,
they really enjoy alcohol.
8224.89 You know, my former partner, I mean,
8226.9 she just was in that 10% or so of people
8230.05 who have a glass of wine
and just feel great.
8232.51 And the second one, feel great.
8234.1 I just want to take a nap
after I have a bit of alcohol,
8237.04 so it never does much for me.
8238.09 I always feel poisoned.
8239.5 I feel lucky in that sense.
8240.76 But it's unbelievable
that it is so prevalent
8245.62 and it's just, it's
baked into the medical,
8248.02 even medical institutions,
8249.49 they'll pop a bottle of champagne
8250.84 to celebrate the opening of a hospital.
8252.956 - [Nolan] That's right, that's right.
8254.065 - You know, that's pretty crazy.
8255.37 - Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
8256.63 You know, I think what's going to happen,
8259.03 but this is me, you know,
8260.8 looking at the crystal ball a little bit,
8262.24 but I think what's going to happen is
8264.01 what happened with doctors and smoking.
8265.45 So if you look at the
'50s and '60s, right?
8267.327 There are all these pictures
of doctors smoking cigarettes,
8270.1 you know, with patients or, you know,
8272.05 psychiatrists doing psychotherapy
and smoking a cigarette
8274.39 with the patient sitting on the couch,
8275.8 you know, surgeons smoking a
cigarette in between cases,
8278.89 there are all these
pictures of that, right?
8280.54 And now all of a sudden,
smoking's totally banned.
8282.73 I think it's totally banned
from most of Stanford campus.
8285.97 My suspicion is, as
you're suggesting, right?
8289.15 You know, this is everywhere
8290.53 and it's all kind of ubiquitous.
8291.97 At some critical point,
some tipping point,
8295.48 everybody's going to realize
that, just like with smoking,
8299.29 we've got to rid hospital systems
8301.9 and universities of alcohol.
8304.69 And at some point in 50 years,
8307.87 it's my view that we'll look
it back at these scenarios
8311.44 that you're talking about
and be like, you know what,
8314.86 we were foolish about this.
8318.175 I can't believe that
we gave people alcohol
8320.956 when they graduated
from whatever, you know?
8323.56 And I think we'll have
a different take on it,
8325.81 but it's going to take a longer time.
8327.995 I think people did a really
good job tying smoking
8331.35 to lung cancer and it's like
a very simplistic story.
8334.96 Smoking, lung cancer, you know?
8337.9 Now, as you know,
8339.82 alcohol increases the risk of
a lot of different cancers.
8342.76 Not so clear which one.
8344.5 I mean, there's like, you
know, the kind of oral,
8346.24 like the throat, tongue
cancer, that's one of-
8348.13 - Breast cancer.
8348.963 - Yeah, breast cancer, you know?
8350.08 And so it's kind of just,
it's a harder story to tell,
8354.28 you know?
8355.113 And I think that's why, and everybody,
8357.4 you know, and then there's this whole,
8358.51 it's, you know, my mom says this.
8359.957 It's like I drank my glass of wine
8362.11 because my doctor told
me it was heart healthy.
8365.02 And we were talking
about this, and I try to,
8367.0 no, no, no, but Dr. So-and-so
said it's heart healthy.
8370.42 And so it ends up being this thing
8371.89 where like she's drinking
alcohol because she thinks
8374.8 that it's good for her heart.
8377.685 And, you know, and it's hard.
8379.51 I've had those conversations with her.
8380.98 It's hard to untie that.
8382.87 And I think that, yeah,
8384.52 at some point we're going to
hit some threshold moment.
8388.36 And it'll be interesting if
we really look at the data
8390.52 and we really look at
what's safe and not safe
8392.92 purely from this analysis,
8395.02 it kind of points to the right direction.
8398.38 - It's really interesting.
8399.213 And also say nothing of poor judgment
8401.44 under the influence of alcohol.
8402.94 I mean, I would venture
8404.74 that if we were to remove
alcohol from university campuses,
8408.52 watch, the students are
going to lobby against me
8410.17 if I say this.
8411.003 But if you were to remove
alcohol from campuses,
8414.16 I mean, just think about
what I suspect would be
8417.22 the improvement in good decision making.
8420.497 And that would occur.
8423.46 Or, you know, I've got stories
from graduate school and...
8427.54 It was very different,
you know, 10 years ago.
8430.36 There was a lot more alcohol consumption.
8432.43 Again, that was never my thing,
8433.45 but I know people who
make really bad decisions.
8437.5 In any case, there's a whole
landscape there emerging.
8440.08 I think you got your finger
right on the pulse of it.
8442.6 I want to touch on
something slightly different
8444.97 than what we've been talking about,
8445.93 but definitely related to depression.
8447.67 And this, again,
8448.503 is one of these intriguing
but perplexing things,
8451.0 which is that sleep deprivation
can improve symptoms
8455.8 of depression.
8457.0 And yet I'm personally
very familiar with the fact
8460.12 that if I don't sleep well for one night
8462.43 or don't sleep at all, in fact,
8464.23 I do have an ability to function
pretty well the next day.
8466.69 I'll do this non-sleep deep rest practice
8468.52 that I blab a lot about on
the Huberman Lab Podcast,
8470.75 which for me is tremendously restorative,
8472.75 but I like a good night's sleep.
8475.06 I think everybody understands now,
8478.18 thanks to the great work of Matthew Walker
8480.07 and others that have really
gotten out into the world
8482.02 saying, look, the
foundation of mental health,
8484.9 physical health, and high
performance, if that's your thing,
8487.9 being a functional human being,
8489.01 is to try and get enough
quality deep sleep
8492.67 at least 80% of the nights
of your life, if you can.
8495.614 That's something to focus on.
8497.32 Just like good nutrition,
8498.67 just like exercise and
social connection, et cetera.
8502.15 So sleep deprivation,
we know, in particular,
8505.3 I think rapid eye movement
components of sleep deprivation
8508.39 can improve the symptoms of depression.
8511.06 And yet being sleep deprived
can also really disregulate
8515.95 our control of the autonomic system.
8517.57 I notice on night two or
night three of poor sleep,
8519.73 if I'm going through a stressful
phase and that's happening,
8522.61 all of a sudden my heart
rate is chronically elevated,
8525.43 my thought patterns
become really disrupted.
8527.5 I can't then exercise, my
decision making is thrown off,
8531.28 my emotionality is more labile.
8532.72 The hinge, as we were
referring to it earlier,
8535.03 feels less in control, under my control.
8538.21 And maybe I wonder sometimes
if I enter that state
8541.39 that you refer to earlier,
8542.29 where the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex is
8544.51 no longer leading the cingulate,
8546.01 but the cingulate is now in charge.
8547.72 The players are in charge of the coach.
8550.24 Not a good situation.
8551.74 So I know you've done some
work on sleep deprivation
8554.5 and light and effects.
8557.05 Please tell us about that
8558.16 and please tell us about
this triple therapy.
8560.95 Is that?
- Yeah, yeah.
8561.783 So friend of mine, Greg Salem,
8564.22 another one of the professors at Stanford,
8567.88 was very interested in sleep.
8569.17 He did a bunch of training in sleep
8572.02 before he went to medical school
8573.28 and got very interested in this
idea that, as you're saying,
8577.81 if you sleep deprive somebody one night
8581.74 in just kind of an isolated single night,
8584.44 at the end of that sleep deprivation,
8586.24 they will have an antidepressant effect,
8588.01 but as soon as they fall
asleep, they lose it.
8590.47 So if it's a depressed individual,
8593.05 you can get them to be
less depressed acutely.
8596.2 Soon as they fall asleep, they
wake up eight hours later,
8599.05 then they come back into the
same level of depression.
8602.44 And so the idea is that you needed
8604.48 to do some sort of circadian reset.
8606.58 And that part of what depression is,
8609.46 is that it's a dysregulated
circadian system.
8612.16 And so mentors of mine say,
8613.96 if you can just get the sleep better,
8615.82 that's half the battle of
dealing with depression.
8617.337 'Cause so many people have
insomnia around depression
8621.1 and have a whole host
of types of insomnia.
8624.28 Having a hard time falling asleep,
8625.6 waking up in the middle of the
night, and waking up earlier,
8627.7 all symptoms of depression.
8630.19 And so what this does is it
sleep deprives the individual
8635.17 and then there's a certain calculation
8637.09 of shifting their phase
8639.46 and simultaneously exposing
them to bright lights.
8642.7 So that's the triple, the phase shift,
8645.1 the sleep deprivation,
and the bright light,
8647.26 to try to get their circadian rhythm.
8650.65 Essentially the theory is reintrained.
8654.1 And so, you know, in the
trials that we've done
8658.03 and other trials prior to
ours and after, you know,
8662.572 it looked like there was
8663.405 a pretty profound antidepressant effect
8666.34 from this triple therapy
that seemed to be durable,
8670.45 meaning durability is this term we use
8673.45 to say that not only can you
get kind of point relief,
8676.3 but that the relief ends
up, you know, lasting.
8679.45 What's important to
know about this is like,
8681.67 you shouldn't do this at home for sure.
8684.31 You would need to do
this with a professional,
8685.87 'cause it's complicated,
it's not just one thing.
8688.57 And sleep deprivation,
8691.24 while it seems to be
antidepressant, it's pro anxiety.
8694.9 So if you take a highly anxious
person that's not depressed
8696.97 and you sleep deprive them,
they get profoundly anxious.
8699.91 And so that's the other thing
8701.41 that you have to really realize is
8702.493 that this is like everything else
8704.89 that I've talked about today,
8706.06 all things that you have to
do under medical supervision,
8709.57 but curious, right?
8711.337 And I think, you know, the
question that always comes up is
8714.4 why isn't this used more?
8716.23 And I think the reason is
8717.76 that there's not really a
mechanism for, you know,
8721.48 ultimately in medicine, as sad as it is,
8723.94 you have to have a code to do a thing.
8726.07 There has to be a code
associated with a treatment
8729.07 and it's hard to figure out
how to make a code for this.
8732.04 And so I think that's part of it.
8733.69 And so if there's a way,
8736.57 and somebody's got to kind
of take that baton on that,
8739.6 but if there's a way to
make a code for this,
8742.84 you know, I think you could
actually turn it into something
8745.96 that was more widely utilized.
8748.42 And, you know, probably dream up ways
8751.36 of how to integrate AI, passive sensing,
8755.26 all that stuff to really make that work.
8757.66 But I think that would be the idea,
8760.3 that would be the trajectory
I'd see, so, yeah.
8762.49 - Yeah, having a billable to
insurance code is fundamental.
8767.08 And a lot of listeners to this podcast,
8769.33 I think, have a background
in engineering science.
8771.61 And we will put a link to that manuscript
8774.01 that talks about the triple therapy,
8775.21 because here we're talking
8776.29 about one night sleep deprivation,
8777.67 some timed light exposure to the eyes,
8780.34 and then shifting in the
circadian clock being central
8783.01 to the themes of the
podcast that come up often.
8786.49 I think for the typical person,
8788.38 can we say that trying to get
a regular light dark cycle
8792.76 at sleep rhythm would be beneficial
8794.2 for overall mood regulation?
8796.03 - Yeah, I think for the
typical person, you know,
8800.263 really kind of reregulating your sleep
8802.72 and trying to get, you
know, a good night's sleep
8805.06 in which you fall asleep, stay asleep,
8807.52 wake up at a set time every
morning is going to be
8811.21 pretty crucial.
8813.37 You know, in mild depression,
8815.14 I think that one has a
lot of control over that.
8817.5 As we were talking about earlier,
8818.59 I think when you hit some
threshold in depression
8820.69 where things become
kind of semi-volitional
8822.52 and it's harder to kind of
will yourself into that.
8826.12 There are therapies like, you know,
8829.06 there's a CBT for insomnia, for instance,
8831.16 where you can do cognitive
behavioral therapy
8832.84 to help with insomnia.
8834.46 Sometimes people, and I'm no sleep expert.
8837.58 Kind of pass this to Greg
to fully talk about this,
8840.074 but some of what goes on
8843.4 that people with kind of
milder insomnia experience is
8847.09 like blue light out of their
computer and things like that,
8850.467 so you can use like
blue light blockers to,
8853.69 it tricks your brain, as
you know better than me,
8856.24 it tricks your brain to think
that it's still light outside.
8858.91 And so people will still have insomnia
8861.55 because their brain still
thinks that it's light outside.
8864.52 And then people will, you know,
8867.217 the kind of strict CBT for sleep.
8871.42 You know, therapists will
say there are only two things
8874.84 that you should do in your bed.
8876.52 And if you're under a
certain age and whatnot,
8879.67 it's really one thing that
you should do in your bed,
8881.8 which is to sleep and be
with your partner, right?
8885.517 And so those are kind of the two things
8889.99 that you should do in a bedroom.
8891.1 And that's really the only things
8892.45 that you should do in a bedroom
8893.38 if you're having sleep problems.
8894.94 You shouldn't watch TV in a bedroom,
8895.927 you shouldn't eat in a
bedroom, shouldn't hang out.
8897.823 - Keep the phone out of the bedroom.
8899.29 - [Nolan] Keep the phone
out of the bedroom, yeah.
8901.09 - Yeah.
8902.5 We should get Greg Salem on the podcast.
8904.352 I'll just mention
8905.29 for people that want to
regulate their sleep,
8906.61 we have a sleep toolkit that's available
8909.67 as a downloadable PDF at hubermanlab.com.
8911.89 Just go to the menu
and a lot of the things
8913.42 in that toolkit are based on work
8915.55 from Stanford Sleep Laboratories,
8917.11 including Jamie Zeitz and others' lab,
8919.75 not aimed at depression specifically.
8924.28 Listen, Nolan, Dr. Williams,
8928.18 this has been an amazing voyage
8930.85 through the circuitry
of autonomic control.
8933.67 This landscape of the
prefrontal cortex is,
8935.849 I find incredibly fascinating
and I just want to start off
8940.69 by saying please do come back again
8942.383 and teach us more about
that and your TMS work.
8946.9 Before we wrap, however,
8948.79 I do want to give you the opportunity
8950.47 to talk about the SAINT study.
8952.25 - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely.
8953.083 - Is it SAINT or SAINTS plural?
8954.34 - Yeah, it's SAINT.
8955.816 So SAINT, or we're calling it SNT now.
8959.8 SAINT has, you know...
8961.45 The intent was not to kind
of connect it to religion,
8964.965 but we may have accidentally done so.
8968.35 And so we abbreviated it to SNT
8971.077 for the subsequent trials,
which was initially
8974.5 Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy,
8977.8 or now what we're calling
Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy.
8980.02 But the idea there, which is a cool idea,
8983.71 is that TMS is a device
that delivers a treatment,
8992.14 and the treatment is the protocol.
8994.387 And the protocol is the
stimulation parameter set
8999.22 in a specific brain region
for a specific condition.
9003.24 And so what's cool about neuromodulation,
9005.55 whether it be transcranial
magnetic stimulation
9008.22 or transcranial direct current stimulation
9009.99 or deep brain stimulation,
9011.13 like what Casey Halpern talked
about on another podcast,
9015.21 is this idea that in all of those cases,
9019.14 the device itself is a
physical layer conduit
9023.22 of a stimulation protocol
that's therapeutic
9026.88 for a given condition
in a given brain region.
9029.4 And so in the case of depression,
9031.05 which we know the most about for with TMS,
9033.45 we've been doing TMS
studies for depression for,
9036.72 you know, since 1995, right?
9039.18 And the clearance in 2000, 2008, 2009.
9043.35 And in that timeframe,
9046.44 we were able to go from really
knowing very little at all
9050.37 about how to do something like this
9051.9 to getting an FDA clearance.
9053.817 And the way that it went down was
9055.59 that there were two groups
studying different components
9060.84 at NIH.
9061.673 The first group was
studying mood neuroanatomy
9065.52 on functional imaging.
9066.81 That was kind of the first generation
9068.19 of functional imaging
back then, so PET scans,
9071.46 which are kind of metabolic
scans, and then SPECT scans.
9076.35 And the idea there was looking
at activity and metabolism
9079.83 and prefrontal cortex.
9081.03 And what they found in these
kind of more crude scans is
9084.033 that just general
hypoactivity, hypometabolism.
9088.38 The other group right upstairs
9089.76 at the National Institute
for Neurological Diseases
9092.31 and Stroke, NINDS, they
were looking at using TMS,
9096.81 which had been around for 10 years,
9098.16 and repetitively
stimulating in motor cortex.
9101.85 And what they found was, gosh,
9103.56 we can get a readout in thumb
muscle movement amplitude
9109.2 that's really reproducible across people.
9111.51 It's like, you know,
universally reproducible.
9114.78 And if we do certain
stimulation approaches,
9117.48 they are biologically active
9119.1 to either increase excitability,
IE the thumb motion,
9122.73 and a set intensity goes up,
9125.13 the amount of amplitude goes up,
9126.81 or inhibitory or depotentiating,
9128.67 it goes down with other
biological stimulation approaches.
9132.755 And then a third outcome,
which is important,
9134.52 that it's inert, it doesn't do either.
9136.14 So you can have stimulation
approaches that do one,
9139.2 you know, increase
activity, decrease activity,
9141.57 or are inert.
9144.3 And so what they found was, oh,
9146.01 we can excite certain brain regions.
9148.02 Then my mentor, Mark George said,
9149.94 had this kind of aha moment where he said,
9152.437 "Wow, there's underactivity
in prefrontal cortex
9156.24 in depression, and we can
increase activity using this thing
9159.633 that we know we can increase
activity in motor cortex.
9162.03 We just need to put it
9163.2 in the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex."
9165.84 And then they combined the two
9168.72 and started stimulating once a day
9171.18 in this kind of very abbreviated fashion.
9173.58 And lo and behold,
9175.41 some of those depression patients
resolved their depression.
9178.59 And back then, and still today,
9180.36 you can go and as a
psychiatric patient stay
9182.61 at the National Institute of Mental Health
9184.68 and go through clinical
trials to try to get treated.
9187.32 And there were patients
who'd been there for months
9189.57 and they were able to be discharged.
9191.4 Because their mood was better, yeah.
9193.14 And so just very crude approach
9195.57 where they were using ruler
measurements where DLPFC was,
9198.687 and they were stimulating with devices
9200.52 that you needed to physically
dunk the coil in an ice bath.
9203.91 And with that, they still were able to,
9205.98 the kind of genius of
this, Mark and others,
9208.034 they would still be able
9209.575 to create a purely engineered
stimulation approach.
9214.98 What's cool about that is
9216.99 that they kind of found two things, right?
9220.2 They found this one stimulation protocol
9222.3 that does have some antidepressant effect.
9224.46 It's limited, it doesn't treat everybody,
9226.23 it does have some antidepressant effect.
9228.18 And this bigger concept that
a neuromodulation device is
9232.35 kind of like a pharmaceutical
company for you, right?
9236.61 That in a given individual,
9238.5 a TMS device or whatever
neuromodulation device is able
9242.01 to generate, you can create
a stimulation approach
9246.24 that is specific to a given condition
9249.477 and specific to an individual.
9251.88 And so the physical layer
is just how you exert that,
9256.02 similarly to how we make
pharmaceutical drugs
9258.75 in a pharmaceutical company.
9260.28 But the actual therapy
itself is what you do,
9262.86 where you do it.
9264.27 And so what we learned from, you know,
9266.58 another 20, 30 years of this is
9269.13 that you can modify the
stimulation protocol in such a way
9273.3 where you can create a whole new treatment
9275.64 and put it through the same TMS device
9277.92 or, thank god, an evolved version of it
9280.83 where you don't have
to dunk it in ice baths
9282.45 and they can actually really handle
9284.67 much more aggressive
stimulation approaches.
9287.55 And so in 2005,
9289.83 a group published in "Neuron"
a paper demonstrating
9292.62 that if you stimulate with
the hippocampal rhythms
9297.57 through a TMS coil,
9299.46 you can excite the brain
with memory rhythms
9303.69 and it'll last an hour.
9305.82 So you can change cortical excitability
9307.59 in the thumb twitch for an hour,
9309.21 sending three minutes of excitatory
9312.37 or 40 seconds in the case
of inhibitory stimulation
9315.15 that mimics hippocampal rhythms.
9317.16 So much more efficient than
the original TMS approaches.
9320.97 And so, you know, after
that group tried to do it
9323.91 in this kind of six week schedule,
9326.04 and after that, you know, and
while they were doing that,
9329.13 we decided, gosh, you know,
9330.93 this problem I talked about
at the beginning of the show
9332.67 where you have this problem
that we don't have a treatment
9336.99 for people who are
9337.823 in these high acuity psychiatric
emergency states, right?
9342.03 This idea that we are going
to engineer a treatment
9344.97 where we can reorganize the
stimulation approach in time
9349.11 to be much more efficient
by utilizing something
9352.53 called space learning theory.
9354.0 And so you probably know about
the space learning theory.
9356.07 So the idea for the viewers is,
9359.07 it's a simple psychological thing,
9360.54 but we've also seen it
in hippocampal slice
9362.49 sort of physiology too, where
if I'm cramming for a test,
9369.0 what I do is I write out 60 note cards
9371.58 and I read each one for a minute
9373.17 until I get to the first
note card and again,
9374.667 and that's about an hour later, right?
9376.89 And we just intuitively do this.
9379.145 We all, you know, automatically do that.
9382.62 And we intuit that because we
know that what doesn't work is
9386.52 writing out one note card
9387.78 and looking at it over and over again.
9389.43 Nobody ever does that, right?
9390.6 You know, we've all been in
graduate school, medical school,
9393.717 and we have these big
stacks of note cards.
9396.06 That's space learning theory.
9397.29 It's this idea that you need
to see it about every hour
9399.63 to an hour and a half and
that optimizes learning.
9402.42 If you take the same stimulation approach
9405.81 that I'm talking about,
9406.643 this data burst stimulation approach,
9407.82 and you take a hippocampal
slice of a mouse
9410.4 and you stimulate, you
enlarge some dendritic spines
9415.35 and you prime some.
9417.03 And then if you stimulate
right after that,
9419.37 you don't get any change.
9420.33 It's called in mass stimulation.
9421.77 But if you wait about an
hour to an hour and a half,
9424.86 you get more dendritic spines
enlarged and more primed.
9428.37 Which, by the way, also
is what ketamine does,
9430.32 it causes a dendritic spine enlargement.
9433.83 And so, you know, what we
found was is that the old way
9437.4 of doing TMS, this idea of
just doing it once a day,
9440.28 every day, five days a week for six weeks,
9443.04 didn't utilize the space learning theory.
9444.99 It's like studying for a month or two,
9448.32 just a little bit once a day.
9449.76 Like you remember some of that stuff,
9451.26 but it's like not as potent as that week
9453.18 where you're kind of cramming, right?
9455.1 And what we realized is
9456.21 that if we could reorganize
the stimulation in time
9459.47 so that we took the whole six week course,
9461.28 we actually figured out
a way to do it in a day.
9464.61 And then what we also figured out is
9466.14 that people were underdosing TMS
9468.24 because if you just keep
going after six weeks
9470.478 out to month three, four, five,
9472.74 more and more people got better.
9474.0 So we figured out it's not just one day,
9475.8 we're going to give five
times the normal dose.
9477.715 We're going to have 7 1/2
months' worth in five days
9480.27 using space learning theory.
9482.43 - So every hour?
9483.63 - [Nolan] Every hour for 10 hours.
9485.16 - For five days.
9485.993 - For five days.
9486.826 So it's a 50 hour block.
9487.86 It's 90 minutes of actual stimulation,
9490.68 but spread out through the day
in the same way of learning.
9493.74 Which is perfect for an inpatient
psychiatric unit, right?
9496.11 - [Andrew] Five days is manageable.
9497.34 - Yeah, you can get stimulation.
9498.9 Nobody's ever dropped out by the schedule.
9502.457 You know, folks that want
to do this, want to do it.
9505.5 So they'll do their nine minutes,
9506.46 they'll go get breakfast,
they'll do their nine minutes,
9508.44 they'll go see their
therapist or whatever it is.
9511.11 And so what we found
with this reorganization
9514.68 and time of the stimulation dose,
9518.01 and then the third component is
9519.54 we do resting state
functional connectivity scans
9522.0 on everybody.
9522.833 And we have ways now in
the last five to 10 years
9525.24 of picking out that specific
subgenual DLPFC subcircuit
9530.31 that I was talking about
earlier, that cingulate DLPFC,
9532.77 we can pick that out in every single one.
9534.24 If you want to come to the lab,
9535.2 we can find your DLPFC subgenual.
9537.9 It's even more robust than non-
9539.37 - Maybe we could stimulate
too, just while we're in there.
9540.93 - Yeah, if you want to,
9541.763 we can move around your hypnotizability.
9544.83 And we can find that spot in each person.
9549.99 Instead of finding the
same spot on the skull,
9551.73 we find the same spot on the
brain, and we can stimulate.
9554.28 And we do that every hour on the hour.
9555.54 And what we've found is that folks will,
9560.46 within one to five days, you
know, in more cases than not,
9564.36 and depending upon if you're
looking at this open label
9566.46 or in trials, somewhere
between 60 and 90% of the time,
9570.42 they will go into full on remission
9572.61 in the sense they're totally
normal from a mood standpoint
9576.27 at the end of this.
9578.55 And like I said, with variable durability.
9581.01 So that's the part we
have to figure out now
9582.45 about dosing and how to keep people well.
9584.28 But for some people, you know,
9585.3 we've had four years of remission,
9587.01 you know, year of remission.
9588.69 And it's really that cramming of the test.
9591.66 It's really that idea that
you're laying in that information
9595.47 to the exact right spot.
9597.45 And the signal is a simple
signal, but it's a profound one,
9600.24 which is turn on, stay
on, remember to stay on.
9605.88 You know, that idea that you're
sending this memory signal
9609.0 into the brain and you're
doing it in such a way
9610.8 that you're telling the system,
9612.66 you're kind of taking it out
of your own hippocampus' hand
9616.407 and you're sending the same signal
9618.06 the hippocampus normally signals out.
9620.34 Now you're sending that signal
into the prefrontal cortex
9624.15 and kind of utilizing the
brain's own communication style
9628.95 to get it to get out of the state.
9631.38 And what's very cool
about this is that people,
9635.43 when they kind of exit out of that,
9637.86 they end up saying they don't
have any side effects from it.
9643.71 And they feel back to normal.
9646.08 Like some people, you know,
9647.28 not everybody, but there's
a subsection of people
9648.783 that with SSRIs where they'll
say, I kind of feel numb,
9652.71 or I have GI side effects,
or I can't, you know,
9655.65 I don't have the sexual
interest that I used to have
9657.51 and that sort of thing.
9658.95 You know, not anything against SSRIs,
9660.96 as I said earlier, life saving, you know,
9662.7 for a subsection of people,
these things really work.
9665.22 But with this, what you see is
9667.29 that people don't talk
about any of that stuff.
9669.93 And I think it's likely
9671.7 because you're tapping
into that core circuitry
9674.85 and you're reversing it and
you're doing it with a magnet
9678.09 that, because it's a very
profound electromagnet,
9681.36 it's the same field
strength as an MRI scanner,
9684.0 it's able to induce a current in the brain
9686.91 in this focal targeted way
9689.64 without getting into
the rest of the brain,
9691.14 without getting into the
rest of the body at all.
9692.91 And just really kind of
acting only on that circuitry
9696.06 that's involved.
9697.5 - Incredible.
9698.46 Is the SAINT study still ongoing?
9700.5 And if people are interested
in potentially being patients
9705.51 or subjects in the study, can
we provide them a portal link?
9709.02 - Absolutely, yeah.
9709.853 So we have, now the treatment,
some of my students went over
9714.38 to a company called Magnus Medical,
9716.36 and they've been working on this,
9717.84 they've got an FDA clearance now.
9719.88 And now folks can get it through trials
9724.95 over the next couple of years
9726.39 because it's going to take
some time for that company
9728.28 to kind of get up and
running and get a device
9733.23 and get the whole thing set up nationally.
9735.69 But while that's all going on,
9738.03 there's still about 1,000
patients that need to be recruited
9740.94 across a bunch of different
trials all over the country.
9743.67 We'll take people from
anywhere in the country.
9745.56 We also have partners in
New York and San Diego
9748.59 and in soon to be South
Carolina and other places
9752.76 where we can actually kind of, you know,
9754.56 my lab can help to kind of
let people know where to go,
9758.22 based off of where they're at in the US,
9760.38 and get them access to
being able to be in a trial.
9762.66 And what we've tried to do is make it
9764.64 so that even if you get
the, you know, 50 50 chance,
9767.82 you're going to get the real deal
9768.99 or you're going to get the non-real deal.
9771.51 But what we have figured out is a way
9773.94 to let everyone have access.
9776.67 If they got the not real deal version,
9780.06 the kind of sham version
or the fake version,
9782.31 for the first part of the trial,
9784.29 there are other trials
where they can have access
9786.66 to the real version.
9787.56 So essentially everybody
eventually gets access
9791.22 to having the real version.
9792.9 And so that's been a big thing for me is
9794.94 I want everybody that comes
through one of our trials
9797.85 to be able to have access.
9799.05 I think it's important.
9800.779 While the company's
doing what they're doing
9803.34 and what the lab's doing,
9804.39 and kind of nationally what
other partner labs are doing.
9808.23 - Well, I can assure you, you're
going to get some interest.
9811.23 - [Nolan] Happy to have it, yeah.
9812.063 - Thank you.
9812.97 And listen,
9814.62 thank you so much for taking
us on this incredible voyage
9820.14 through the neurocircuitry
underlying certain aspects
9823.65 of depression,
9824.483 the coverage of the different
types of depression,
9826.26 the various therapeutic
compounds, how they work.
9829.08 We've talked about a lot of things today.
9831.42 You've shared so much knowledge,
and even as I say that,
9834.39 I very much want to have you back
9836.64 to talk about many other things as well
9838.65 that we didn't have time to cover,
9839.85 but also just really want to thank you
9841.92 for the work that you do.
9843.6 I know we are colleagues,
9844.62 but you run an enormous
laboratory, enormous in my book.
9848.19 40 people is a big group, very big group.
9851.61 Plus you're in the clinic,
9852.9 you also have a life of
your own outside of work.
9856.44 And to take the time to sit down with us
9858.27 and share all this knowledge
that really is in service
9860.94 to mental health and human feeling better
9865.35 and in fact avoiding
often suicidal depression.
9868.11 It's just incredible work
and incredible generosity.
9870.93 And just thank you so much.
9872.67 - Oh, thank you, man.
9873.503 I mean, you know, similarly
I want to thank you
9876.24 for what you're doing.
9877.073 I mean, I think that what you, you know,
9879.32 I've got a lot of friends,
9880.32 folks that are not in
the medical profession,
9882.24 friends of mine, you know,
9883.77 one of my buddies who's
a real estate agent
9885.6 who works with us, who's a
big, big fan of your show.
9888.69 And you know, I told a
couple people like that
9890.55 I was coming on and they
were like super stoked.
9894.9 They're like, you know,
we watch every show
9897.66 and, you know, super
excited to watch mine.
9902.01 And they said something very
important to me that, you know,
9905.22 you make this complicated neuroscience
9908.97 and kind of brain-body
science accessible, you know,
9913.77 in a way that few have a gift to do.
9917.28 And I think that that's so important
9920.49 and this show is doing so much
9922.32 to help with science literacy.
9924.72 And yeah, appreciate you, so...
9927.66 - Well, thank you.
9928.77 I'm gratified and
honored by your statement
9931.62 and I look forward to more.
9934.35 Thank you.
9935.183 - Absolutely, thank you.
9936.016 - Thank you for joining me today
9936.849 for my discussion with Dr. Nolan Williams.
9939.09 I hope you found our discussion
9940.32 about psychedelics and other compounds,
9942.57 about transcranial magnetic stimulation,
9945.42 and about the treatments
for depression in general,
9948.06 to be as stimulating as I did.

10005.083 but in many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
10007.52 we talk about supplements.
10008.81 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
10011.0 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them
10013.04 for things like enhancing sleep and focus
10015.02 and hormone optimization.
10016.67 The Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered
10018.14 with Momentous supplements.
