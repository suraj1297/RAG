0.35 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast
2.3 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.93 for everyday life.
6.248 [bright guitar music]
9.25 I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm
a professor of neurobiology
11.9 and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.
14.96 Today we are talking
about time perception.
18.08 Our perception of time is
perhaps the most important factor
21.96 in how we gauge our life,
24.07 that is whether or not we
think we are being successful,
27.01 whether or not we are failing,
28.54 whether or not we live in fear,
30.31 whether or not we live
in relation to things
32.47 in a way that's positive,
and the reason for that
35.44 is that our perception of
time is directly linked
38.39 to the neurochemical
states that control mood,
41.23 stress, happiness, excitement,
44.07 and of course it frames the way
46.13 in which we evaluate our past,
48.72 so whether or not we think of our past
50.67 as successful or unsuccessful.
53.47 It frames our present,
54.67 whether or not we think we
are on track or off track.
57.43 And it frames our sense of the future,
59.88 whether or not we think
we have a bright future,
62.53 a dim future,
63.45 or whether or not the future
is very uncertain or not.
67.29 Today, we're going to
talk about the science
68.9 of time perception and we
are going to talk about tools
72.17 and protocols that you can use
that can enhance your ability
77.03 to dilate and contract time.
79.06 What do we mean by
dilate and contract time?
81.97 We can control the speed at
which we experience life.
85.5 We can slow things down
87.27 or we can speed our experience of life up.
89.92 And we can do that in a
very direct and dynamic way.
93.01 It's actually not that hard
94.49 once you understand how
time perception works.
96.68 So that's where we're headed.
97.56 I think you're going to come
away from today's episode
99.73 with a lot of new knowledge
and certainly with many tools
103.66 that you can try in your daily life,
105.33 whether or not that's work, sport,
106.8 relational, emotional, and so on.
109.44 Before we begin our discussion
about time perception,
112.46 I'd like to answer some
questions that I received
115.0 related to the episode on fasting
117.13 and time-restricted feeding.
118.89 If you haven't seen that episode,
120.13 this information should
still be of use to you.
122.87 Time-restricted feeding involves eating
125.05 for a particular period of time
126.56 in each 24-hour cycle
that's fairly regular.
129.73 So this would be an eight-hour most often
132.22 or a 10-hour block.
133.29 Some people do shorter feeding
windows, but regardless,
136.72 that feeding window is supposed to fall
138.1 at more or less the same
period within each 24-hour day.
140.84 This has a number of positive
effects on gene expression
143.84 that regulate a number of positive effects
145.51 on the different tissues of
the body, and for some people,
148.18 not all, but for some people
makes weight loss easier
151.96 because of the way that
they are not eating
154.07 for large periods of each 24-hour cycle.
156.86 In any event, one of the
major questions I got
159.49 after that episode was do
supplements break a fast?
164.04 And during that episode,
164.97 I talked about what breaks
a fast is highly contextual.
168.3 It basically boils down
169.48 to whether or not something you ingest,
172.26 whether it be liquid or food,
174.57 increases your resting blood glucose,
176.5 how much it increases that
resting blood glucose,
179.01 and how long that increase lasts.
181.8 So you can check out the episode
183.01 for more about what breaks a fast,
185.5 but to address this
issue about supplements
188.22 and whether or not supplements
in particular break a fast,
190.95 many of the questions were
about Athletic Greens.
193.59 Athletic Greens is a
sponsor of this podcast.
196.53 It is also a terrific
supplement that I'd been taking
199.07 for more than a decade
before this podcast launched.
202.0 And many people have been using
204.39 and continue to use Athletic Greens.
206.88 Does Athletic Greens break a fast?
208.96 Well, that will somewhat depend
210.26 on whether or not your
resting blood glucose
212.43 tends to run high or
low, but for most people,
215.08 including me, because I've measured it,
217.17 ingesting Athletic Greens
does not break a fast
219.61 and if it happens to break a fast,
221.21 it would be a very
transient break in fast.
223.84 So without knowing your
resting blood glucose levels
226.58 on an individual basis, there's
no way I can say for sure
229.09 that it doesn't break a fast,
but chances are it does not
231.92 because it doesn't contain
much carbohydrate or sugar
235.42 and it doesn't tend to therefore pull you
238.72 out of the molecular mill you associated
241.34 with low blood glucose states.
244.28 The other question I get
is whether or not things
246.24 like fish oil break a
fast, and once again,
249.6 this will be contextual,
251.01 but because fish oil is
a fat, an essential fat,
253.93 mainly essential fatty acids,
in particular EPA and DHA,
258.44 those don't tend to raise
blood glucose very much.
260.92 In my case, having measured
262.79 using a continuous glucose
monitor my resting blood glucose,
265.94 fish oil does not in any way change
267.75 my resting blood glucose.
269.68 Chances are it won't do that
for most people as well.
272.19 So does fish oil break a
fast? Chances are it does not.
276.23 And of course people wanted to know
277.87 about pill-type supplements, you know,
279.89 caffeine and things that raise dopamine
282.01 and their vitamins and minerals.
283.49 In general, if something
doesn't contain sugar
286.27 or much carbohydrate of any kind,
289.33 it's not going to raise
blood glucose very much.
291.54 Now, of course, protein
can raise blood glucose
293.53 and fat can too as well,
although to a lesser extent.
297.28 So again, this is all contextual,
299.03 but at least by the logic
that I just spelled out,
302.13 Athletic Greens, fish oil,
and most forms of supplements,
305.82 provided they don't have any
sugar or protein content,
308.74 should not quote unquote break a fast.
311.74 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
313.56 that this podcast is
separate from my teaching
315.81 and research roles at Stanford.
317.57 It is however part of my desire and effort
319.84 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
322.237 and science-related tools
to the general public.
325.04 In keeping with that theme,
326.07 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
328.9 Our first sponsor is ROKA.
331.18 ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
333.03 that are of the absolute highest quality.
335.66 I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system
338.08 and one of the key things
about our visual system
340.08 is that it's designed so
that when you move into areas
343.02 where it's sunny or
where there are shadows,
345.67 you can still see things
with crystal clarity.
348.86 Many sunglasses out there have the problem
351.03 that you have to keep taking them off
352.67 and putting them back on
353.52 depending on the overall
so-called ambient environment
356.64 that you're in.
357.51 ROKA sunglasses have solved this problem
360.38 and their eyeglasses
also have super clarity
363.86 regardless of overall
ambient lighting, as we say.
366.53 In other words, you see
everything very clearly
368.4 no matter where you are.
370.51 They also come in a number
of different styles.
372.25 The aesthetics are really terrific.
373.62 So unlike a lot of
performance glasses out there
375.333 that make people look like cyborgs,
377.36 you can wear them anywhere.
378.193 You can wear them to dinner.
379.08 You can wear them to school or work
380.37 or in social engagements and
you can wear them running
382.29 and cycling and out doing
your various activities.
385.18 If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,
386.61 you can go to ROKA that's R-O-K-A, .com
389.32 and enter the code Huberman
390.74 to save 20% off your first order.
393.3 Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.
396.23 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
397.69 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
400.16 I started using Athletic
Greens way back in 2012
403.17 and so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.
405.83 The reason that I started
using Athletic Greens
407.74 and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens
409.27 once or twice every day is that it covers
411.89 all of my foundational needs for vitamins,
414.07 minerals, and probiotics.
415.81 In fact, when people ask me
417.39 what supplements they should take,
419.41 if I were going to recommend
just one supplement,
421.17 it would be Athletic Greens
because of the enormous number
423.92 of biological factors that
it impacts in a positive way.
427.77 It has, as I mentioned,
vitamins and minerals.
429.63 The probiotics are really
important for the gut microbiome
432.61 and gut health which is
important for the immune system
435.43 and for brain health and for mood
437.23 and a number of other important factors
439.15 including hormones and so on.
440.96 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
442.42 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
445.33 to claim their special offer.
446.86 They'll give you five free travel packs
448.51 which make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens
450.48 while you're on the road or in the car.
452.27 And they'll give you a year's
supply of vitamin D3 K2.
455.8 Vitamin D3 and K2 have been
shown to be really important
459.51 for a number of important
aspects of your immediate
462.77 and long-term health
including blood lipid profiles
465.36 and a number of other things.
466.62 Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
469.45 to get the Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs,
471.6 and the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.
474.66 Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
477.368 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
479.82 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
482.21 to help you better understand your body
483.77 and help you reach your health goals.
485.88 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
488.34 for the simple reason
that many of the factors
490.84 that impact your immediate
and long-term health
492.65 can only be analyzed
from a quality blood test
495.31 and it's for that reason
that I get my blood work done
498.08 once every four to six months.
499.9 Might seem like a lot,
but it has been vital
502.48 in order to keep my health where I want it
504.93 and to ensure that my
health trajectory is heading
507.34 in the direction that I'd like it to go
509.05 with each passing year.
510.94 The other thing about InsideTracker
is they have DNA tests
513.83 which can tell you about the
specific makeup of your genes
516.75 that can impact your particular nutrition,
520.12 lifestyle, and supplementation regimes.
522.48 They can also help you
steer your immediate
524.52 and long-term health in the
direction that you want to go.
527.31 They make the whole thing very, very easy.
529.55 You can have the blood test taken at home
531.21 or you can go to a local clinic.
533.0 Then the results come back
and the wonderful thing is
536.16 the platform, the dashboard that they use
538.55 walks you through your data
540.41 and points to specific
things related to nutrition.
543.43 Maybe you should be eating
more of certain things,
545.85 eating less of others, supplementing
in certain ways or not.
549.71 And lifestyle factors like exercise
552.04 in order to bring the
numbers into the ranges
554.0 that are right for your
immediate and long-term health.

566.14 So let's talk about time perception
568.07 and the most fundamental
aspect of time perception
570.56 is something called entrainment.
572.74 Entrainment is the way in
which your internal processes,
576.63 your biology and your psychology,
579.08 are linked to some external thing.
582.34 And the most basic form of entrainment
584.44 that we are all a slave to all year round
588.71 for our entire life are
so-called circannual rhythms.
593.76 We have neurons, nerve cells
in our eye, in our brain,
598.45 and in our body that are
marking off the passage of time
603.28 throughout the year,
604.42 literally a calendar system
in your brain and body.
607.19 And the way this works
is beautifully simple.
611.32 Light seen by your eyes
inhibits, meaning it reduces,
616.84 the amount of a hormone released
618.47 in your brain called melatonin.
621.39 Melatonin has two major functions.
623.91 One function is to make
you sleepy at night
626.17 and the other is to regulate
some of the other hormones
629.29 of the body, in particular
testosterone and estrogen.
633.46 When we view light,
635.09 we reduce the amount
of melatonin released.
637.1 In fact, if you wake up in
the middle of the night,
638.93 when melatonin typically is
pretty high in your brain
641.47 and body and you flip on a
bright light in the bathroom,
644.62 your melatonin levels crash down
646.66 to almost zero and stay there.
649.55 Light is a very powerful
modulator of melatonin
652.86 and light inhibits melatonin.
656.42 Throughout the year,
depending on where you live,
659.05 day length varies, and as a consequence,
662.1 the amount of light from the sun
664.86 that is available to you varies.
667.32 So when days are long,
the amount of melatonin
670.97 in your brain and body that's
released tends to be less.
674.42 There's less of it and it's released
675.95 for shorter amounts of time, okay?
678.4 Because light inhibits melatonin.
680.5 When days are very short,
the amount of melatonin
683.46 that's released and the duration
that that melatonin exists
686.65 in your brain and body
tends to be much longer.
689.36 So melatonin correlates with day length.
693.87 And if we are viewing more
light, we have less melatonin.
697.36 We view less light, we
have more melatonin.
702.7 You see different
amounts of light each day
705.48 but we have a process
in our brain and body
708.93 that averages the amount
of light that you're seeing
711.3 both from artificial
sources and from sunlight
713.84 and measures that off, and
it's so exquisitely precise
718.68 that for a given, say,
eight-hour day in the spring,
723.25 'cause spring in the Northern
Hemisphere or elsewhere,
725.67 you know, days are getting longer,
728.73 that means that the amount of melatonin
731.18 is getting progressively less and less
733.43 and that signal is
conveyed to all the systems
735.7 of your brain and body.
737.07 And this is why most people, not all,
738.9 but most people feel like
they have more energy
741.28 in the spring.
742.9 Conversely, when you
have an eight-hour day
745.86 in the winter, the amount of melatonin
749.17 that corresponds to that eight-hour day
751.7 is getting progressively
greater and greater because why?
755.51 Days are getting shorter
so melatonin is increasing
758.66 from day to day to day.
760.52 Every cell and system of your
body pays attention to this,
762.91 and as a consequence,
most people, not all,
764.68 but most people feel
they have a little less
766.97 or sometimes a lot less energy
768.62 and a slightly lower mood
in the winter months.
771.52 Now, there are exceptions
to this, of course,
773.83 but the melatonin signal is the way
776.67 in which your internal state, your mood,
780.26 your sense of energy, even
your appetite is entrained,
784.91 is matched to some external event.
787.21 In this case, the event is the rotation
789.47 of the Earth around the sun.
791.38 There are other forms of entrainment,
793.6 meaning the matching
of your brain and body
796.07 to things that are happening
in your external environment.
798.84 One particularly
interesting example of this
800.88 was published last year by
Parikh et al. in "Cell Reports,"
804.01 Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
806.0 showing that across the calendar year,
808.77 the amount of testosterone and estrogen
811.32 that human beings make varies
813.78 such that in longer days,
815.87 they tend to make more
testosterone and estrogen
818.31 than in shorter days.
819.47 And this was correlated
with things like desire
822.23 to seek out romantic partners
or have romantic interactions
825.13 with their existing
partners, even aggression,
828.26 although not violent aggression,
830.87 but sense of kind of willingness to argue
833.02 and to get into kind of combative states
836.2 and overall energy and mood.
838.37 This is something that had been
hypothesized for a long time
840.61 but it had never really
been cleanly demonstrated.
842.98 And what they showed was
that it's actually the skin
846.69 that's taking information
about the amount of light
849.01 and converting it into these increases
850.99 in testosterone and estrogen.
852.73 Light exposure to the skin,
turns out about two hours a day,
857.53 this was sunlight, in this
case, to the upper body,
859.41 these people weren't naked,
they were wearing clothes
861.11 but their arms were exposed,
863.01 their upper back and neck
and face were exposed,
865.18 they were not wearing hats,
resulted in large increases,
869.88 significant increases in
testosterone and estrogen.
872.72 Now you could probably export
a tool from that if you liked.
875.63 That's not really what
this podcast is about
877.29 but it's very clear that
because the skin is acting
880.72 as an endocrine orman, organ, excuse me,
882.93 as kind of a hormone-influencing organ,
886.16 that getting light on the
skin, not just to the eyes,
889.13 can influence our sense of wellbeing
891.61 by these hormone pathways,
and the threshold there again
894.62 seemed to be about two hours a day.
896.01 It doesn't have to be very bright outside.
897.69 There can be cloud cover and so on.
899.35 Many people will probably ask
901.8 will sunscreen inhibit this effect?
903.64 And it doesn't appear that it does.
905.64 Obviously prioritize skin
health and avoiding skin cancer.
909.99 Sunscreen is kind of a
controversial topic nowadays,
912.232 maybe the topic for another
podcast episode at some point,
916.37 but nonetheless, what the
Parikh et al. study shows
919.51 and that's most relevant
to today's podcast
921.4 is that we are entrained, we are matched
924.65 to the external light-dark cycle
926.45 and as the day length
changes, our hormones change.
929.65 And we can override that with
exposure to bright lights.
933.13 You know, people go sit on tanning beds.
935.42 That's not a practice I
particularly myself engage in,
938.48 but, you know, there are
a number of different ways
939.6 that people can override these processes.
941.76 But the point is very simple.
944.28 The point is that our perception
of time is both conscious,
949.22 you know, it's waiting,
watching the clock tick down,
952.11 and there are these slower,
what we call oscillatory,
954.74 meaning up and down repeatedly,
slower oscillatory events
958.26 related to day length that
are influencing our hormones
961.31 like melatonin,
testosterone, and estrogen,
963.21 and therefore our mood, our
outlook, and even our behavior.
966.44 The next level of time or
bin of time, as we say,
971.69 that we are all entrained or matched to
974.95 is the so-called circadian time cycle,
977.64 which is 24-hour rhythm.
980.09 This is perhaps the most powerful rhythm
983.61 that we all contain and that
none of us can escape from.
988.7 We all have this circadian clock
990.93 that resides over the roof of our mouth.
992.8 The cells in that circadian clock fire,
995.65 meaning they release chemicals
into our brain and body
999.99 on a very regular rhythm.
1001.34 So across the 24-hour cycle,
1004.08 they will be very active at some periods
1006.36 and less active at others.
1009.13 Not surprisingly, there are
periods of every 24-hour cycle
1012.27 when we are very active
and we tend to be alert
1014.79 and others when we are asleep.
1017.07 Now, I've talked a lot
about circadian rhythms
1018.84 and sleep on this podcast previously
1021.12 and so I don't want to repeat
too much of that information
1023.33 in detail, but I'm just
going to give a summary
1025.15 of how circadian entrainment works
1027.17 because I haven't really covered that
1030.06 in the context of time perception.
1033.41 We have the circadian
clock. It oscillates.
1036.03 It goes up and down once every
24 hours and then repeats.
1039.83 Every cell of our body
has a 24-hour oscillation
1042.86 in the expression of various genes.
1044.85 How that works is actually really simple,
1046.75 elegant, and interesting.
1049.2 DNA, genes, make RNA. RNA
is converted into proteins.
1055.6 Every cell in our body has
this beautiful 24-hour timer
1059.92 where a gene is expressed.
1062.15 And the important thing to
understand about a given gene
1065.65 in this context is that
that gene is inhibited,
1069.26 meaning it's reduced,
by a particular protein,
1072.77 by a little biological
molecule in that cell.
1075.85 So the gene gets expressed
when there's very little
1079.44 of that other molecule around.
1081.37 DNA then becomes RNA.
1083.51 RNA is translated into a protein
1086.57 and that protein goes way, way
up and the gene shuts down.
1089.73 But as that protein gets used up
1092.43 and its levels eventually
drop low, low, low, low, low
1094.66 to zero, the gene cycle kicks in again
1097.307 and the gene gets expressed.
1098.57 The RNA gets expressed
in the protein again.
1101.31 This all happens on a 24-hour cycle.
1103.62 So it's a little built-in timer
1105.11 in each and every one of our cells.
1106.64 And I didn't list off the genes,
1107.92 but for the aficionados out there,
1109.29 they go by names like
PER for period, BMAL,
1111.98 CLOCK, and all these different things.
1113.16 We call them the clock genes
and those clock genes regulate
1115.61 a number of different functions.
1116.59 So every cell in our
body has a 24-hour cycle
1119.4 of gene and protein expression
1121.52 and the Earth rotates once every 24 hours
1124.86 and the processes that are happening
1126.81 in every cell of our body are linked.
1129.74 They are entrained, as we say,
1131.55 to the outside light-dark cycle
1133.18 because morning sunlight,
evening sunlight,
1138.28 and the lack of light in
the middle of the night
1142.24 make sure that the changes,
1145.2 these oscillations that are occurring
1146.97 within the cells of our
brain and body are matched
1149.87 to the outside light-dark cycle.
1151.22 Don't want to go into all the
details of how that happens
1153.7 but there's some very simple
tools that one can use
1156.17 to ensure that your entrainment,
1158.65 your circadian entrainment, is precise.
1161.62 And I cannot emphasize
enough how important it is
1164.7 that your circadian
entrainment be precise, why?
1169.15 Because disruptions in
circadian entrainment
1171.87 cause huge health problems.
1173.3 They increase cancer risk.
They increase obesity.
1176.49 They increase mental health issues.
1178.85 They decrease wound healing.
1181.24 They decrease physical
and mental performance.
1183.48 They disrupt hormones.
1184.8 You want your cells to be
linked to the circadian cycle
1188.66 that's outside you and the
circadian cycle outside you
1191.17 mainly consists of when there's sunlight
1194.03 and when there is not.
1194.96 And that's why the simple protocols
1196.94 to fall out of this whole discussion
1199.18 about circadian entrainment
are the following.
1201.73 View 10 to 30 minutes of bright light,
1203.5 ideally sunlight, within an hour of waking
1206.44 assuming that you're waking
early in the day especially.
1208.65 You wake up early in the day,
get outside, see sunlight.
1210.88 Do that again in the
afternoon or around evening,
1214.01 10 to 30 minutes, depending
on how bright it is outside.
1217.04 Artificial lights throughout the day,
1219.09 or if you want to be awake
and you wake up early
1221.97 and there's no sunlight outside,
1223.59 you can of course turn
on artificial lights
1225.42 if you want to be awake
but basically you want
1227.0 as much bright light,
ideally from sunlight,
1229.314 coming in through your
eyes throughout the day.
1231.69 And then in the evening,
1232.99 you want as little bright light
coming in through your eyes.
1236.34 I've said this over and over
and over again on this podcast.
1238.77 There's always a lot of negotiations,
1240.27 but I want to make a few things clear.
1241.97 Try not to wear sunglasses
if you can do it safely.
1244.3 Fine to wear eye glasses or contacts.
1246.38 That's not going be a problem.
1249.61 The light viewing that you
do and the avoidance of light
1252.24 at night set the fundamental
layer of your time perception.
1259.64 One of the best ways to
disrupt your perception of time
1262.48 in the ways that we're going to talk about
1263.95 in the subsequent portions of the podcast
1266.28 is to disrupt your circadian clock
1268.01 and that is not a good thing
1269.49 for a number of different reasons.
1271.44 There are other ways
1272.273 to so-called entrain your circadian clock.
1274.33 One of the best ways
to do that is to engage
1277.36 in physical activity at
fairly regular times of day.
1280.71 You don't have to do it every day
1281.76 but if you're going to exercise,
1283.39 try and exercise at a fairly
consistent time of day.
1286.02 Probably better to exercise
than to not exercise,
1289.08 even if you have to move that time of day,
1291.41 but light activity and,
we'll talk about the third
1294.74 in a minute, food, are the major ways
1296.97 that you entrain your
internal perception of time
1300.18 to the external events of the world,
1303.68 meaning the turning of the Earth
1305.56 and therefore the exposure
to sunlight or not.
1308.73 So in addition to sunlight
viewing in the morning
1312.86 and throughout the day
and avoiding bright light
1314.42 at night of any kind, not just blue light,
1316.77 trying to get your activity,
1318.01 your exercise at fairly regular,
1320.12 within plus or minus two hours,
from each day to the next
1324.03 is going to have a very positive effect
1325.92 on so-called circadian entrainment,
1328.14 and also eating at fairly regular times.
1330.79 However, this is exciting.
1333.24 The data mainly point to the
fact that you need to eat
1335.72 within more or less the
same time window each day,
1338.91 not that you always need to eat your meals
1340.93 at exactly the same time.
1342.77 So you don't necessarily
have to eat lunch at noon
1346.04 and a snack at four and dinner at eight
1348.39 in order to keep your
circadian entrainment
1350.69 aligned or sharp.
1353.48 You could for instance
have a small snack at noon
1355.56 and then eat at two and
then have dinner at six
1357.67 and then a small snack at eight.
1358.79 It doesn't so much matter
when the exact meals fall
1362.51 so much as that they fall more or less
1364.1 within a consistent period or
phase of each 24-hour cycle.
1370.56 What happens when this circadian clock
1373.23 starts getting disrupted?
1374.37 I mean, this is after all an
episode about time perception.
1377.19 It's not an episode about
circadian rhythms and entrainment.
1380.38 Well, there's a classic
study by Aschoff done in 1985
1385.87 that's now been repeated many times
1387.64 where they had people go into environments
1390.13 where they didn't have clocks
and they didn't have windows
1392.51 and they didn't have watches
1394.05 and they were sometimes
even in constant dark
1395.79 or constant light, and they evaluated
1398.99 how well people perceive
the passage of time
1402.53 on shorter timescales
1404.24 and what they found
was really interesting.
1405.79 What they found is that
people underestimate
1408.19 how long they were in these
isolated environments.
1410.21 So after 42 days or so, they'd ask people
1413.34 how long do you think you've been in here?
1414.5 And people would say 28 days or 36 days.
1418.18 They generally underestimated
how long they had been
1421.17 in this very odd
environment with no clocks
1423.4 or watches or exposure to sunlight
1424.91 or regular rhythms of artificial light.
1428.34 In addition, they found
that their perception
1431.78 of shorter time intervals
was also really disrupted.
1435.43 So if they ask them to
measure off two minutes,
1438.071 normally people are pretty good
1439.75 at measuring off two minutes.
1440.76 People come within, you know,
5 to 15 seconds at most.
1445.07 If you'd kind of have to
sit there and just wait,
1447.5 you have a pretty good idea
of when two minutes is up.
1449.117 You say two minutes is up.
1450.65 Well, when people's circadian clocks
1453.14 or circadian entrainment, I
should say, was disrupted,
1456.11 their perception of time
measurement on shorter timescales
1460.8 of minutes or even seconds
was greatly disrupted.
1464.21 And as we'll see in a couple of minutes,
1465.75 that actually causes great problems
1468.42 for how you contend with work,
1470.28 how you contend with
challenges of different kinds.
1473.1 You want your circadian
entrainment to be pretty locked in
1477.92 or pretty entrained to the
outside light-dark cycle
1480.9 so that your perception of time
1483.05 on shorter time intervals can be precise
1486.21 because the ability to
perceive time accurately
1488.91 for the given task or given thing
1491.25 that you're involved in turns out
1492.91 to be one of the most
fundamental ways that predicts
1496.12 how well or poorly you
perform that thing or task.
1499.63 So we've talked about
circannual entrainment,
1502.49 the matching of the cells and
tissues and organs of our body
1505.65 to the 365-day journey
that the Earth takes
1509.46 around the sun each year
1511.35 and we talked about circadian entrainment,
1513.87 the way that the 24-hour
genetic and protein clocks
1518.23 of each and every one
of our cells is matched
1520.99 to the rotation of the Earth on its axis
1523.74 and the exposure or lack
of exposure to the sun
1528.2 because of that rotation on its axis.
1531.0 Next I'd like to talk about
so-called ultradian entrainment.
1534.825 Ultradian rhythms are rhythms
of about 90 minutes or so
1538.93 and all of our existence is broken up
1541.67 into these 90-minute ultradian cycles.
1544.23 When you go to sleep at night,
1545.47 whether or not you sleep
six hours or four hours
1547.24 or eight hours or 10 hours,
1549.08 that entire period of sleep is broken up
1551.74 into these 90-minute ultradian cycles.
1554.29 Early in the night, you tend
to have more slow-wave sleep.
1556.29 Later in the night, you
tend to have more REM sleep.
1558.35 But nonetheless, your sleep is broken up
1560.74 into these 90-minute cycles.
1562.44 However, when you wake up in the morning,
1564.69 many of the things that
you do are governed
1567.81 by these ultradian rhythms.
1570.98 For instance, if you were to work,
1574.15 meaning do math or try
and learn a language
1577.32 or do physical work of
any kind or work out,
1580.94 the 90-minute time block
seems to be the one
1583.82 in which the brain can
enter a state of focus
1587.21 and alertness and do hard
work and focus, focus, focus
1589.68 and then at about 90 minutes,
there's a significant drop
1594.38 in your ability to engage in
this mental or physical work.
1598.09 Now, everybody from, you
know, the self-help literature
1602.45 to the business literature to
the pop psychology literature
1605.42 has tried to leverage
these ultradian cycles
1608.06 by saying if you're going
to do something hard
1610.75 and you want to focus on it,
limit it to 90 minutes or less.
1613.14 And I am one of those people
1614.19 who's also joined that conversation
1615.88 and indeed I use 90-minute work cycles,
1618.13 and I think they are extremely powerful.
1620.73 One should never expect
1621.78 that you're going to drop immediately
1623.19 into a state of high
focus at the beginning
1625.71 and then remain there for 90 minutes.
1627.64 We all struggle to varying
degrees to achieve focus
1630.91 and motivation and drive
within those 90-minute cycles.
1633.64 But it is true, meaning
there is ample literature
1637.54 to support the idea that
after about 90 minutes,
1641.76 we tend to go into a state
of less ability to focus.
1645.48 So while this isn't
time perception per se,
1648.95 it is again an example of entrainment.
1651.81 What are we entraining to, right?
1654.22 Just because we can focus for 90 minutes
1656.06 and then not so well at
100 minutes or 120 minutes,
1659.6 what are we entraining to?
1660.69 Well, what you're
entraining to is the release
1662.49 of particular neurochemicals,
1664.921 in this case, acetylcholine and dopamine
1667.23 that allow your brain to focus
1669.17 for particular periods of
time, 90 minutes or so,
1672.28 and after about 90 minutes or so,
1675.54 the amount of those chemicals
that can be released
1677.66 tends to drop very low,
1678.63 which is why your ability
to focus becomes diminished.
1682.81 If one would like to explore
more about the kind of backbone
1685.64 and basis of these ultradian rhythms,
1688.72 it goes by a different name.
1689.92 This was originally called
the basic rest-activity cycle.
1693.99 This was proposed many years
ago by Nathaniel Kleitman.
1697.66 It was established to be true
1699.68 within sleep states as I mentioned before.
1701.93 Then it was debated for a long time
1703.47 whether or not these
90-minute cycles also control
1707.03 our ability to focus and
perform work in wakeful states
1710.04 and it turns out that they do.
1711.06 Now there's a lot of
literature to support that.
1713.86 I always get the question how do you know
1715.47 when the 90 minute cycle begins?
1717.19 In other words, let's
say you wake up at 8 AM
1720.24 and you just finished a
90-minute sleep cycle.
1722.37 Does that mean that your
next 90-minute cycle
1725.13 where you could do work
begins right at 8:01?
1727.72 No, the interesting thing
1729.73 about these basic rest-activity cycles,
1731.76 these ultradian rhythms,
1733.06 is that you can initiate
them whenever you want.
1736.14 This is not like a circadian rhythm
1737.86 which is a hardwired
unerring signal of 24 hours.
1743.05 The ultradian rhythms that occur
1744.68 during sleep are hardwired, unerring.
1748.87 You don't get the option
of making your sleep cycles
1751.28 120 minutes or five minutes.
1753.51 You don't get that option.
1755.69 But if you decide that you
want to apply ultradian rhythms
1758.63 to work and performance,
you can set a clock
1761.44 and decide, okay, now the focus begins.
1764.27 Now the work begins and this
90-minute cycle is the period
1767.49 in which I'm going to do work.
1768.69 And I actually do this, you know,
1770.26 mid morning and sometimes twice a day,
1772.04 I do a 90-minute cycle where
I limit all distraction
1775.76 as much as possible, put away my phone,
1777.37 often turn off the internet as well.
1778.8 I talked about this in an episode
1780.57 on kind of an optimal
workday, at least for me,
1784.56 just to give an example
of how this might work.
1786.73 But I want to emphasize again
1788.91 that these ultradian rhythms
are ones that you set.
1792.09 So you decide I'm going
to work for 90 minutes.
1794.65 What you can't negotiate, however,
1796.68 is that at about 100
minutes or 120 minutes,
1799.8 no matter who you are,
1800.77 you're going to see a
diminishment in performance.
1803.72 You're not going to focus as well.
1805.94 And that's again because of the way
1807.31 that these 90-minute cycles
are linked to the ability
1810.05 of the neurons that release
acetylcholine and dopamine
1812.75 and to some extent norepinephrine,
1814.11 the things that give us narrow focus,
1815.63 motivation, and drive, the way
1817.36 that these 90-minute cycles
are involved in those circuits.
1821.95 After about 90 minutes,
1823.08 those circuits are far
less willing to engage
1825.7 and therefore it's much harder to continue
1828.6 to focus to a high degree.
1830.69 Some people like to do
multiple 90-minute cycles
1833.01 per day of focus.
1833.88 In that case, you need
to separate them out.
1835.62 You can't do one 90-minute cycle,
1837.27 then go right into
another 90-minute cycle,
1839.06 then another 90-minutes cycle.
1840.19 You can't cheat these circuits
related to acetylcholine
1843.26 and dopamine and
norepinephrine unfortunately.
1846.29 I suggest that people
do no more than three
1849.22 and ideally it would be two
1851.02 or just one of these 90-minute cycles.
1853.38 Why did I say ideally?
Well, they are very taxing.
1856.62 You are in a very narrow tunnel of focus.
1859.37 So for me, I can do one mid morning.
1862.04 I can probably do another
one in the afternoon.
1864.27 This is not the kind of work
that's like checking email
1866.41 or text messaging or social media.
1867.88 This is very focused hard work,
1869.759 working on hard problems of various kinds,
1872.73 and this will be different for everybody.
1874.77 So I recommend that they be spaced
1876.27 by at least two to four hours
1878.65 and most people probably won't be able
1880.69 to handle more than two per day.
1882.58 There are probably some mutants out there
1884.28 that could do three or four,
but that's exceedingly rare.
1887.28 I think even one a day is going to feel
1889.23 like a significant mental investment,
1891.5 and afterwards you're
going to feel pretty taxed.
1893.87 So now we've talked about circannual,
1895.81 circadian, and ultradian rhythms,
1899.07 but we haven't really talked
about time perception per se.
1902.41 We've mainly talked
1903.41 about the subconscious
slow oscillatory ways
1907.05 in which we are entrained
or matched to the year
1909.79 or to the day and these ultradian cycles
1912.88 that we can impose on our work
1915.41 and that we can leverage
toward more focus if we like.
1920.07 But what about the actual
perception of time?
1922.05 What actually controls how fast
1924.53 or how slowly we perceive time going by?
1928.3 There are basically three
forms of time perception
1931.09 that we should all be aware of.
1932.82 One is our perception of the
passage of time in the present,
1935.76 how quickly or slowly things
seem to be happening for us.
1939.53 This is kind of like an
interval timer ticking off time.
1942.66 Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
1944.38 It's either fine-slicing like that,
1946.36 or tick, tick, tick.
1949.85 We have interval timers.
1951.46 I'll discuss the basis
of those interval timers.
1953.75 We also engage in what's
called prospective timing
1956.46 which is like a stopwatch
measuring off things
1958.82 as they go forward.
1960.26 That might sound a little bit
like what I just described
1962.19 but it's actually a little bit different.
1964.27 For instance, if I told
you to start measuring off
1968.9 a two-minute time
interval into the future,
1971.84 you could do that pretty well.
1974.75 But if I told you you had to measure
1976.01 a five-minute time
interval into the future
1978.41 and you couldn't use any clocks or watches
1980.3 or your phone or anything like that,
1982.27 you would have to set the tick marks.
1985.36 You'd have to decide how many
times you were going to count off
1989.28 during that five-minute time block.
1991.98 There's also retrospective time
1994.1 which is how you measure
off time in the past.
1997.72 So if I say, you know, last week,
2000.44 I know you went to the park,
2001.78 you did some things
with friends, you know,
2003.3 you went out in the evening.
2005.36 How long was it between lunch
2008.06 and when you went to dinner with friends?
2009.34 You'd probably think, okay, well,
2010.49 I remember I went to dinner at seven
2011.94 and we had lunch right around two.
2013.88 You're using memory to
reconstruct certain sets of events
2017.98 in the past and get a sense
of their relative positioning
2020.98 within time, okay?
2022.38 So we have retrospective,
2023.8 current time interval measurements,
2025.33 and then prospective time
measurement into the future.
2030.2 The beauty of time perception
in the human nervous system
2034.71 is that it boils down to a
couple of simple molecules
2039.18 that govern whether or not
we are fine-slicing time
2043.2 or whether or not we are
batching time in larger bins.
2047.37 Those molecules go by names
that maybe you've heard,
2049.99 things like dopamine and norepinephrine,
2052.117 neuromodulators, called neuromodulators
2054.3 because they modulate, they change the way
2055.873 that other neural circuits work.
2058.63 Also things like serotonin.
2061.26 Serotonin is released
from a different site
2063.26 in the brain than
dopamine or epinephrin is
2065.92 and has a different
effect on time perception.
2069.11 So just to give you an example
of how things like dopamine
2072.16 and serotonin can modulate
our perception of time,
2076.37 want to focus on a
little bit of literature
2078.96 that now has been done
fortunately in animals and humans
2081.98 and which essentially shows
that the more dopamine
2086.23 that's released into our brain,
2089.47 the more we tend to
overestimate the amount of time
2092.6 that has just passed.
2094.21 Let me repeat that.
2095.09 The more dopamine that is
released into our brain,
2098.47 the more we tend to overestimate
how much time has passed.
2102.05 These experiments are very
straight, straightforward,
2104.18 excuse me, and they're very
objective, which is really nice,
2107.02 which is you can give
people or an animal a drug
2110.58 that increases the amount of dopamine
2112.82 and then ask them to measure off
2115.27 without any measurement
device like a watch or a clock
2118.46 when one minute has passed.
2120.9 As dopamine levels rise in the brain,
2123.56 people tend to think that the
minute is up before a minute.
2128.79 So they, at the 38-second
mark, they'll say,
2131.23 okay, I think a minute is up.
2132.19 So they've overestimated how
much time has passed, okay?
2136.0 The higher the level of dopamine,
2137.6 the more people tend to overestimate.
2139.72 Now, it's also true that norepinephrine,
2143.18 also called noradrenaline, plays a role
2145.44 and its role is very
similar to that of dopamine
2148.01 and that's because norepinephrine
2149.35 and dopamine are close cousins,
2151.07 as some of you may recall
2152.87 that they are actually manufactured
from one another, okay?
2156.45 So dopamine can actually make epinephrin
2159.58 and norepinephrine biochemically.
2162.15 There's a cascade in
which dopamine can be made
2164.77 into norepinephrine and
epinephrin, which is remarkable.
2168.0 How does having elevated
levels of dopamine
2170.04 and norepinephrine cause
one to overestimate
2172.74 how much time has passed?
2174.58 Well, it does it because of the way
2176.85 that it causes fine-slicing
of your time bins.
2181.4 So fine-slicing of time bins
2183.44 is like increasing the frame
rate on your camera, right?
2187.25 Slow motion is achieved in movies
2191.3 and elsewhere by
increasing the frame rate.
2194.44 So if you take a movie at 30
frames per second and watch it,
2199.23 it will appear to have
a certain speed, right?
2201.19 'Cause those are just
snapshots, 30 frames per second.
2204.74 In contrast, if you took that same movie
2207.25 at 4,000 frames per second,
you are fine-slicing
2210.55 and you're going to
see every little detail
2211.84 and as you play each one of those frames,
2213.81 it's going to look like
it moved slower, okay?
2217.01 Whatever, so the kind of
jump shot in basketball
2219.59 that's done slowly, any slow motion
2222.1 is the consequence of higher frame rate.
2224.84 So dopamine and norepinephrine
increase frame rate,
2229.38 and as a consequence, they tend to lead us
2232.47 to overestimate the amount
of time that's passed.
2236.64 Conversely, the neuromodulator
serotonin causes people
2241.14 to underestimate the amount
of time that's passed.
2244.6 So they've done these experiments.
2246.27 They actually have done
these experiments using,
2248.65 in humans, with drugs
that increase serotonin.
2250.87 They've also done them with cannabis
2252.66 which increases serotonin
among other things
2254.84 including the cannabinoid
receptor activation.
2259.0 And when people have
elevated levels of 5-HT
2263.26 or whether or not they've
ingested cannabis,
2265.01 they tend to underestimate
how much time has passed.
2267.57 You do the equivalent experiment.
2268.7 You tell people that they have to guess
2271.1 or tell you when five minutes,
for instance, has passed.
2274.41 Just use five minutes
as an example this time.
2276.54 And generally they will
miss the five-minute mark.
2279.51 They will think, they'll
let six minutes pass
2281.93 and they'll think it was five minutes
2283.42 when they've underestimated
how much time has passed.
2286.19 And that's because serotonin
2288.86 and some of the related
molecules in the brain
2291.25 tend to lead to slower frame rates, right?
2295.36 They take the frame rate in
the example I used before
2297.92 from 4,000 frames per second down
2299.62 to, say, 20 frames per second.
2302.34 So this is very interesting.
2305.31 It's interesting in terms of
how pharmacology can be used
2308.43 to adjust time perception
but it's also interesting
2311.21 in the context of that circadian rhythm.
2314.29 There's some emerging evidence
2315.91 that throughout the 24-hour cycle,
2318.41 there are robust changes
in the amount of dopamine,
2321.03 norepinephrine, and
serotonin that are present
2323.72 in the brain and bloodstream and body
2325.72 depending on time of day
within the circadian cycle.
2330.72 Now, I'm not talking about during sleep.
2333.74 During sleep, there are
definitely variations
2335.67 in things like dopamine,
norepinephrine, and serotonin.
2337.75 I talked about that in
the episodes on sleep.
2340.09 Here I'm just talking about
the role of these molecules
2343.41 in time perception during wakefulness.
2345.95 So much of the evidence points to the fact
2349.14 that in the first half of the day,
2351.06 approximate first half of the day,
2352.98 dopamine and norepinephrine
are elevated in the brain,
2355.63 body, and bloodstream much
more than is serotonin
2359.94 and that in the second half of the day
2361.47 and in particular towards
evening and nighttime,
2363.13 serotonin levels are going up.
2365.54 I think that's fairly
well-established now.
2367.84 What that means based on
what we just discussed
2370.47 about the role of dopamine,
norepinephrine, and serotonin
2372.81 in setting the frame
rate of time perception
2376.3 is that our perception
of the passage of time
2378.98 will be very different in
the early part of the day
2381.39 and in the latter half of the day.
2383.4 And there's starting to be some evidence
2385.01 to support this, that early in the day,
2388.02 people tend to overestimate
how much time has passed
2391.11 and later in the day,
2391.943 they tend to underestimate
how much time has passed.
2394.04 And this is independent of
taking any kind of substance
2396.24 that would increase or
decrease dopamine or serotonin.
2399.25 Now, this is important in terms
2401.32 of how one thinks about
structuring their day,
2403.19 because I know many people are thinking
2404.52 about the various tasks
that they need to do
2407.05 throughout their day.
2408.8 Many, or I should say
all of the literature,
2412.01 at least that I can find on productivity
2414.67 and things of that sort point to the idea
2416.87 that we should be doing the hardest task,
2418.9 the thing that we want to do the least
2420.5 or the most important
task early in the day
2423.49 as a kind of a psychological
tool for getting it done
2426.83 and feeling as if we
accomplished something
2428.72 and I think that's an
excellent protocol, frankly,
2431.8 but I'm not sure it's
an excellent protocol
2433.57 because of the way that
we sense accomplishment
2437.38 or at least it's not only
an excellent protocol
2439.81 because of the way that
we sense accomplishment.
2442.07 Another reason to move
something that's very hard
2444.93 into the early part of the day
2446.93 is that if indeed the dopaminergic
2450.247 and noradrenergic circuits
are more active at that time,
2454.62 we are actually in a
better position cognitively
2457.93 to parse that hard
problem because of the way
2460.67 that we are able to fine-slice
our perception of time
2464.76 and fine-slice all the
perceptual events outside us.
2467.89 So what I'm really saying
is that early in the day,
2470.01 you are a much more
high resolution camera,
2473.1 so to speak, than you
are later in the day.
2475.7 Now, different types of tasks
and different types of things
2478.88 require different frame rates
2481.04 or different ways of perceiving time,
2483.15 and indeed, this also
lends itself to a tool
2486.01 whereby for activities that involve
2489.51 more kind of creative thinking
that aren't as constrained
2492.96 by particular answers or outcomes
2495.5 and in which we need to kind
of blend different aspects
2499.16 of our memory, different
aspects of task utilization,
2503.75 in other words, for creative
works, for brainstorming,
2507.04 for things that are a bit
more fluid, so to speak,
2509.94 the more serotonergic
second half of the day,
2513.45 and because of the way the
serotonergic second half
2515.78 of the day lends itself
to our time perception,
2518.47 may actually be more beneficial
for those sorts of tasks.
2521.55 And I'll put a reference
to a couple of the studies
2523.75 that point to this idea
2525.29 that in these higher dopaminergic states,
2528.38 we are better at doing
certain sorts of tasks
2531.63 and in these more serotonergic states,
2533.57 we're better at doing other sorts of tasks
2535.84 and how the dopamine tends
to be earlier in the day
2538.96 and the serotonin later
in the day, so to speak.
2541.24 These are broad, I'm painting
with broad strokes here,
2543.84 but I think these lend themselves
2545.29 to some really excellent tools
2546.77 because I think we all
understand the value
2549.07 of doing something that's hard
2550.31 or challenging early in the day,
2551.79 but we should ask ourselves
hard or challenging how?
2554.62 What does that task
actually really require
2557.0 in terms of time perception?
2558.65 Some people might appreciate some examples
2560.27 of how this might work.
2561.4 Basically what I'm saying
is if you are doing work
2563.81 that involves adhering
to some rigid rules,
2567.04 so math or a recipe or
execution of musical scales
2571.82 or physical skills or accounting
2575.45 or something that requires
a lot of precision
2577.6 where there's a right and
wrong answer and it's hard,
2581.0 I would suggest that you do that
2582.14 in the early part of the
day because of the way
2584.17 that dopamine and norepinephrine
impact time perception.
2588.43 You are literally better
at slicing up time,
2591.71 you are a higher resolution
brain during those times,
2594.827 and so that's going to lend
itself better to events
2598.84 and demands that require high resolution,
2600.79 whereas in the afternoon
2602.65 in this more what I'm
calling serotonergic state,
2605.22 that's when you're going to
be better at brainstorming
2607.4 and creative works where
there's some flexibility
2610.17 in terms of how you're batching
time and perceiving time
2613.26 and there isn't so much rigid oversight
2616.25 of a right or wrong answer.
2617.94 And as an aside to support what I said
2620.31 but also to take us back
2622.12 to this critical role
of the circadian rhythm,
2625.1 there is a lot of evidence
2626.89 that when one's sleep is disrupted,
2629.28 when sleep is either too
short or is fragmented
2632.05 or is not of high enough
quality for enough days,
2635.33 one of the first things to happen
2637.41 is that there is a dysregulation
2639.72 of these dopaminergic, noradrenergic,
2642.28 and serotonergic states
throughout the day.
2644.05 They get kind of mish-mashed up.
2647.79 It's not that they're a total mess
2649.5 but they aren't as cleanly defined.
2652.33 And I think this is one of the reasons why
2654.02 when we haven't slept well
or we haven't slept enough,
2657.12 we tend to feel a little off,
like we can't concentrate.
2659.73 Part of that lack of concentration
is due to other things
2662.37 but part of that concentration
could be due to the fact
2664.29 that our sense of the
passage of time is disrupted.
2667.23 So there seems to be some value in keeping
2669.47 the dopaminergic noradrenergic
state kind of limited
2673.01 to the early part of the day
2674.26 and this serotonergic
state, as we're calling it,
2676.143 kind of pushed towards the
second half of the day.
2678.88 Now, there is a version of how
dopamine and norepinephrine
2681.86 can impact our perception
of the passage of time
2684.49 in ways that can be very
disruptive or even maladaptive
2689.02 and the best example that
I'm aware of is trauma.
2693.01 Many people who have been in car accidents
2695.68 or who have experienced some
other form of major trauma
2700.11 do what's called overclocking.
2702.692 Overclocking is when levels
of dopamine and norepinephrine
2707.5 increase so much during
a particular event,
2711.5 our level of alertness
is increased so much
2713.93 during a given event that we fine-slice.
2718.12 In other words, the frame
rate is increased so much so
2721.89 that we perceive things as
happening in ultra slow motion.
2726.01 Now, that might not seem
like a bad thing overall
2730.15 but the problem with
overclocking is the way
2733.83 in which that information
gets stamped down
2736.01 into the memory system.
2737.7 So the memory system, which
involves areas of the brain
2740.79 like the hippocampus
but also the neocortex,
2743.58 is basically a space-time recorder.
2746.46 What do I mean by space-time recorder?
2748.16 Well, your nervous system, of course,
2750.45 is housed in the darkness of your skull.
2753.01 It doesn't have a whole lot of information
2754.49 about the outside world
except light coming in
2756.35 through the eyes and whatever
happens to hit our ears
2758.608 in terms of sound waves
and skin and so forth
2762.32 so it has to take all those neural signals
2764.26 and it has to create a
record of what happened.
2767.44 Now, it doesn't create a record
of everything that happened
2769.67 but car accidents and trauma
2771.99 and things of that sort
oftentimes are stamped down
2774.51 into our record of what happened.
2777.33 And what gets stamped down,
2779.75 what we actually mean by
the phrase stamped down
2782.28 is that the precise firing
of the sequence of neurons
2785.8 that reflected some events,
2788.06 so let's say I'm in a car accident,
2789.94 certain neurons are firing
because of the flipping
2792.29 of the car or their
screams or there's blood,
2795.36 or, you know, things of that sort,
2797.42 all of that neural activity gets repeated
2802.27 in the hippocampus and then the sequence
2805.58 of the firing of those
neurons is also remembered.
2807.91 So it's not just that
neuron one, two, three, four
2810.81 fired in that sequence.
2811.93 It's also that neuron
one, two, three, four
2813.97 fired at a particular rate.
2815.46 So it would be one, two, three, four
2816.75 during the actual event and
then the memory is stored
2819.55 as firing of those neurons as
one, two, three, four, right?
2822.41 If during the event, it
was one, two, three, four
2825.07 at that rate, the storage of the memory
2827.86 is not going to be one,
2830.76 two, three, four, okay?
2832.53 In other words, there's both
a space code, as we say,
2835.7 meaning the particular neurons
that fire is important,
2838.67 and there's a rate code, how
quickly those neurons fire
2842.24 or the relative firing,
the timing of the firing
2844.92 of those neurons is
also part of the memory.
2846.91 This affords our memory
system tremendous flexibility.
2849.33 What it means is that you can
take the same set of neurons
2851.8 in the hippocampus and stamp
down many, many more memories
2855.61 because all you have to do is use a match
2859.276 of the different rates
of the different neurons
2861.85 that were firing in order
to set that code, right?
2864.593 Otherwise, if you needed
a different set of neurons
2866.9 for every memory, you'd need
an enormous hippocampus.
2869.04 You'd need an enormous head.
2870.21 So I think you get the basic idea.
2872.511 Overclocking is a case in
which the frame rate is so high
2876.98 that a memory gets stamped down
2879.18 and people have a very hard
time shaking that memory
2881.367 and the emotions associated
with that memory.
2883.91 And it's not the topic
of today's conversation
2886.09 but we will cover trauma in
a future episode in detail,
2889.12 but many of the treatments for trauma,
2892.31 EMDR, nowadays there's
a lot of excitement also
2894.87 about ketamine therapies,
exposure therapies,
2898.67 you know, like cognitive
behavioral therapies
2900.79 involve not just trying to
reduce the amount of emotion
2903.93 associated with a memory, but
also a deliberate speeding up
2908.36 or slowing down of that memory.
2910.4 In other words, trying to allow the person
2912.91 who experienced the trauma to take control
2914.81 of the rate of the
experience in their memory,
2918.24 not just whether or not
the memory happened at all.
2921.09 In fact, you know, one of the first things
2923.41 that trauma victims learn
2924.69 is that they aren't going
to forget what happened.
2927.37 What's eventually going to happen ideally
2929.5 with good treatment is
that the emotional weight
2932.67 of the experience will
eventually be divorced
2936.08 from the memory of the experience.
2938.02 And that's done again by trying to reduce
2940.4 the amount of emotional activation
2942.27 during the recall of that experience
2943.93 and one of the best ways to do that
2945.64 is to alter the rate
of the memory playback.
2950.06 In other words, taking
that firing of neurons
2952.06 that might've been one, two, three, four,
2954.29 again, it would be much more complicated,
2955.92 but one, two, three,
four for the car crash
2957.75 and getting the memory
to play back at a rate
2960.4 of one, two, three, four,
2963.17 or even one, two, three, four,
2965.83 one, two, three, four.
2967.4 In other words, allowing the person
2969.95 or instructing the person to take control
2972.68 of the rate of the
playback, and in that way,
2974.89 there seems to be still
yet unknown mechanism
2977.61 by which people can uncouple
some of the emotional weight
2981.73 that's associated with that memory.
2983.52 So overclocking is a
kind of extreme example
2988.44 of where the dopaminergic
and the neurogenetic system
2991.15 is ramped up so high
that people have this,
2994.32 unfortunately, what
seems like indelible mark
2996.7 in their brain of a particular event.
2998.43 But again, trauma treatment is designed
3000.03 to uncouple the emotional
load of that event.
3002.59 Some of you are probably saying
why dopamine during trauma?
3005.93 I thought dopamine was
the feel-good molecule.
3008.34 Well, in reality,
3010.5 dopamine is not necessarily
a molecule of reward.
3013.17 It's a molecule of motivation,
pursuit, and drive.
3016.11 And because of the close relationship
3017.83 between dopamine and norepinephrine,
3019.58 oftentimes they are co-released.
3021.59 So whether or not dopamine is
released during car crashes
3025.05 or other forms of trauma, we don't know
3027.18 but what we do know is that
both the dopamine system
3029.447 and noradrenergic system,
when we say noradrenergic,
3032.25 we mean norepinephrine, those
systems are greatly increased
3035.24 anytime there's a
heightened state of arousal.
3037.64 And arousal can have negative valence,
3039.93 like meaning associated with
an event that we really hate,
3043.2 that we would prefer
not to be involved in,
3045.11 or can positive valence, but
dopamine and norepinephrine
3048.69 are kind of the common hallmark
3050.73 of all things of elevated arousal.
3053.46 And so that's why we see
evidence for dopamine
3056.44 being associated with these
changes in time perception
3059.24 both for positive events
and for negative events.
3063.06 There's a very interesting
relationship between arousal,
3066.65 dopamine, time perception, and blinking,
3069.98 and this is all supported by
a really interesting paper,
3073.41 first author, Terhune is the
last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E.
3076.78 It's published in "Current Biology."
3078.41 Cell Press journal. Excellent journal.
3080.29 The title of the paper is
3081.123 "Time Dilates After Spontaneous Blinking."
3084.13 So heightened states of
arousal are associated
3085.94 with heightened levels of dopamine.
3087.25 You now know that dopamine leads
3089.22 to a kind of fine-slicing of time
3092.46 and one of the ways that we
fine-slice time is by blinking.
3096.28 You know, we think of
blinking as just a thing
3097.81 to lubricate our eyes or to limit
3099.76 the amount of light coming into our eyes,
3101.49 but it's a shutter on our experience.
3104.07 So much of the information
coming into the brain
3106.47 through our eyes impacts our attention.
3108.02 I've said it before on this podcast,
3109.54 that cognitive attention
follows visual attention,
3111.8 at least for sighted individuals.
3113.73 Well, it turns out that dopamine
3116.61 and increases in dopamine are associated
3118.71 with increases in spontaneous blink rate.
3121.35 So the more aroused we
are, the more awake we are,
3125.05 there are a number of effects.
3125.883 Pupils dilate, heart rate
increases, et cetera,
3128.1 but also blink rate increases.
3130.02 And every time we blink,
this study cleanly shows,
3134.37 we shift our perception
of time, leading to,
3137.03 as I mentioned before,
overestimations of time.
3140.32 So it seems as though in some way,
3142.55 blink rate is actually
related to frame rate.
3145.44 So this is very, very interesting
3147.7 and the way that you could
think about leveraging this
3150.19 would be if you wanted
to actually slow down
3154.0 your perception of time,
you would blink less.
3156.91 And if you want to speed
up your perception of time,
3159.5 you would blink more.
3160.45 Now, you'd have to think of a scenario
3162.22 in which that would be useful to you.
3163.9 Obviously if you're going to blink,
3165.13 you're going to miss things as well.
3166.95 But I think it's a very
interesting parameter
3169.8 of our visual attention as it
relates to time perception,
3173.18 because what it really speaks to
3174.75 is that these
neuromodulators like dopamine
3176.72 or serotonin that adjust frame rate,
3178.83 they're not doing it through
some magical mechanism.
3181.34 In fact, there's no single brain area
3183.53 that we can say controls time perception.
3186.18 I haven't said today, oh,
you know, it's the striatum.
3188.92 Well, it involves the striatum
but I'm not going to say,
3191.72 for instance, oh, it's the cerebellum.
3193.37 The cerebellum is definitely involved
3194.99 in timing of movement,
something for a future podcast,
3198.65 but time perception is what we call
3200.9 a distributed phenomenon.
3202.4 It's a network of areas in
the brain working together.
3205.45 But dopamine and the way that it relates
3208.12 to the shuttering of your eyes
3210.98 seems to be controlling the
frame rate on your experience.
3214.41 Numerous times on this podcast,
3215.84 I've talked about cold exposure
3217.52 and nowadays there's a lot of interest
3219.27 in things like cold showers, ice baths,
3222.43 immersion in cold water tanks
3225.18 and lakes and oceans
and things of that sort.
3227.92 There are a lot of
different positive effects
3229.81 of cold exposure provided
it's done properly.
3232.55 It can lead to increases in
metabolism, brown fat stores,
3235.19 which are the good fat
stores that you want.
3236.84 They're sort of like a furnace
3238.53 that allow you to heat yourself up,
3239.74 stay warm in cold environments,
to reduce inflammation,
3243.78 to increase resilience and so forth.
3246.97 There's a study published
3247.88 in the "European Journal of Physiology"
3249.34 showing that cold exposure can increase
3252.43 our baseline levels of
dopamine robustly, 2.5x,
3255.837 and it's a long-lasting
increase in dopamine
3258.1 and appears to be a healthy one,
3259.34 meaning it doesn't seem to be addictive.
3260.98 I'm sure there are some
people out there addicted
3262.57 to ice baths, but, you know,
when you think about the range
3264.97 of dopamine-inducing
behaviors that are addictive,
3267.45 it seems to be more on
the health-promoting side.
3270.78 What's interesting is that
because cold water exposure
3273.67 increases dopamine, it will also change
3275.94 your perception of time
and if you've ever done
3277.62 one of these cold water exposures,
you've experienced this.
3279.997 You've experienced getting
in and feeling like, wow,
3283.4 making it three minutes is
a really, really long time,
3285.93 and you are fine-slicing time.
3287.62 Your frame rate is going up.
3289.05 Part of that, just at a
kind of a coarse level
3292.44 is you're thinking, this is painful.
3293.75 I don't like this. I
want to get out, right?
3296.45 But part of it is also
that your dopamine levels
3298.93 are going up very quickly
and therefore your perception
3302.32 of that discomfort is
also being fine-sliced.
3305.21 And so you could leverage
a tool, for instance,
3307.85 where you try and entrain your thinking
3310.08 to something other than your
immediate experience, right?
3313.02 This is a kind of a
controversy, if you will,
3315.8 in the cold exposure world.
3318.45 The question is do you try
and lean into the experience
3321.39 and really feel it, or do you
try and distract yourself,
3324.64 you know, sing a song or count off,
3326.55 you know, from one to a hundred.
3330.56 Just know that whatever tactic you use
3332.69 to get through the cold exposure
3334.97 that the dopamine level
that's now increased
3337.77 in your system is going
to cause you to fine-slice
3341.32 or experience that at slow motion.
3344.1 So a minute is going to
seem like a lot longer
3346.36 than a minute in reality.
3349.01 So you could, for instance,
3351.42 decide to pay attention
to some external cue.
3355.1 Maybe it's a metronome that
ticks once every 10 seconds.
3359.56 You could decide to think
about something else.
3362.36 You could decide to
sing a song in your head
3364.36 or sing a song out loud.
3365.81 All of that will divorce
you from the sensation
3368.38 that you experience somewhat,
3369.56 but more so it will divorce you
3371.88 from the perception of
your experience as governed
3375.45 by that dopamine increase in frame rate.
3377.69 If that isn't clear, just know this.
3379.84 When you're in the ice bath,
your dopamine levels are high.
3381.98 When your dopamine levels are high,
3383.72 your experience of the discomfort
3385.09 of that ice bath is at higher resolution.
3388.26 Now, up until now, I've been
talking about how dopamine,
3391.22 and to some extent, serotonin
3393.78 can differentially impact
your perception of how fast
3397.34 or how slowly things are
happening in the moment.
3401.33 But remember, we have prospective time,
3403.86 we have our experience
of time in the moment,
3406.15 and we have retrospective time
3408.41 and there are beautiful
studies that have showed
3411.21 that the dopaminergic
state changes the way
3416.09 not just that we experience things now,
3418.42 but that it changes the way
in which we remember things
3422.39 in the past and the rate at
which those things occurred.
3425.6 And those are in opposite direction.
3428.13 So to make this very simple,
3430.74 if something that you
experience is fun or varied,
3435.56 meaning it has a lot of
different components in it
3438.64 and is, in other words, is associated
3440.7 with an increase in
dopamine in your brain,
3444.24 you will experience that
as going by very fast.
3449.36 Now, this is different than the ice bath
3450.81 which I just said you experienced
as going by very slowly,
3453.03 but here I'm talking
about something that's fun
3454.97 and varied that you really like
3456.7 and you feel like it
goes by very, very fast.
3458.83 Imagine an amazing day for
a kid at an amusement park.
3462.33 They can do a ton of things. It's all new.
3464.32 They're very excited and they'll feel
3466.21 like it goes by very fast,
3468.41 but later they will
remember that experience
3472.28 as being very long,
3474.61 that it was a long day
full of many, many events.
3477.59 And so there's this
paradoxical relationship
3480.38 between how we perceive
fun, exciting, varied events
3483.47 in the present and how we
remember them in the past.
3486.25 For those of you who've gone on vacation,
3488.37 if you've had an amazing day
on vacation, it'll seem like,
3490.87 or an amazing vacation overall,
3492.31 it will seem like it goes by very fast.
3494.23 The last day of vacation,
you sort of go, whoa,
3495.85 it went by so fast 'cause
there's so much happening.
3498.72 But in memory six to eight
months later, you remember, wow,
3502.84 that just went, you know,
that was a long, long thing.
3506.98 We had this. Then we had that.
3508.35 Then we did this. Then we had that.
3509.61 It tends to spool out in a longer memory
3512.74 than the actual experience.
3514.77 Conversely, if you are
bored with something
3519.03 or it's something you really don't like,
3520.32 it's going to seem like
it takes a long time
3523.72 to go through that
experience in the moment,
3526.21 but retroactively, looking back,
3528.09 it will seem like that
moment was very short.
3530.3 So the other day I was
waiting in the waiting room
3532.98 for the dentist, it was pretty boring.
3534.83 I was just kind of sitting there.
3535.98 There wasn't much going on.
3537.78 And it did seem like it was
going on an awfully long time,
3540.09 but indeed, looking back,
it just seems like, okay,
3542.05 I sat in that room, not much happened.
3544.03 And so it seems like
a very short time bin.
3545.67 This seems to be an efficiency
3547.42 of how the brain stores information,
3550.62 dopamine being associated, of course,
3552.36 with fun and varied experiences
3554.41 and low dopamine being associated
3556.23 with kind of empty, boring,
3558.51 or what at the time seem
like long experiences.
3562.06 And this whole thing has been stamped down
3564.47 into the scientific literature
by those earlier experiments
3567.65 where they take human
beings and isolate them
3569.51 in certain environments.
3570.67 You know, take away all their
clocks and watches and cues
3573.41 and about what time of day it is
3575.46 and what time of night it is
and allow people to have a life
3579.01 where they can either read
and work and do things
3582.22 or where they have very little to do.
3584.16 When people are isolated
in very boring environments
3587.57 and they don't have access
to time cues, time dilates.
3591.45 They tend to assume that time
has gone on very, very long.
3595.91 And so the reason I bring this
up is we aren't just driven
3599.24 by these circadian clocks
and these circannual clocks
3601.72 and these ultradian clocks.
3603.74 We are driven by these timers that vary
3607.7 depending on our level of excitement
3610.69 and they vary depending
on our level of excitement
3613.52 because of these neuromodulators,
dopamine and serotonin.
3616.13 So the way I like to think about it
3617.66 is that you have two
clocks, two stopwatches.
3620.78 One is a dopaminergic stopwatch
3623.24 that fine-slices really closely.
3625.24 It's like, counts off milliseconds
and it's grabbing a movie
3628.03 of your experience at
very high resolution.
3630.27 And in the other hand,
you have a stopwatch
3633.28 that's gathering big time bins,
3634.9 big ticks along the, you know,
3637.47 the hand is moving at bigger intervals,
3639.86 you know, marking off time.
3641.48 And depending on whether
or not you're excited
3644.58 or whether or not you're bored,
3645.73 you're using different stopwatches on time
3648.79 and therefore you're perceiving
your experience differently.
3652.03 One very interesting aspect to the way
3654.04 that neuromodulators like
dopamine and novelty interact
3658.75 with time perception and memory
3660.78 is how we perceive our
relationship to places and people.
3666.77 So really interesting literature showing
3668.76 that the more novel
experiences we have in a place,
3672.88 the more we feel we know
that place, obviously,
3676.59 but the longer we feel we've been there.
3679.46 So here's the kind of
gedanken or thought experiment
3681.88 that illustrates what's in the literature.
3684.32 Let's say I were to move to New York City.
3685.94 I happen to really like New York City.
3687.23 I've never lived there, but
let's say I lived there.
3689.59 I lived in a given apartment for a year
3692.36 and I would have a number
of different experiences
3694.42 in this mental experiment.
3695.71 Let's say I had 100 different
exciting and new experiences.
3702.01 I would at the end of that
year feel as if I lived there
3705.49 a certain period of time, one year.
3706.94 I would actually know
I lived there one year.
3708.59 If however I lived in
three different places
3710.58 in New York City and I met
three times as many people
3713.3 and I had three times as
many novel experiences,
3716.29 I would actually feel as if
I had been there much longer
3719.84 than had I only lived in one location.
3722.01 This is also true for social interactions.
3724.62 When we move to multiple
3727.49 or several novel environments
with somebody else,
3731.2 we tend to feel as if we
know that person much better
3733.52 and that they know us much better.
3734.91 Now, of course, we get the
opportunity to interact
3736.79 with those people in different contexts
3738.23 and so indeed we do get the
opportunity to see them,
3741.19 for instance, at the coffee
shop, how they order coffee.
3744.14 You maybe go to a sports
event, how they act there.
3747.36 Maybe how they interact with your family.
3749.15 You're getting a sense of
them in different contexts.
3752.07 That's certainly playing a role,
3754.72 but it seems as if the
more novelty you experience
3757.8 with somebody, not only the
more familiar they are to you,
3761.08 but the more time you feel
you've spent with them,
3763.45 even though the total amount of time
3765.05 can be exactly the same.
3766.56 And so that's a very interesting aspect
3768.65 of how our perception of time
and these neuromodulators
3771.21 and novelty can shape the
way not just that we perceive
3775.08 a given event in our
world, but how we relate
3777.93 to a place or relate to a person.
3779.97 So we've talked a lot about
the different neurochemicals
3782.89 and how those neurochemicals can influence
3784.77 our perception of time.
3786.06 We haven't talked a lot
about the neural circuits
3788.15 and the various areas of the
brain that underlie this.
3791.26 I do want to touch on that
3792.36 by highlighting a really wonderful study.
3795.35 This was a study published in "Neuron,"
3796.99 also a Cell Press journal,
excellent journal.
3799.47 The title of the paper is
"Behavioral, Physiological,
3802.43 and Neural Signatures of Surprise
3804.8 During Naturalistic Sports Viewing."
3808.06 This experiment is really cool.
3809.12 They did brain imaging on individuals
3811.32 who are watching basketball games.
3813.84 These were basketball games
3815.2 that actually took
place that were recorded
3817.83 and the subjects watching
these basketball games
3821.47 in some cases, not all, had some interest
3823.87 in who would win or lose,
and in some cases, not all,
3826.81 the subjects in these studies
had some prior knowledge
3829.78 of which team they thought was better,
3831.81 which team was likely to
win or not likely to win.
3835.71 The basic findings of the study
3837.03 were that they could measure surprise
3841.53 by the release of dopamine
in two areas of the brain,
3845.43 part of what are called,
is called, excuse me,
3847.47 the mesolimbic reward pathway.
3849.33 So the two areas of the
brain that are important here
3850.9 are the nucleus accumbens and the VTA,
3853.38 the ventral tegmental area.
3854.62 These are areas that release dopamine
3857.52 as kind of a token of reward
3859.36 any time something is surprising
3861.66 or a positive expectation is met, okay?
3865.27 So if I predict that my
team dribbling down court
3868.65 is going to score on this drive
3870.45 and they get the ball in the basket,
3871.98 a little bit of dopamine is released.
3873.3 These two brain areas light up
3875.24 in the functional imaging so-called FSRI,
3878.382 functional magnetic resonance imaging
3880.3 that they used in this study.
3883.2 What's really interesting about this study
3884.88 is not just that dopamine
was released any time
3888.64 that something the subject
wanted to see happened, right,
3892.12 any time they wanted to see
their team score, they scored,
3894.8 but also during surprise.
3896.67 So if they thought for instance,
3898.79 and they would hit a button to predict
3901.1 that their team was going to
score in this particular drive
3903.41 and they didn't, well, then
dopamine could also be released
3907.17 in response to that surprise.
3909.06 So this speaks again to
dopamine being something
3911.33 that's important not
just for positive events,
3914.1 but for unexpected events.
3916.11 Now, that's all very interesting
and speaks to the fact
3919.12 that dopamine is a kind of
flexible currency in the brain.
3922.46 It's doled out, if you will, or released
3925.57 when something that one
hopes will happen happens
3929.09 and it's released when there's a surprise,
3931.9 even if it's a kind of
a negative surprise.
3934.01 It's not something that the
subject wanted to happen.
3937.26 But the more interesting thing
3939.09 is how that relates to time perception.
3942.25 What they found was
regardless of what caused
3945.06 the dopamine release, the
frequency of dopamine release
3949.37 predicted how the subjects
parsed the time bins
3953.48 of the game they were watching.
3955.72 What do I mean by that?
3956.7 Well, when you watch a basketball game
3958.37 or you watch anything,
children playing or talking
3961.05 to your spouse or whatever,
you're batching time.
3964.78 How are you batching time?
3966.55 Well, you could batch a
meal by the, I don't know,
3969.62 the appetizer, the main
course, and the dessert,
3972.24 but it turns out that's
not what you're doing.
3974.68 You're batching time according
3976.89 to the frequency of dopamine pulses,
3979.48 the frequency of dopamine release.
3981.25 And that's what they saw in this study.
3983.06 If they evaluated people's perceptions
3985.28 of the passage of time,
3986.55 what they found is that that matched
3988.31 not whether or not the, you know,
3990.29 it was a particular
time point in the game,
3992.59 not whether or not their
team was going down court
3994.94 or running back up court to play defense,
3997.73 but the dopamine released
served as markers
4002.36 which would predict the frame rate
4004.27 of their perception of the experience.
4006.0 And if that sounds complicated,
what I mean is how often
4009.1 and when you release
dopamine is actually setting
4012.34 the frame rate on the entire
perception of everything,
4015.84 not just for positive
events or negative events.
4018.79 So what this means is as
you're going through life,
4022.83 dopamine and the release of
dopamine is saying that's over
4027.98 and now you're in a new phase of your life
4030.14 even if it's very short, right?
4031.62 So if I get up in the morning
4033.127 and I really need a cup of
coffee, as you probably all know,
4036.03 I wait 90 minutes to 120 minutes
before I drink my coffee,
4040.03 but then I get my coffee
4040.98 and surely there's a dopamine
hit there, I promise you,
4043.97 I actually am starting to carve up my day
4047.96 according to dopamine hits.
4050.83 Consciously or subconsciously,
4054.5 I'm actually carving up my experience
4057.04 according to when I'm getting
dopamine throughout my day.
4059.87 This governance over
our perception of time
4063.47 that dopamine has points to a very clear,
4067.08 very actionable, and very powerful tool.
4070.55 And that is a tool that many
people have talked about before
4073.35 which are habits.
4075.97 People have discussed habits
in a variety of contexts
4078.73 but in the context of dopamine reward
4083.67 and time perception, what this means
4086.56 is that placing specific habitual routines
4090.85 at particular intervals
throughout your day
4094.54 is a very, not just convenient,
4096.94 but a very good way to
incorporate the dopamine system
4101.0 so that you divide your day into a series
4103.35 of what I would call functional units.
4105.15 What would this look like?
4106.22 It would mean waking up and
having one specific habit
4108.56 that you always engage in that
causes a release of dopamine.
4114.15 You can say, well, great.
4115.69 That'll make me feel
good. And I would agree.
4118.32 Dopamine released generally
makes us feel motivated
4121.32 But it would have an
additional effect of marking
4123.67 that time of day as the beginning
of a particular time bin.
4127.98 Then inserting another habit,
perhaps the beginning of,
4130.99 I don't know, your breakfast or something,
4133.06 but recognizing that that's a habit
4134.81 and being fairly habitual, you
don't have to be, you know,
4137.82 obsessively precise about the timing,
4140.1 but that regular sequencing of things
4144.5 is going to lead not
just to dopamine release
4147.09 as it relates to reward and
motivation and feeling good,
4150.01 but it actually becomes the way
4151.62 in which we carve up our
entire experience of our day.
4155.32 And this is almost a circular argument.
4157.93 You could say, well, of course, you know,
4159.12 I do one thing, then I do the next,
4160.58 then I do the next, and
that's how I perceive my day.
4163.69 That's my day. It's my list.
4165.33 It's my to-do list, et cetera.
4167.24 But what I'm saying is that
on the basis of this study,
4170.04 I should mention the first
author, his last name is Antony.
4173.15 It was Antony et al. It
was published in 2020.
4177.11 The study on basketball
viewing, what it points to
4179.95 is that by engaging in specific habits
4182.83 that we know we can perform well,
4185.07 we are actually setting
the frame rate on our day.
4188.37 And so I think there will soon come a time
4190.59 where human beings are not
just thinking of, okay,
4192.94 my morning routine and
my afternoon routine,
4195.65 I think that can be useful, and in fact,
4197.73 I used or mentioned a structure
4199.7 of that sort earlier in the episode,
4201.56 but rather thinking about
what's actually going on
4204.95 at the level of our biology,
4207.26 which is that dopamine is marking time.
4209.91 Habits are a very clear way
4211.78 in which we can invoke dopamine release
4214.24 and therefore provide time
markers, and what this means
4217.47 is that, for instance,
during your morning,
4219.6 you might insert habit one and habit two
4222.33 at, say, I don't know, 8 AM and 10 AM,
4225.2 and in doing that, that marks an epoch,
4227.83 a little batch of time
in your morning routine
4231.64 that's distinct from the
second half of your morning.
4234.54 In other words, habits serve as flankers
4237.55 or markers for the passage of your day.
4240.91 Now, if that seems kind of hyper-neurotic
4242.77 or why would I want to
structure my life like that,
4245.04 I would say that many people would do well
4247.59 to structure their life like
that and to utilize habits
4250.44 not just for the sake of
what you do during the habit,
4252.84 but because of the fact that
the habits serve as a marker
4256.14 because of the way they
can evoke dopamine release.
4258.98 And in doing that, you are
able to segment your day
4262.55 into a bunch of smaller, if
you want them to be smaller,
4265.33 or larger functional units.
4268.81 If anyone wants to experiment with this,
4270.89 the Huberman Lab Podcast
puts out a newsletter.
4272.9 It's called the Neural Network Newsletter.
4274.42 You can sign up for it at hubermanlab.com.
4277.49 We put it out each month.
4278.49 You can see the previous newsletters.
4280.06 There's zero cost. We have
our privacy statement there.
4282.4 We don't share your email or anything.
4284.12 And there you'll find the, you know,
4287.3 12 steps to improving
sleep was the first one.
4290.05 There's another, the second newsletter
4291.71 was all about neuroplasticity
4293.09 and using scientific literature
4294.88 to improve learning and teaching,
and in the next newsletter
4299.05 I intend to include an example protocol
4301.78 of how one could use
habits and the relationship
4304.03 between habits and dopamine,
dopamine and time perception,
4307.65 to structure your day
according to performance
4310.23 of particular types of tasks.
4312.11 Today we covered a lot
about time perception.
4314.24 We certainly didn't cover
everything about time perception
4316.38 but we covered things like entrainment,
4317.97 the role of dopamine,
habits and various routines
4321.21 that can adjust your sense of time
4323.44 for sake of particular goals.
4325.44 If you're interested in learning
more about time perception,
4328.48 I'd like to point you to
a really excellent book
4330.93 called "Your Brain Is a Time Machine:
4332.807 "The Neuroscience and Physics of Time."
4335.3 The book was written by
Professor Dr. Dean Buonomano
4338.13 who's a professor at
UCLA and a world expert
4340.88 in the neuroscience and physics of time.
4343.48 I do hope to get Dean on the podcast
4345.63 in the not too distant future.

4390.12 Not so much today but on
many previous episodes
4392.37 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
we discuss supplements,
4395.05 and while supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
4397.96 many people derive great
benefit from supplements
4400.25 for sleep, for focus, and so forth.
4402.88 One issue with supplements,
however, is that what's listed
4405.78 on the bottle of various supplements
4407.16 isn't always what's included in the bottle
4409.16 and the quality of ingredients
varies tremendously
4411.75 across different supplement manufacturers.
4414.03 For that reason, we've
partnered with Thorne,
4416.27 that's T-H-O-R-N-E,
4417.93 because Thorne supplements
have the highest levels
4420.08 of stringency of any
supplement company out there
4422.27 that we are aware of.
4423.41 They work with all the major sports teams.
4425.54 They work with the Mayo Clinic.
4426.66 And so we're delighted that
we partnered with them.
4428.4 If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,
4430.3 you can go to Thorne,
that's T-H-O-R-N-E, .com
4433.73 slash the letter U slash Huberman
4435.82 to see the supplements that I take
4437.18 and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements.
4439.92 If you enter the Thorne
site through that portal,
4442.27 you can also get 20% off
any of the supplements
4444.96 that Thorne makes.
4446.2 Thank you for your time
and attention today,
4448.2 and last but certainly not least,
4450.41 thank you for your interest in science.
