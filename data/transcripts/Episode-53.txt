- Welcome to
0.983 the Huberman Lab Podcast
1.92 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.93 for everyday life.
9.13 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.09 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
12.64 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.56 Today, we are going to
discuss the gut and the brain,
17.89 and we are going to discuss how your gut
20.08 influences your brain and your
brain influences your gut.
24.2 As many of you probably know,
25.9 there is a phenomenon
called your gut feeling,
28.69 which tends to be something
that you seem to know
31.49 without really knowing how you know it.
33.96 That's one version of the gut feeling.
35.95 The other is that you sense
something in your actual gut,
39.85 in your body, and that somehow drives you
43.7 to think or feel or act
in a particular way,
46.55 maybe to move towards something
48.16 or to move away from something.
50.32 Now, today, we aren't
going to focus so much
52.23 on the psychology of gut feelings
54.9 but on the biology of gut feelings
57.33 and how the gut and brain interact.
59.14 Because indeed your gut is
communicating to your brain
61.63 both directly by way of
neurons, nerve cells,
65.13 and indirectly by changing
the chemistry of your body,
68.38 which permeates up to your brain
70.02 and impacts various
aspects of brain function.
72.98 But it works in the other direction, too.
74.86 Your brain is influencing your entire gut.
78.04 And when I say entire gut, I
don't just mean your stomach,
80.34 I mean, your entire digestive tract.
82.47 Your brain is impacting things
83.78 like how quickly your food is digesting,
86.32 the chemistry of your gut,
88.06 if you happen to be
stressed or not stressed.
90.41 Whether or not you are under
a particular social challenge
93.68 or whether or not you're
particularly happy
95.31 will in fact adjust the
chemistry of your gut
98.07 and the chemistry of your gut in turn
100.33 will change the way that your brain works.
102.78 I'll put all that together for you
104.27 in the context of what we
call the gut microbiome.
107.23 The gut microbiome are the
trillions of little bacteria
110.87 that live all the way
along your digestive tract
114.1 and that strongly impact the
way that your entire body works
117.84 at the level of metabolism,
119.17 immune system, and brain function.
121.76 And of course, we will discuss to tools,
123.73 things that you can do
in order to maintain
126.45 or improve your gut health.
128.49 Because as you'll also soon see,
130.7 gut health is immensely important
133.11 for all aspects of our wellbeing
135.61 at the level of our brain,
136.94 at the level of our body,
138.55 And there are simple, actionable
things that we can all do
141.27 in order to optimize our gut health
143.78 in ways that optimize
144.97 our overall nervous system functioning.
146.98 So we will be sure to review those today.
149.83 This episode also serves
as a bit of a primer
152.37 for our guest episode
that's coming up next week
155.02 with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg
from Stanford University.
158.34 Dr. Sonnenburg is a world
expert in the gut microbiome
162.46 and so we will dive really
deep into the gut microbiome
165.84 in all its complexity.
167.53 We'll make it all very simple for you.
169.02 We will also talk about
actionable tools in that episode.
171.78 This episode is a standalone episode,
173.78 so you'll get a lot of
information and tools,
175.86 but if you have the opportunity
to see this episode first,
178.37 I think it will serve as a nice
primer for the conversation
181.44 with Dr. Sonnenburg.
182.89 Before we begin,
183.8 I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
185.48 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
188.25 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
190.3 to bring zero cost to consumer information
192.2 about science and science-related tools
194.36 to the general public.
195.78 In keeping with that theme,
196.88 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
199.77 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
202.0 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
203.61 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
206.08 I've been using Athletic Greens,
207.52 which is now called AG1, since 2012
210.86 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
213.5 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens
215.3 and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens
216.86 once or twice a day
218.13 is that it covers
218.963 all of my foundational
vitamin and mineral needs
221.3 and also because it contains
223.33 high quality probiotics and prebiotics,
226.0 which is a topic that we're
going to talk a lot about today.
228.72 With Athletic Greens, I can
be sure that I'm getting
230.9 all the vitamins and minerals that I need.
232.93 So if I'm missing anything in my diet,
235.03 I can compensate for that
with the Athletic Greens.
237.55 Plus it has the probiotics and prebiotics
240.36 that can also compensate
for any deficiencies
242.55 that I might have in creating
the right environment
245.5 for my gut microbiome.
247.08 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
248.44 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
251.38 to claim a special offer.
252.73 They'll give you five free travel packs,
254.27 which make it very easy
to mix up Athletic Greens
256.75 while you're in the car or on a plane
258.23 or otherwise on the move,
259.32 and they'll give year's
supply of vitamin D3 K2.
262.73 While not everyone needs
additional vitamin D3,
265.26 many people do even if they're
getting sufficient sunlight.
268.23 So you get the year's
supply of vitamin D3,
269.88 and it also has K2 in there.
271.1 K2 has been shown to be important
273.13 for various aspects of calcium regulation,
275.3 cardiovascular health, and so on.
277.06 Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
279.74 to claim this special offer.
281.24 Today's episode is also
brought to us by LMNT.
284.25 LMNT is an electrolyte drink
that contains no sugar.
287.23 It does however contain sodium,
magnesium, and potassium.
291.23 I've talked about sodium
on the podcast before.
294.05 I think sodium can indeed be
problematic for some people
297.78 with hypertension or pre-hypertension,
299.95 but for many people,
sodium is a great thing.
303.05 It can increase blood volume
304.19 in ways that can be helpful to them.
305.74 It can improve nerve cell function in ways
307.96 that can be helpful to them,
309.18 and for me, anytime I'm
exercising and sweating a lot,
312.62 I want to replace my electrolytes
314.03 and that means replacing sodium
315.51 for adequate neuron function,
muscle function, and so on.
319.023 LMNT is formulated to help anyone
320.75 with their electrolyte needs
322.09 and is perfectly suited for people
323.63 who are following a
ketogenic, low carbohydrate,
326.23 or paleo diet.
327.88 LMNT contains a science-backed
electrolyte ratio
330.36 of 1000 milligrams of sodium,
332.7 200 milligrams of potassium,
334.17 and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
336.47 If you'd like to try LMNT,
337.417 you can go to drinklmnt.com/huberman
340.72 to claim a free LMNT sample pack.
342.66 You only pay the cost of shipping.
344.32 Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman
347.32 to claim a free sample pack.
349.0 Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
351.62 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
354.34 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
356.95 to help you better understand your body
358.55 and help you reach your health goals.
360.58 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
363.51 for the simple reason that
many of the things that impact
366.16 your immediate and long-term
health can only be assessed
368.96 with a quality blood test.
370.33 And nowadays with the
advent of modern DNA tests,
373.2 you can also get insights
into, for instance,
375.46 what your biological age
is and how that compares
378.41 to your chronological age.
380.25 Now, one of the major problems
with a lot of blood tests
382.61 and DNA tests out there is
that you get numbers back,
385.32 they'll tell you if those
numbers are in range
386.85 and out of range
387.84 but they don't tell you
anything about what to do
389.36 with that information.
390.673 With InsideTracker, they
make everything very simple
393.33 in terms of directing you
towards particular protocols.
395.82 So these could be nutrition protocols,
397.77 supplementation protocols, or
lifestyle behavioral protocols
401.29 to help you bring those numbers
402.76 into the ranges that are best for you.
405.28 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
406.69 you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

InsideTracker's plans.
412.11 That's insidetracker.com/huberman

416.01 Okay, let's talk about
the gut and the brain
418.4 and how your gut and your brain
419.77 communicate in both directions.
422.16 Because as I mentioned before,
423.64 your gut is communicating all the time
426.23 with your brain and your brain
is communicating all the time
429.49 with your gut.
430.4 And so the two are in this
ongoing dance with one another,
434.08 that ordinarily is below
your conscious detection
437.23 although you're probably
familiar with the experience
439.37 of every once in a while
getting a stomach ache
441.74 or of eating something that
doesn't agree with you,
443.8 or conversely eating something
445.47 that you find particularly delicious
447.87 and that sensation or
that experience rather
450.83 being a whole body experience.
452.8 Your mind is excited about
what you're eating or just ate,
455.77 your gut is excited about what
you're eating or just ate,
459.2 and it seems to be a kind
of unified perception
462.07 of both brain and body.
464.13 Today, we're going to talk
about how that comes about
466.31 in the negative sense.
467.69 Like, you know, when you meet
someone you really dislike
470.55 or when you have a stomach ache,
471.44 and in the positive sense,
472.91 when you interact with somebody
473.85 that you really, really like
474.98 and you'd like to spend more
time with them, for instance,
477.18 or when you eat something
478.47 that you really, really like
479.93 and you'd like to spend
more time with that food,
481.85 so to speak.
483.1 Now, the gut and the brain
represent what we call
486.15 a biological circuit,
488.23 meaning they include different stations.
490.91 So station A communicates with station B,
493.64 which communicates with
station C, and so on.
496.22 And as I mentioned earlier,
it is bidirectional.
497.92 It's a two-way street
between gut and brain.
501.29 I want to make the important
point at the outset
504.04 that when I say the word gut,
505.97 when I refer to the gut,
507.45 I am not just referring to the stomach.
510.52 Most of us think that the
gut equates to the stomach
513.76 because we think of having
a gut or not having a gut
517.0 or having a gut feeling of some sort.
519.79 But in the context of gut-brain signaling
523.25 and the related microbiome,
525.81 the gut includes the
entire digestive tract.
529.54 That's right, from start to finish
531.3 the entire digestive tract
533.08 so much so that today
we're going to talk about,
535.77 for instance, the presence
of neurons, nerve cells,
538.84 that reside in your gut
540.45 that communicate to specific
locations in the brain
543.67 and cause the release of
specific neurochemicals,
546.25 such as the neurochemical
dopamine or serotonin,
549.52 that can motivate you to seek
more of a particular food
552.81 or type of interaction or behavior,
555.01 or to avoid particular foods,
interactions, and behaviors.
558.56 And some of those neurons,
many of those neurons, in fact,
561.62 reside in your intestines,
not in your stomach.
564.71 They can be in the small
intestine or the large intestine.
567.58 In fact, you actually have
taste receptors and neurons
571.16 located all along your digestive tract.
573.82 You have neurons that are located
575.26 all along your digestive tract
576.81 and they are communicating to your brain
579.45 to impact what you think, what
you feel, and what you do.
582.83 Okay, so for the gut-brain axis,
584.34 we need to deal with the brain part
585.94 and then we need to
deal with the gut part.
588.08 Let's just quickly talk
about the brain part
589.87 because there the word brain
is also a bit of a misnomer
593.61 in that when we say the gut-brain axis,
595.94 it does include the brain
597.22 but includes a lot of
other things as well.
600.31 So as many of you probably know by now,
602.7 if you're listeners of this podcast,
604.16 and if you don't, that's fine,
606.08 your nervous system includes your brain
609.14 and your spinal cord
610.39 and those together constitute
611.69 what's called the central nervous system.
614.28 Your neural retinas,
615.64 which are lining the back of your eyes
618.49 and are the light sensing
portion of your eyes
622.39 are also part of your
central nervous system.
625.72 So actually your eyes
are part of your brain.
627.323 They're the only parts of your brain
628.97 that are outside the cranial vault.
631.01 So your retinas, your brain proper,
634.08 and your spinal cord make up
the central nervous system.
636.62 The other parts of your
nervous system constitute
638.44 what's called the
peripheral nervous system,
640.99 which are the components
of your nervous system
642.69 that reside outside the
retinas, brain, and spinal cord.
646.65 Now, this is very important
647.76 because today we're going to talk a lot
649.38 about how the gut
communicates with the brain.
652.14 And it does that by way
653.73 of peripheral nervous system components,
657.02 meaning nerve cells that reside in the gut
659.5 and elsewhere in the body
that communicate to the brain
663.26 and cross into the central nervous system
665.96 to influence what you think
and what you feel, okay?
668.81 So that's the nervous
system part of what we call
671.32 the gut-brain axis,
673.4 brain, again, just being a shorthand
674.87 for including all the
elements I just described.
677.85 Gut, as you now know,
679.07 includes all the elements
of the digestive tract.
681.56 Let's talk about the
architecture or the structure
684.85 of the gut of your digestive system.
687.56 Now, not surprisingly
your digestive system,
690.44 aka your gut, begins at your
mouth and ends at your anus.
694.15 And all along its length,
695.78 there are a series of sphincters
698.0 that cut off certain chambers
of the digestive tract
701.34 from the other chambers.
703.5 Now, also along this tube that
we call the digestive tract,
707.95 there's great variation
in the degree of acidity,
711.23 or pH as it's sometimes called.
714.29 That variation in acidity
turns out to give rise
718.0 to different little microenvironments
720.6 in which particular
microbiota, microbacteria,
724.32 can thrive or fail to thrive.
727.66 And so the way I'd like you to think
729.01 about the digestive tract,
730.33 this gut component of the gut-brain axis,
733.42 is that it's not just one component.
735.66 It's not just your stomach
with a particular acidity
738.47 and a bunch of microorganisms
740.36 that work particularly well
742.44 to make you feel good
743.59 and make your digestive
pathways work well.
747.11 It's a series of chambers,
little microenvironments,
750.38 in which particular microbiota thrive
753.32 and other microbiota do not.
755.82 And certain behaviors that you undertake
758.64 and certain experiences that you have
760.65 will adjust those
microenvironments in ways
763.63 that make particular
microbiota, certain bacteria,
766.64 more likely to thrive and
others less likely to thrive.
770.05 We'll talk about how that was
set up for you early in life.
773.23 Actually from the moment
that you came into the world,
775.37 that microbiome was being established.
777.73 It was actually strongly impacted
780.72 depending on whether or not
you were born by C-section
782.88 or by vaginal birth.
785.0 And it was strongly
impacted by who handled you
787.95 when you came into the world,
788.9 literally the hands that were on you.
790.83 How much skin contact you had,
792.6 whether or not you were
a preemie baby or not,
794.89 whether or not you had pets at home,
796.21 whether or not you were
allowed to play in the dirt,
797.86 whether or not you were
allowed to eat snails
799.28 or whether or not you were kept
800.51 in a very antiseptic environment.
802.42 All of those experiences
803.81 shaped these little microenvironments
806.22 and shaped what constitutes best or worst
809.03 for those microenvironments, okay?
810.91 So you have this long tube that
we call the digestive tract
814.28 and it's very, very long.
816.4 In fact, if we were to splay it out,
818.63 we were to take all the curves and turns
820.88 out of the intestine, we would
find that it is very long.
823.94 It's approximately nine meters long.
826.94 Now, the structure of that digestive tract
828.71 turns out to be very important
830.3 in terms of gut-brain signaling.
833.61 Once again, it's a tube
and the hollow of that tube
836.11 is called the lumen, L-U-M-E-N.
839.22 But the walls of the tube
are not necessarily smooth,
842.47 at least not for significant portions
844.48 of the digestive tract.
846.14 For much of the digestive tract,
849.04 there are bumps and
grooves that look very much
851.83 like the folds in the brain,
853.15 but these bumps and grooves
are made up of other tissues.
856.01 They're made up of what's
called a mucosal lining,
857.98 so there's a lot of mucus there.
860.12 And if we were to look really closely,
862.4 what we'd find is that there are
863.6 little hairy-like cellular processes
867.17 that we call microvilli
869.07 that are able to push things
along the digestive tract.
874.31 The microbiota reside
everywhere along the lumen
878.15 of the digestive tract,
880.35 starting at the mouth and
all the way to the other end.
883.04 And they reside within those microvilli
885.87 and they reside within the lumen.
888.13 And if we were to look really closely
891.14 at the bumps and grooves
along the digestive tract,
894.33 what we would find is that
there are little niches,
897.0 little areas in which particular things
899.91 can grow and reside best.
902.44 Now, that might sound kind of gross,
903.68 but it actually is a good thing,
905.37 especially what's growing
and residing there
908.08 are microbacterial organisms
that are good for your gut
912.53 and that signal good things to your brain.
914.3 And we will talk about what
that signaling looks like
916.44 and how that's done and
accomplished in just a few moments.
919.25 But I want you to get a clear
mental picture of your gut,
922.32 something that we don't often see.
923.99 And often when we think about the gut,
925.58 again, we just think about
the hollow of the stomach,
927.81 food going in there, and getting digested,
929.82 but it's far more complex
931.15 and actually far more
interesting than that.
933.17 Now, I've been referring
to the gut microbiome
935.38 and to the microbiota and these bacteria.
938.32 Let me define those terms a
little bit more specifically
940.82 just to avoid any confusion.
943.97 The microbiota are the actual bacteria.
946.94 The microbiome is used
to refer to the bacteria
950.17 but also all the genes as bacteria make,
952.83 because it turns out that
they make some important genes
954.71 that actually impact all of us.
958.46 You have loads and loads
960.24 of these little
microbiota, these bacteria.
963.41 In fact, right now you
are carrying with you
966.06 about two to three kilograms,
968.22 so that's more than six pounds,
970.34 of these microbiota, these bacteria.
973.1 And if we were to look at
them under a microscope,
974.9 what we would see
975.733 is these are relatively
simple little organisms.
978.51 Some remain stationary
so they might plop down
981.47 into the mucosal lining
982.94 or they might hang out on
a particular microvilli
985.45 or they might be in one
of those little niches,
988.17 and others can move about,
990.15 but they basically fill the entire lumen.
993.01 They surround and kind of coat the surface
996.04 of the microvilli and they're tucked up
998.57 into any of those little niches
that are available to them
1002.21 to tuck into.
1004.3 If you were to take the head of a pin
1006.85 and look at it under the microscope,
1009.21 you could fit many, many hundreds,
1010.95 if not thousands or more of
these little microbacteria.
1015.51 And the reason I say many,
many thousands or more,
1018.45 I'm giving a kind of broad range there,
1020.29 is that they do vary in size
1022.13 and, again, they vary as to
whether or not they can move
1023.87 or they don't move.
1025.62 Now, they're constantly
turning over in your gut,
1028.07 meaning they're being born so to speak
1030.52 and they're dying off.
1032.67 And some will stay there
1034.41 for very long periods
of time within your gut
1036.33 and others will get excreted.
1038.13 About 60% of your stool,
1040.95 as unpleasant as that
might be to think about,
1043.52 is made up of live and dead microbacteria.
1047.73 So you're constantly making
1049.22 and excreting these microbacteria.
1052.25 And which microbacteria you make
1055.34 and how many stay inside
your gut and how many leave,
1059.7 meaning how many are excreted,
1062.23 depends a lot on the chemistry of your gut
1065.33 and depends very strongly
on the foods that you eat
1068.76 and the foods that you do not eat.
1070.94 Now, just because what we
eat strongly influences
1073.48 our microbiome, meaning our microbacteria,
1076.97 does not mean that there
are not other influences
1080.51 on what constitutes our microbiome.
1083.93 Our microbiome is also
made up by microbacteria
1087.48 that access our digestive
tract through our mouth,
1090.02 through breathing, through kissing,
1093.83 and through skin contact.
1096.12 In fact, one of the major
determinants of our microbiome
1099.7 is who we interact with
1101.67 and the environment
that we happen to be in.
1104.06 And that actually includes whether or not
1105.57 we interact with animals.
1107.85 In a little bit, I'll talk about some data
1110.2 as to whether or not you grew
up in a home that had animals,
1113.35 whether or not you grew up in the home,
1114.52 whether or not there was
a lot of social contact,
1116.41 meaning skin contact,
1118.07 or whether or not you grew up
1119.42 in a more animal sparse,
contact sparse environment
1123.61 and how that shapes your microbiome.
1125.81 But the simple point is that what you eat
1128.37 influences your microbiome,
but also what you do,
1131.1 what you think, and what you feel,
1132.4 and many of the low microbacteria
1135.14 that get into your digestive tract
1137.44 do so by way of social interactions.
1139.96 In fact, if you ask a neurobiologist
1142.55 what the role of the microbiome is,
1144.66 they'll tell you almost certainly
1146.99 that it's there to impact brain function.
1150.26 But if you have friends
that are microbiologists,
1154.46 such as I do, they'll tell you,
1157.66 well, maybe the brain and
nervous system are there
1159.76 to support the microbiome.
1161.04 It's the other way around.
1162.6 You have all these little microorganisms
1164.11 that are taking residence in our body.
1166.8 They don't really know what
they're doing as far as we know.
1169.48 We don't know that they have
consciousness or they don't.
1171.45 We can't rule that out, but
it seems pretty unlikely.
1173.84 Nonetheless, they are taking advantage
1176.36 of the different environments
1178.26 all along your digestive tract.
1179.8 They are taking advantage
1181.62 of the sorts of social interactions,
1183.83 for instance, the people you talk to
1184.957 and that breathe on you,
1186.26 the people that you shake hands with,
1188.01 the people that you kiss or don't kiss,
1190.14 the people that you happen to be
1191.15 romantically involved with or not,
1192.89 your dog, your cat, your lizard, your rat,
1194.93 whatever pet you happen to own
is impacting your microbiome.
1199.12 There's absolutely no question about that.
1201.1 So hopefully now you have
some sense of the architecture
1203.52 of the digestive pathway
1205.36 and you have some sense of the trillions
1208.26 of little microbacteria that are living
1210.49 all along the different components
1212.27 of that digestive pathway.
1214.35 But what we haven't talked about yet,
1215.95 and what I'd like to talk about now,
1217.63 is what those little
microbiota are actually doing
1221.28 in your digestive tract.
1223.15 In addition to just living there
1224.34 for their own intents and purposes,
1226.35 they are contributing, for
instance, to your digestion.
1229.51 Many of the genes that
those microbiota make
1232.86 are genes that are
involved in fermentation
1235.33 and genes that are involved in digestion
1237.6 of particular types of nutrients.
1240.05 And in a little bit, we will talk
1241.68 about how what you eat can
actually change the enzymes
1246.16 that those microbiome components make,
1249.15 enzymes largely being things
1250.76 that are responsible for digestion.
1252.75 They catalyze other
sorts of cellular events
1254.83 but in the context of
the digestive pathway,
1256.91 we're talking about enzymes
that help digest your food.
1259.33 So those microbiota are indeed
helping you in many ways.
1262.8 And if you lack certain microbiota
1264.46 that can help you digest,
1266.14 it stands to reason that
you would have challenges
1267.93 digesting certain types of foods.
1269.98 The other amazing thing
that these microbiota do
1273.54 is they change the way
that your brain functions
1276.73 by way of metabolizing or facilitating
1280.05 the metabolism of particular
neurotransmitters.
1283.23 So one of the ways that having
certain microbiota present
1285.9 in your gut can improve your
mood or degrade your mood,
1289.82 for instance, is by way
of certain microbiota
1294.56 being converted into or
facilitating the conversion
1298.17 of chemicals, such as GABA.
1301.02 GABA is what we call an
inhibitory neurotransmitter.
1304.55 It's involved in suppressing the action
1307.53 of other neurons.
1308.9 And that might sound like a bad thing,
1310.81 but all types of sedatives, for instance,
1314.11 alcohol, and a lot of neurons
that naturally make GABA
1317.89 can help quiet certain
circuits in the brain,
1319.78 for instance, circuits
responsible for anxiety.
1323.28 In people who have epilepsy,
1325.28 the GABAergic neurons, as they're called,
1327.81 can all often be disrupted
in their signaling,
1330.56 meaning they're not
cranking out as much GABA
1332.62 and therefore the excitatory neurons,
1335.17 which typically release other
molecules like glutamate
1337.92 can engage in what's
called runaway excitation
1340.98 and that can give rise to seizures.
1343.02 So the simple message here
is that the microbiota
1346.46 by way of making neurochemicals
1348.87 can influence the way
that your brain functions.
1351.35 So you want to support those microbiota
1353.04 and we will give you tools
to support those microbiota.
1356.83 But the takeaway at this point
1359.31 is that those microbiota
are making things locally
1361.99 to help digest food.
1363.47 Other microbiota are helping to make
1366.08 certain neurotransmitters like GABA,
1368.04 and we'll also talk about
dopamine and serotonin.
1370.59 And so the very specific
microbiota that reside in your gut
1374.86 have a profound influence
1376.29 on many, many biological functions,
1378.71 especially immune system function,
1381.1 brain function, and digestion.
1383.69 So that should give you
a fairly complete picture
1385.9 of your gut microbiome.
1388.3 Now I'd like to talk
about how your microbiome
1390.72 and your brain communicate,
1392.46 or more accurately, how your microbiome
1394.33 and the rest of your
nervous system communicate.
1396.92 Neurons, which simply means nerve cells,
1399.65 are the cells that do
most of the heavy lifting
1402.37 in your nervous system.
1403.32 There are of course other
cell types that are important.
1405.41 Glial cell, for instance, very,
very important cell types.
1408.38 You have endothelial cells,
1409.74 which are responsible for blood flow,
1411.47 pericytes and other types of cells,
1413.75 but the neurons are really
doing most of the heavy lifting
1416.68 for most of the things we think about
1418.44 in terms of nervous system function.
1421.41 You have neurons in your gut
1424.21 and that should not surprise you.
1427.15 Neurons reside in your brain,
your spinal cord, your eyes,
1429.94 in fact, all over your body,
1431.76 and you've got them on your
heart and in your heart,
1434.07 and you've got them in your lungs,
1436.36 and you've got them in your spleen,
1438.26 and they connect to all
the different organs
1440.66 and tissues of your body.
1442.82 So that's not surprising that
you have neurons in your gut.
1445.53 What is surprising, however,
1447.24 is the presence of
particular types of neurons
1449.97 that reside near or in the mucosal lining
1453.92 just next to that lumen of the gut
1456.78 and that are paying attention,
1458.91 and I'll explain what I
mean by paying attention,
1460.83 to the components of the
gut, both the nutrients
1464.095 and the microbiota,
1466.74 and thereby can send signals
1469.84 up to the brain by way of a long wire
1473.47 that we call an axon, and can communicate
1477.9 what the chemistry and what
the nutritional quality
1482.16 and what the other aspects of
the environment are at the gut
1484.94 at a given location up to the brain
1487.67 in ways that can influence
the brain to, for instance,
1489.95 seek out more of a particular food.
1492.64 Let me give you a sort of
action-based picture of this.
1495.5 Let's say like most people,
you enjoy sweet foods.
1499.26 I don't particularly enjoy sweet foods
1500.88 but there are a few that I like.
1501.95 I'm a sucker for a really
good dark chocolate
1505.5 or really good ice cream
1507.36 or I got this thing for donuts
1509.33 that seems to just not quit
1510.86 although I don't tend to
indulge it very often,
1513.36 I do like them.
1515.22 If I eat that particular food,
1517.01 obviously digestion starts in the mouth.
1519.47 There are enzymes there,
it gets chewed up,
1521.07 the food goes down into the gut.
1523.55 These neurons are activated,
1527.29 meaning that causes the neurons
to be electrically active
1530.83 when particular components,
1532.48 certain nutrients in
those foods are present.
1535.39 And for the cell types,
1537.3 or I should say the neuron
types that matter here,
1540.58 the nutrients that really
trigger their activation
1543.47 are sugar, fatty acids,
1546.06 and amino acids.
1548.42 Now, these particular neurons
1550.33 have the name enteroendocrine cells
1553.21 but more recently they've been
defined as neuropod cells.
1557.46 Neuropod cells were discovered
1558.63 by Diego Bohorquez's
lab at Duke University.
1562.28 This is a phenomenal set of discoveries
1563.89 made mostly in the last 10 years.
1566.37 These neuropod cells, as I mentioned,
1568.76 are activated by sugar,
fatty acids, or amino acids,
1572.57 but have a particularly
strong activation to sugars.
1577.43 They do seem to be part of
the sweet sensing system.
1580.43 And even though I'm focusing
on this particular example,
1582.97 they represent a really nice example
1585.72 of how a particular set
of neuro cells in our gut
1589.41 is collecting information
about what is there
1591.9 at a particular location in the gut,
1593.46 and sending that
information up to our brain.
1596.05 Now, they do that by
way of a nerve pathway
1599.26 called the vagus nerve.
1600.95 The vagus nerve is part of
the peripheral nervous system.
1603.24 And the vagus nerve is a
little bit complex to describe
1606.42 if you're just listening to this.
1608.27 If you are watching this,
1609.49 I'll try and use my hands as a diagram
1611.61 but really the best thing to do
1613.34 if you want really want
to learn neuroanatomy
1615.65 is to just imagine it in
your mind as best you can
1618.08 and if you can track down
a picture of it, terrific,
1619.89 but here's how it works.
1621.84 Neurons have a cell body
that we call a soma,
1624.13 that's where all the DNA are contained.
1627.45 That's where a lot of
the operating machinery
1629.77 of the cells are contained
1631.33 and a lot of the
instructions for that cell
1633.34 of what to be and how to
operate are contained.
1636.36 The cell bodies of these
neurons or the relevant neurons
1640.1 are actually up near the neck.
1642.09 So you can think of them
as a clump of grapes,
1645.33 'cause cell bodies tend
to be round or oval-ish.
1648.37 And then they send a
process that we call an axon
1652.84 in one direction out to the gut
1656.46 and they'll send another
process up into the brain.
1660.54 And that little cluster near the neck
1662.58 that's relevant here is called
1663.907 the nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E.
1667.38 The nodose ganglion is a
little cluster of neurons
1670.18 on either side of the neck.
1671.89 It has a process that goes out to the gut
1673.267 and a process that goes up into the brain.
1675.387 And again, these are just one component
1677.84 of the so-called vagus nerve.
1680.75 The vagus nerve has many, many branches,
1682.78 not just to the gut.
1683.85 There are also branches to the liver,
1686.42 branches to the lungs,
1687.47 branches to the heart,
branches to the larynx,
1690.47 and even to the spleen,
1691.99 and other areas of the
body that are important.
1694.9 But right now we're just
concentrating on the neurons
1696.74 that are in the gut that
signal up to the brain.
1699.24 And what the Bohorquez lab has shown
1702.59 is that these neuropod
cells are part of network.
1705.76 They're sensing several
different nutrients,
1708.32 but in particular, when they sense sugar,
1710.33 they send signals in the
form of electrical firing
1714.2 up to the brain in ways
that trigger activation
1717.13 of other brain stations that
cause you to seek out more
1720.94 of that particular food.
1723.18 Now, this brings us to
some classic experiments
1725.62 that at least to me are incredible.
1728.44 And these are highly reproducible findings
1730.77 showing, for instance,
1732.2 that even if you bypass taste
1734.94 by infusing sweet liquid
1737.96 or putting sweet foods into the gut,
1741.74 and people can never taste
them with their mouth,
1744.51 people will seek out more
of that particular food.
1747.81 And if you give them the option
1749.32 to have a sweet food
infused into their gut
1753.92 or a bitter food infused into their gut
1756.87 or a sweet versus sour,
1759.17 or a more sweet versus less sweet food,
1761.8 people have a selective
preference for sweet foods
1765.21 even if they can't taste them.
1767.33 Now, this is important to understand
1768.91 in the context of gut-brain signaling
1770.45 because we always think
that we like sweet foods
1773.08 because of the way they taste.
1774.8 And indeed that's still true,
1777.15 but much of what we consider
the great taste of a sweet food
1781.49 also has to do with a gut sensation
1783.77 that is below our conscious detection.
1786.38 How do we know that?
1787.52 Well, the Bohorquez lab
has performed experiments
1791.04 using modern methods and
they're classic experiments
1793.33 showing that animals and humans
1795.34 will actively seek out more
of a particular sweet food
1798.96 even if it bypasses this taste system.
1801.79 And the reverse is also true.
1804.06 There have been experiments
done in animals and in humans
1807.28 that have allowed animals or humans
1809.55 to select and eat sweet foods,
1811.78 and indeed that's what they do
if they're given the option.
1816.0 And yet to somehow eliminate
the activation of these neurons
1820.73 within the gut that can sense sweet foods.
1823.7 Now, there are a couple different ways
1824.75 that those experiments ave been done.
1826.24 In classic experiments
that date back to the '80s,
1829.47 this was done by what's called
subdiaphragmatic vagotomy.
1832.52 So this means cutting off
the branch of the vagus
1834.69 that enervates the gut below the diaphragm
1837.2 so that the other organs
can still function
1838.96 because the vagus is very important,
1840.65 but basically cutting off
the sweet sensing in the gut,
1843.46 still giving people the
opportunity to taste sweet foods
1845.75 with their mouth,
1846.583 and they don't actively seek out
1848.49 quite as much of the sweet food
1850.53 when they don't have this
gut sensing mechanism
1852.83 that we now know to be dependent
on these neuropod cells.
1857.06 More recent experiments
involve selective silencing
1859.6 of these neuropod cells.
1861.17 And there have been a lot
of different derivations
1862.95 of this sort of thing,
1863.94 but the takeaway from it
is that our experience of
1867.04 and our desire for particular foods
1869.07 has everything to do with
how those foods taste.
1871.5 It also has to do, as you probably know,
1873.84 with their texture and the
sensation of those foods
1877.67 in our mouth, and even indeed
how they go down our throat
1880.69 sometimes can be very
pleasing or very unpleasant.
1884.41 And it also has to do with
this subconscious processing
1888.22 of taste that occurs in the gut itself.
1891.92 And again, when I say gut, I
don't just mean in the stomach.
1894.12 There are actually
neurons, neuropod cells,
1897.31 further down your digestive tract
1899.07 which are signaling to your brain
1900.91 about the presence of sweet foods,
1902.44 as well as foods such
as amino acid rich foods
1906.11 or foods that are rich in
particular types of fatty acids
1909.43 signaling up to your brain
1911.74 and causing you to seek
out more of those foods
1914.85 or to consume more of those foods.
1917.2 Now, you're probably
asking, what is the signal?
1919.33 How does it actually make
me want more of those foods
1921.93 without me realizing it?
1923.33 Well, it does that by
adjusting the release
1925.39 of particular neuromodulators.
1927.84 For those of you that are not
familiar with neuromodulators,
1930.23 these are similar to neurotransmitters,
1931.79 but they tend to act more broadly.
1933.8 They tend to impact many
more neurons all at once
1936.27 and they go by names
like dopamine, serotonin,
1939.03 acetylcholine, epinephrine, and so forth.
1941.67 Sometimes people refer to
those as neurotransmitters.
1944.18 Technically they are neuromodulators.
1945.89 I'll refer to them almost
always as neuromodulators.
1948.87 The neuropod cells signal by way
1951.53 of a particular branch of the vagus
1953.92 through that nodose ganglion
that we talked about before
1956.99 and through a number of different stations
1959.77 in the brain stem,
1960.88 eventually cause the release
of the neuromodulator dopamine.
1966.02 Dopamine is often associated
1968.04 with a sense of pleasure and reward
1969.81 but it is more appropriately
thought of as a neuromodulator
1973.25 that impacts motivation,
craving, and pursuit.
1975.85 It tends to put us into modes of action,
1977.87 not necessarily running
and moving through space,
1980.62 although it can do that too,
but in the context of feeding,
1983.39 it tends to make us look around more,
1987.02 chew more, reach for things more,
1989.14 and seek out more of whatever it is
1990.75 that's giving us that sensation
1993.07 of delight or satisfaction.
1995.75 And again, that sense of
delight and satisfaction,
1998.64 you might experience only consciously
2001.0 as the way that something
tastes on your mouth
2003.31 but it actually is caused again
2005.24 by both the sensations in your mouth
2007.85 but also by the activation
of these neuropod cells.
2011.12 So this is an incredible
system of gut-brain signaling,
2014.15 and it is but one system
of gut-brain signaling.
2016.74 It turns out it's the system
that we know the most about
2019.78 at this point in time.
2021.17 There are other components
of gut-brain signaling
2023.19 that we'll talk about in
a moment, for instance,
2024.84 the serotonin system.
2026.9 But in terms of examples
of gut-brain signaling
2029.47 for which we know a lot
of the individual elements
2031.85 and how they work,
2032.87 I think this neuropod, neuron
sensing of sweet foods,
2037.33 fatty acids, and amino acids in the gut
2039.47 and communicating that up to the brain
2042.36 by way of the vagus and causing us
2044.11 to seek out more of the foods
2045.43 that deliver those nutrients
is an incredible pathway
2048.89 that really delineates
the beauty and the power
2051.38 of this gut-brain axis.
2053.29 Let me talk about timescales.
2054.57 Here I'm talking about a
particular type of neuron
2057.28 that is signaling up to the
brain using electrical signals
2060.94 to cause us to want to seek out
2063.08 a particular category of foods.
2066.8 That's happening relatively fast
2068.8 compared to the hormone
pathways of the gut
2071.11 which also involve neurons.
2072.64 So your gut is also
communicating to your brain
2075.13 by way of neurons, nerve cells.
2078.61 But some of those nerve
cells also release hormones.
2081.96 And those hormones go by names like CCK,
2084.33 glucagon-like peptide 1, PYY, et cetera.
2089.1 A good example of a hormone pathway,
2091.73 or what's sometimes called
a hormone peptide pathway,
2094.46 that is similar to the pathway
I've talked about before
2098.21 but a little bit slower
is the ghrelin pathway.
2101.77 Ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N,
2104.87 increases with fasting.
2107.66 So the longer it's been
since you've eaten,
2110.14 or if you're just eating very little food
2112.24 compared to your caloric needs,
2114.06 ghrelin levels are going to
go up in your bloodstream
2116.4 and they go up because of processes
2118.77 that include processes within the gut
2121.18 and include the nervous system.
2122.94 So it's a slow pathway driving you
2124.87 to seek out food generally.
2127.09 As far as we know, the
ghrelin system is not partial
2130.12 to seeking out of sweet foods
or fatty foods or so on.
2135.59 Ghrelin increases the longer it's been
2138.55 since you've eaten sufficient calories
2140.61 and it stimulates a feeling of
you wanting to seek out food.
2144.17 Well, how does it do that?
2146.03 It does that again by
impacting neural circuits
2148.32 within the brain, neural
circuits that include
2150.72 what we call the brain
stem autonomic center.
2152.85 So it tends to make you feel alert
2154.91 and quite, we say, high
levels of autonomic arousal.
2158.52 If you haven't eaten in a while,
2159.97 you might think that you just
get really exhausted, right?
2162.2 Because we all hear that food is energy
2163.9 and caloric energy is
what we need to burn,
2165.99 but you actually have a lot
of energy stored in your body
2168.4 that you would be able to use
2170.66 if you really needed energy.
2172.85 But typically if we
haven't eaten in a while,
2174.38 we start to get agitated
2175.88 and we get agitated by way way of release
2177.79 of the neuromodulator epinephrine,
2180.05 which causes us to look
around more, move around more,
2182.95 and seek out food.
2185.13 That all occurs in brain
stem autonomic centers
2187.54 and in the hypothalamus.
2188.58 We did an entire episode
on feeding behavior
2190.96 and metabolism as well
2192.67 and you can find those
episodes at hubermanlab.com
2194.79 so I don't want to go into a lot of detail
2196.47 about hypothalamic and
brains stem centers.
2198.71 But there's a particular area of the brain
2200.8 called the nucleus of the solitary tract,
2203.27 the NST as it's called,
that's very strongly impacted
2206.74 by these circulating hormones
2208.28 and tends to drive us
toward feeding behavior.
2210.73 So the important point here
is that we have a fast system
2213.96 that is paying attention
to the nutrients in our gut
2216.09 or the absence of nutrients in our gut,
2217.71 and stimulating us to seek out food
2219.6 or to stop eating certain foods,
2221.35 and we have a slower
hormone-related system
2224.71 that also originates in the
gut and impacts the brain.
2227.54 But all of those converge on
neural circuits for feeding.
2232.36 The neural circuits for feeding
2233.52 include things like the arcuate
nucleus of the hypothalamus,
2235.87 they include a bunch of
other neurochemicals,
2238.05 but the point is that
you've got a fast route
2240.44 and a slow route to drive
you to eat more or eat less,
2244.8 right, to seek out food and
consume it or to stop eating,
2248.79 to essentially kickstart
the satiety mechanisms
2252.49 as they're called,
2253.74 and those are operating in parallel.
2255.83 It's not like one happens first
2257.2 then stops then the other.
2258.07 They're always operating in parallel.
2259.67 And I bring this up because
there's a bigger theme here
2262.06 which we see over and
over again in biology,
2264.28 which is the concept of parallel pathways.
2266.17 You've always got multiple
accelerators and multiple brakes
2269.21 on a system.
2270.043 It's very, very rare to
have just one accelerator
2272.2 and one brake on the system.
2273.61 And this will become important later
2274.93 when we talk about tools for
optimizing your gut microbiome
2278.3 for healthy eating and for
health healthy digestion
2280.61 and for healthy brain function.
2282.07 I want to take a moment and talk
2283.21 about glucagon-like peptide 1,
2285.88 which is also called GLP-1.
2289.895 GLP-1 is made by neurons in the gut
2293.8 and by neurons in the brain.
2295.693 This is a fairly recent discovery
2298.73 but it's an important one.
2300.3 GLP-1 tends to inhibit feeding
2304.21 and tends to reduce appetite.
2307.63 There are a number of drugs
released on the market now,
2311.84 one for instance goes
by the name semaglutide,
2314.81 which is essentially an GLP-1 agonist.
2318.28 It causes the release of more GLP-1.
2320.42 It's being used to treat type II diabetes,
2322.6 which is insulin resistant diabetes.
2324.42 This is different than type I diabetes
2326.36 where people don't actually make insulin.
2328.79 It's also being used as
a drug to reduce obesity.
2334.02 And it seems pretty effective
2335.61 at least in certain populations.
2337.94 There are certain foods and
substances that increase GLP-1.
2341.22 I've talked about a few
of these on the podcast.
2343.32 One that I'm a particular fan
of for entirely other reasons
2346.04 is yerba mate tea can
stimulate the release of GLP-1.
2350.62 In South America, it's often used
2352.01 as an appetite suppressant,
2353.28 probably in large part
2354.41 because of its effect on GLP-1 release,
2357.84 but probably also because
it does contain caffeine,
2360.4 which is a bit of a stimulant,
2361.53 which also can be involved in lipolysis,
2363.32 which is the utilization of fat stores
2364.97 for energy and so forth.
2367.4 A brief mention about yerba mate.
2369.95 There are some reports
out there that yerba mate
2372.69 can increase certain types of cancers.
2375.28 The data that I've seen on this
2377.87 is that it tends to
relate to whether or not
2379.76 those are smoked versions
of the yerba mate tea,
2382.5 the amount of consumption,
2384.37 and the debate is still out.
2385.72 So I invite you to look at those papers.
2387.37 You can search for those online.
2390.81 Nonetheless, yerba mate is one
source of GLP-1 stimulation.
2395.2 Semaglutide is another source.
2396.75 It also can be stimulated
by various foods, nuts,
2399.12 avocados, eggs, and so forth.
2401.92 Certain high fiber complex grains
2404.3 will also stimulate GLP-1.
2406.74 I raise this as not necessarily a route
2409.94 that you want to take in
order to reduce food intake.
2412.71 I don't even know that that's your goal.
2414.56 But that GLP-1 is another one
2418.62 of these gut-to-brain signaling mechanisms
2420.69 that adjusts appetite
that is dependent on diet,
2424.55 depends on what you eat or drink,
2426.78 and that the GLP-1 pathway
2428.8 does seem particularly sensitive
2430.65 to the constituents of diet.
2432.68 There's at least one quality study
2434.45 I was able to find showing
2435.45 that the ketogenic diet for instance,
2437.51 which almost always involves ingestion
2440.4 of very low levels of carbohydrate
2442.27 can increase GLP-1.
2444.14 Although, as I mentioned before,
2445.26 there are other foods that fall
2446.49 outside the range of what
we would consider ketogenic
2449.37 that can also stimulate GLP-1,
2450.92 and as I mentioned,
2451.753 there are prescription
drugs, like semaglutide,
2454.01 there are other ones as well now,
2455.28 that stimulate GLP-1.
2457.51 So how does GLP-1 reduce appetite?
2459.5 It does that, in part, by
changing the activity of neurons
2462.81 in the hypothalamus,
2463.643 this cluster of neurons just
above the roof of our mouth,
2466.92 that themselves make GLP-1
2469.74 and that cause the
activation of motor circuits
2472.92 for reaching, chewing, all the things
2475.563 that we associate with feeding behavior.
2478.07 So I use GLP-1 as an example of a pathway
2480.39 that you might choose to tap into
2482.04 by ingestion of yerba mate
2483.5 or by ingestion of the foods I mentioned,
2485.23 or if it's something that
interests you, ketogenic diet.
2488.09 But I also mention it simply
2490.11 because it's another beautiful example
2492.66 of how a hormone pathway
can impact the activity
2495.45 of brain circuits that
are directly involved
2497.6 in a particular behavior.
2499.4 So yet another example of how
gut is communicating to brain
2503.58 in order to change what we think we want
2506.45 or to change what our
actual behaviors are.
2509.1 So the next time you find
yourself reaching for food,
2511.43 or you find yourself wanting
a particular sweet thing
2515.44 or fatty thing or something that contains
2518.15 a lot of amino acids,
2519.55 a protein rich food,
2521.67 keep in mind that that's not just
2523.23 about the taste of the food,
2524.62 and it's not even necessarily
about the nutrients
2526.69 that you need or don't need.
2528.41 It could be,
2529.243 but it's also about this
subconscious signaling
2531.5 that's coming from your body all the time,
2533.4 waves of hormones, waves
of nerve cell signals,
2537.53 electrical signals that
are changing the way
2539.67 that your brain works.
2541.47 And this raises for me
2543.17 a memory of the episode that I
did with Dr. Robert Sapolsky,
2547.84 who's a world expert
colleague of mine at Stanford,
2550.54 who is expert on things
like hormones and behavior.
2554.23 But we got into the topic of free will,
2556.37 which is a bit of a barbed wire topic
2558.53 as many of you know.
2559.363 It gets into the realm
of philosophy, et cetera.
2561.147 And we were kind of batting back and forth
2563.34 the idea, I was saying, "Well,
I think there's free will,
2566.95 and can't there certainly be free will
2568.78 or certainly the idea that we
can avoid certain choices?"
2573.02 And Robert was saying, "No."
2575.94 In fact, he said, "Nah,"
he doesn't believe
2578.76 that we have any free will.
2579.85 He thinks that events in
our brain are determined
2583.04 by biological events that are
below our conscious detection
2586.81 and that occur seconds to milliseconds
2589.08 before we make decisions or assessments
2591.28 and, therefore, we just
can't control what we do,
2594.54 what we think, and what we feel.
2596.37 And at the time I sort of didn't buy it.
2599.08 I thought, I don't know.
2600.51 I just, I guess I really
wanted to believe in free will.
2603.28 And to some extent I still do
2605.04 but as we talk about how
these neurons in our gut
2607.377 and these hormones in our
gut are influencing our brain
2610.65 and the decisions that we are making,
2612.34 at the level of circuits,
like the hypothalamus
2614.69 and the nucleus of the solitary tract,
2616.56 these are areas of the brain
way below our frontal cortex
2619.67 and our conscious perception.
2622.05 Think these are examples that really fall
2623.78 in favor of what Dr. Sapolsky was arguing,
2626.95 which is that events that
are happening within our body
2629.65 are actually changing
the way our brain works.
2631.2 So we might think that
we want the cupcake.
2633.26 We might think that we
don't need to eat something
2636.83 or do need to eat something
2638.17 and that is entirely on the
basis of prior knowledge
2641.7 and decision-making that
we're making with our head,
2644.05 but in fact,
2644.94 it's very clear to me based on the work
2647.07 from the Bohorquez lab,
2648.45 classic work over the years
dating back to the '80s,
2651.0 and indeed back to the '50s
2652.21 that we'll talk about in a moment,
2653.72 that our body is shaping the decisions
2656.43 that our brain is making and
we're not aware of it at all.
2659.63 Now, the good news is that
whether or not you believe
2661.9 in free will or not, the simple knowledge
2664.12 that this whole process is happening
2666.34 can perhaps be a benefit to you.
2667.93 You can perhaps leverage
it to get some insight
2671.11 and understanding and perhaps even a wedge
2672.84 into your own behavior.
2673.7 You might think, ah, I think
I want that particular food,
2677.18 or I think I want to avoid
that particular food,
2679.54 but actually that's not a decision
2681.95 that I'm making on a
purely rational basis.
2684.2 Has a lot to do with what
my gut is telling my brain.
2687.03 So we've largely been talking
about chemical communication
2690.16 between the gut and the brain.
2691.77 Chemical because even
though these neuropod cells
2695.63 are communicating with the brain
2697.04 by way of electrical activity,
2699.08 what we call action potentials,
2700.66 and in neural language
we call those spikes,
2703.4 spikes of action potentials,
2706.58 spikes of action potentials,
2709.4 meaning those neural signals,
2710.63 cause the release of chemicals
in the brain like dopamine.
2715.45 So it's chemical transmission.
2718.55 Similarly, hormones, even
though they act more slowly,
2721.41 hormones like neuropeptide
Y like CCK, like ghrelin,
2726.0 they are signaling chemically.
2728.07 They're moving through the body,
2730.14 they're going in there
affecting the chemical output
2732.99 of different cells,
2734.17 and they're changing the
chemistry of those cells
2735.937 and the chemistry of the cells
that those cells talk to.
2738.65 So that gives us one particular
category of signaling
2741.62 from gut to brain, which
is chemical signaling.
2744.94 But of course there are
other forms of signals
2747.56 and those fall under the
category of mechanical signaling.
2751.55 You're probably familiar with this.
2752.87 If you've ever eaten a very large meal
2754.84 or consumed a lot of fluid,
2756.74 you experience that as
distension of the gut
2759.25 and that doesn't just have to
be distension of the stomach,
2762.36 but distension of your intestines as well.
2766.1 That distension is registered by neurons
2768.29 that reside in your gut,
2769.91 the signals go up to your brain,
2771.25 and communicate with areas of the brain
2772.82 that are responsible for suppressing
2774.92 further consumption of food and/or fluid,
2777.74 and, under certain circumstances,
2780.2 can also be associated with the activation
2782.94 of neural circuits that cause vomiting
2784.82 or the desire to vomit.
2786.07 So if ever you've eaten too
much or you've eaten something
2788.87 that doesn't agree with you,
2790.29 that information is communicated
2792.54 by way of mechanosensors
2793.97 that sense the mechanics of your gut,
2796.21 possibly also the chemistry of your gut,
2797.91 but mostly the mechanics of your gut,
2800.01 signal up to the brain,
2801.52 and activate brain
centers that are involved
2803.63 in stopping the eating behavior,
2806.68 and activation of an
area of the brain stem
2810.49 that is affectionately referred to
2812.34 as the vomit center among neuroanatomists.
2815.09 This is a area that more appropriately
2817.83 is called the chemoreceptor
trigger zone, the CTZ,
2820.84 or area postrema
2822.07 and neurons in this area
actually will trigger
2824.84 the vomiting reflex.
2826.82 So the way that the gut
and the brain communicate
2830.13 is both chemical and mechanical,
2832.0 and it can be both for sake
2833.45 of increasing certain types of behavior.
2836.97 Today, we're talking mainly
about feeding behavior
2838.8 up until now anyway
2840.47 but also ceasing to
eat, closing your mouth,
2844.01 moving away from food,
turning away from food,
2846.86 all behaviors that we're familiar with
2848.31 anytime we feel kind of sick
2849.61 on the basis of activation
of this mechanosensor
2853.5 for gastric distress.
2855.54 So we've got chemical signaling
and mechanical signaling.
2858.39 And I also want to emphasize that we have
2860.49 direct and indirect signaling
from the gut to the brain.
2864.07 Direct signaling is the kind of signaling
2866.28 of the sort I've been talking
about mainly up until now,
2868.76 which is neurons in the gut
2871.4 communicating with
neurons in the brain stem
2873.19 that communicate with
neurons in the hypothalamus.
2875.41 And, of course, those are
also going to interact
2877.38 with neurons of the prefrontal cortex
2879.5 which is the area of a brain
involved in decision making
2881.61 the, you know, I think it was
the shrimp that made me sick.
2885.26 I'm going to, I just don't
want any more of that.
2887.35 Or I'm never going back
to that restaurant again
2890.17 because after I ate there
about an hour later,
2893.0 I started feeling really not well.
2894.61 I felt, you know, kind of feverish,
2895.99 but my gut didn't feel well,
2897.09 my digestion was really off.
2899.14 All of that kind of information
2900.31 is handled in the prefrontal
cortex at a conscious level,
2903.76 but the immediate decision to stop eating
2906.03 or to eat more of something
to move towards something
2908.3 or away from it, that's
made by neural circuits
2910.43 that reside at the, we would say,
2912.73 the subconscious level
2914.19 but what we really mean is below
the level of the neocortex.
2916.86 Below the cortex means
essentially below our level
2919.73 of conscious awareness.
2921.03 So we talked about two types
of information within the gut
2923.7 that are communicated to the brain,
2925.35 chemical information, meaning information
2927.34 about the nutrients
that happen to be there,
2929.13 and mechanical information,
2929.963 distention of the gut or lack
of distention and so forth.
2933.44 And we talked about how
these neuropod cells
2935.59 can signal the release
of dopamine and circuits
2937.46 within the brain to cause you
to seek out more of something.
2940.61 Now, in a very logically consistent way,
2944.7 dopamine is also involved in
the whole business of vomiting.
2948.83 You might think, well, that
doesn't make any sense.
2950.39 I thought dopamine was
always a good thing.
2952.14 It's involved in moderation
and reward, et cetera.
2954.81 But it turns out the area postrema,
2956.58 this vomit center in the brain stem,
2959.49 is chockablock full of dopamine receptors.
2962.13 And if dopamine levels go too high,
2964.73 it can actually trigger vomiting.
2966.41 And this we see in the
context of various drugs
2969.52 that are used to treat
things like Parkinson's.
2971.62 Parkinson's is a deficiency in dopamine
2974.053 or a lack of dopamine neurons typically
2976.17 that causes a resting tremor,
2977.49 difficulty in movement,
2978.64 because dopamine's also associated
2980.0 with a lot of the neural
circuits for movement.
2983.19 Many drugs that are used
to treat Parkinson's
2986.01 like L-DOPA increase
levels of dopamine so much,
2989.92 or at least activate dopamine receptors
2992.88 to such a great degree in
certain areas of the brain
2995.95 that they can cause activation of things
2998.41 like the trigger to vomit.
3001.75 Now, this should also make
sense in the natural context
3004.24 of if you gorge yourself with food,
3005.82 gorge yourself with food,
gorge yourself with food,
3008.14 the neurons in your gut
that respond to that
3011.22 are simply detecting the
presence of nutrients
3013.54 but they don't really
make decisions themselves.
3016.38 They don't know to stop eating.
3018.14 Your brain knows to stop
eating or to eject that food.
3021.25 And so it's a wonderful
thing that those neurons
3023.61 are communicating with areas of the brain
3025.61 not just that stimulate
consuming more food
3027.93 but that are communicating
with areas of the brain,
3031.12 for instance, area postrema,
3032.78 that when dopamine levels get too high,
3035.97 cause us to either stop eating that food
3038.86 or in the case of vomiting
to eject that food.
3041.95 So I raise this not to give you
3044.39 a kind of a disgusting counterexample
3046.77 to what we call appetitive behaviors,
3049.04 the things that we like to do more of,
3051.12 but simply to give you a
sense of just how strongly
3054.49 even these reflexes that we think of
3056.38 as feeling sick and vomiting
3058.27 or the desire to seek out more food
3060.26 are really being controlled
by a kind of push-pull system,
3063.23 by parallel pathways that
are arriving from our gut
3065.47 and the same neurochemicals,
in this case dopamine,
3068.19 are being used to create
two opposite type behaviors,
3072.19 one behavior to consume more,
3073.75 one behavior to get rid of everything
3075.24 you've already consumed.
3076.51 So our brain is actually sensitive
3078.64 to the amount of signaling
coming from our gut
3081.44 not just the path by
which that signal arrives.
3085.04 Our brain is very
carefully paying attention
3088.87 to whether or not the levels of dopamine
3090.45 that are being triggered
are within a normal range
3092.91 for typical eating behavior
3094.26 or whether or not we've gorged ourselves
3095.74 to the point where enough already.
3097.67 Now, of course, mechanical signals
3100.06 will also play into area postrema
3103.75 and into the vomiting reflex.
3105.02 If we have a very distended gut,
3106.44 we feel lousy.
3107.3 It just, it actually can hurt very badly,
3109.53 and we will have the desire to vomit,
3111.53 or we will just simply vomit.
3114.96 Mechanical and chemical signals
3116.59 are always arriving in parallel.
3118.38 They never work in unison.
3120.98 And so now we have chemical
signals, mechanical signals,
3124.7 and now I'd like to talk about
direct and indirect signals
3127.61 because almost everything
I've talked about up until now
3130.64 are direct signals, a neural
pathway that converges
3133.01 in the brain to create
a particular feeling,
3134.7 thought, or behavior,
3135.95 but there are also indirect pathways.
3138.32 And that's what takes us
back to the gut microbiome
3141.27 and to these little microbiota.
3142.91 And to just give you the takeaway
message at the front here
3146.23 and then I'll give you
a little more detail
3148.41 as to how it comes about,
3150.8 you have neurotransmitters in your brain
3153.87 and in your spinal cord and in your eyes
3155.58 and in your peripheral nervous system.
3157.27 They cause the activation
or the suppression
3159.85 of nerve activity,
3161.13 meaning they either electrically
activate other nerve cells
3164.1 or they cause other nerve cells
3165.29 to be less electrically active.
3166.96 And they do that by way
of neurotransmitters.
3170.15 But as it turns out,
3171.56 the gut microbiota are capable
3173.95 of influencing metabolic events
3175.78 and in some cases are capable
3177.4 of synthesizing
neurotransmitters themselves.
3180.23 So what that means is
that these little bugs,
3182.54 these little microbiota
that are cargo in your gut,
3185.16 the six pounds of cargo,
3186.79 they actually can make neurochemicals
3188.58 that can pass into the bloodstream
3190.55 and into your brain and actually impact
3192.48 the other cells of your
body and brain indirectly,
3195.57 so without involving these
very intricate nerve pathways
3198.13 that we've been talking about.
3199.74 In other words, the foods you eat,
3203.49 the environment of your gut microbiome,
3205.8 can actually create
the chemical substrates
3207.95 that allow your brain to
feel one way or the other,
3210.36 to feel great or to feel lousy,
3212.2 to seek out more of a
particular type of behavior
3214.95 or to avoid that behavior.
3216.36 And that would constitute
indirect signaling.
3218.8 So I've been talking a lot
about the structure and function
3221.36 of the gut-to-brain pathway,
3223.03 focusing mainly on feeding behaviors
3225.88 and in some cases avoiding
feeding or even ejecting food
3229.14 from the digestive tract,
3231.07 I'd like to drill a little bit deeper
3232.79 into this indirect signaling pathway
3235.16 from the gut to the brain
3236.36 because it bridges us
nicely from neuronal signals
3240.08 in the gut to the brain,
3241.5 hormonal signals from
the gut to the brain,
3244.07 to what also includes the microbiome,
3246.57 which is what we started talking about
3248.07 at the beginning of the episode.
3250.77 As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago,
3254.27 certain gut microbiota
can actually synthesize
3257.01 certain neurotransmitters
that can go impact the brain.
3259.71 And we actually have some
knowledge about which microbiota
3262.92 can synthesize particular
neurotransmitters.
3265.24 For instance, the neuromodulator dopamine
3268.24 can be synthesized
3269.36 by or from bacillus and serratia.
3274.09 Now, these are just names of microbiota.
3276.3 I don't expect that any of you
3277.75 would necessarily recognize them.
3279.11 These aren't the sorts of
things that you necessarily
3280.59 would run out and buy
to get more dopamine.
3283.19 But the point is that
particular gut microbiota
3287.24 can create dopamine in our gut
3289.79 that can get into our bloodstream
3291.35 and can generally change our
baseline levels of dopamine
3295.15 within the brain and
other areas of the body.
3298.21 I mentioned baseline levels of dopamine
3300.04 because as I talked about on
an episode all about dopamine
3303.53 but I'll just repeat the basics here now,
3307.17 we have baseline levels
3308.56 of transmitters or neuromodulators
3310.99 that act as sort of the level of the tide,
3313.63 the overall level,
3314.94 and then we can have peaks of dopamine
3316.88 that are created by behaviors
3318.44 or by ingestion of particular
foods or drugs, et cetera.
3321.71 So bacillus and serratia tend to increase
3325.42 our baseline levels of dopamine.
3328.15 So if it turns out that we are creating
3330.9 the right gut microbiome environment
3333.81 that these particular gut
microbiota can thrive in,
3338.01 well, then our baseline levels
of dopamine will be elevated
3341.4 and in general, that leads
to enhancement of mood.
3344.9 Similarly, there are other gut microbiota,
3348.63 for instance, candida,
streptococus, various enterococcus,
3353.29 these always have these kind of strange
3354.98 and not so attractive
names, at least to me
3357.09 as a neurobiologist.
3358.44 Nonetheless, those particular microbiota
3361.86 support the production of
or can even be metabolized
3365.6 into serotonin, which is a neuromodulator
3368.85 associated with mood,
with social interactions,
3372.02 with a huge number of different types
3374.0 of events and behaviors.
3375.81 Again, these gut microbiota when present
3380.24 and allowed to thrive in our gut
3382.03 will increase our overall
levels of serotonin
3385.67 and riding on top of
that level of serotonin
3389.02 will be the serotonin
that's specifically released
3391.73 in response to certain behaviors.
3393.67 And I really want to drive home this point
3395.98 of baselines and peaks.
3397.73 The baseline level of serotonin
might set our overall mood,
3400.79 whether or not we wake
up feeling pretty good
3402.947 or really lousy if our serotonin levels
3405.79 happen to be very, very low,
3407.42 whether or not we tend to
be in a kind of a calm space
3410.13 or whether or not we tend
to be somewhat irritable.
3412.53 But then of course individual
events as we go about our day,
3416.08 maybe a compliment that we get
3417.49 or maybe somebody says
something irritating to us,
3419.9 whatever it may be will also
influence levels of serotonin,
3422.92 but those serotonin events
are going to be related
3425.83 to events at particular
neural circuits in the brain.
3428.92 And this is an important topic
3430.54 because I think that a lot of
people hear quite accurately,
3434.13 oh, 90 to 95% of our serotonin
is manufactured in the gut.
3438.4 And indeed that's true.
3439.32 It's manufactured from
the sorts of microbiota
3441.81 that I just described.
3443.74 And there are many, many experiments now,
3445.18 mostly in animal models,
3446.32 but also some in humans that
show that if the gut microbiome
3450.36 is deficient in some way to
these particular bacteria,
3454.92 that serotonin levels drop
and people's mood suffers,
3457.46 maybe even their immune system functions,
3459.52 maybe even it exacerbates
certain psychiatric illnesses.
3463.88 However, a lot of people take that to mean
3465.66 that the serotonin of the
brain all comes from the gut
3470.13 or mostly comes from the gut.
3471.6 That's not the case.
3472.433 It's still the case that you
have neurons in the brain
3474.87 that are responsible
for releasing serotonin
3477.26 directly in response to certain
things like social touch
3480.2 or through other types of
positive social experiences.
3484.16 So we've got gut microbiota
3487.55 that can literally be turned into dopamine
3490.12 and raise our baseline levels of dopamine.
3491.84 We've got gut microbiota
3493.01 that can literally raise our
baseline levels of serotonin.
3496.41 And indeed there are other gut
microbiota like lactobacillus
3499.77 or bifidobacterium, excuse me,
3503.98 hard complex names to pronounce,
3506.14 bifidobacterium that can give rise
3509.07 to increases in GABA levels,
3510.92 this inhibitory neurotransmitter
3512.41 that can act as a little
bit of a mild sedative,
3514.78 can reduce irritability, et cetera,
3517.28 but that's just the baseline,
3518.96 the kind of tide of those neuromodulators.
3521.32 Again, I want to emphasize
that we still have
3522.543 neurocircuits within the brain and body
3524.7 that are specifically
releasing in a very potent way
3527.9 dopamine, serotonin, and GABA.
3530.12 So the two things act in concert.
3532.31 Even though the gut and
the brain are acting
3534.67 both in parallel and directly
influencing one another,
3539.13 it is a powerful synergistic effect.
3541.86 And there are now hundreds of studies,
3544.27 maybe even thousands by this point,
3546.86 mostly performed in animal models,
3549.56 typically mice, but also
some studies in humans
3552.29 that show that creating
the correct environment
3555.59 for these gut microbiota to thrive
3557.35 really does enhance mood and wellbeing.
3560.6 And that when our gut
microbiome is not healthy,
3565.24 that it really can deplete our
mood and sense of wellbeing.
3568.83 Now, there are two major phases
3571.54 to creating a healthy gut microbiome.
3573.95 One you can control and the other one
3576.15 is less under your control.
3578.66 I get into this in a lot of detail
3580.89 in the episode with Dr. Sonnenburg,
3582.78 which is coming out
immediately after this one,
3586.56 the following Monday, that is.
3588.54 But for now I want to just
capture a few of the main points
3592.47 about the early establishment
of the gut microbiome.
3596.72 It turns out that the environment
3599.76 that we are exposed to,
3601.11 the things that come into
contact with our skin
3602.85 and digestive tract and
any other mucosal lining,
3605.48 even the urethra, the nasal passages,
3608.42 any opening to the outside world
3611.02 that brings in certain, excuse me,
3613.64 certain microbiota in the
first three years of life
3617.85 is going to have a profound impact
3620.16 on the overall menu of microbiota
3622.96 that we will be able to
carry within our body.
3627.33 And it really does seem
that getting exposure to
3630.36 and building a diverse microbiome
3632.35 in those first three years is critical.
3634.93 There's a lot of speculation and some data
3637.61 as to cesarean delivered babies
3640.55 having less diverse microbiomes
3643.14 compared to vaginally delivered babies.
3644.8 There have been attempts,
3645.99 although not conclusive attempts,
3648.02 to link that to the presence
of autism spectrum disorders,
3651.64 which at least by some statistics
3653.62 seem to be of higher probability
in cesarean deliveries
3657.82 although there are other
studies that refute that,
3660.45 and I want to make that clear.
3663.11 However, it's clear that
babies do not get much,
3666.27 if any, exposure to
microbiota inside of the womb,
3670.47 maybe a little bit, but not much.
3671.92 But that is during the birth process
3673.69 and in the days and
weeks immediately after
3677.3 they arrive in the world
that their gut microbiome
3679.97 is established, that those gut microbiota
3682.58 take residence within the gut.
3684.41 So it will depend on whether
or not they were breastfed
3686.5 or bottle fed.
3687.4 It'll depend on whether
or not they were exposed
3689.46 to a household pet or not,
3690.82 whether or not they were
held by multiple caregivers
3693.4 or just by one,
3694.3 whether or not they were a preemie baby
3696.22 and were contained in a
particularly restrictive environment
3699.73 in order to encourage
their further development
3701.57 before they could be brought home or not.
3703.73 I don't want to give the picture
that if you were isolated
3706.75 or you were delivered by C-section,
3708.79 that you're somehow doomed
to have a poor microbiome.
3710.83 That's simply not the case.
3712.56 However, it is the case
that the more diversity
3715.57 of microbiota that one
can create early in life
3720.09 is really helpful for long-term outcomes
3723.41 in terms of brain-to-gut signaling,
3726.46 gut-to-brain signaling,
3727.87 and for sake of the immune system.
3731.83 There are some decent studies showing
3734.18 that if children are exposed
3736.33 to a lot of antibiotic
treatment early in life,
3739.6 that can be very
detrimental to establishment
3741.97 of a healthy gut microbiome.
3743.8 And fortunately that reestablishing
a healthy gut microbiome
3747.32 can help rescue some of those deficits.
3749.71 So doctors nowadays are much more cautious
3752.57 about the prescription of
antibiotic drugs to children
3756.2 in their early years, not
just up to three years,
3758.26 but extending out to five
and seven and 10 years.
3761.02 And even in adults, they're
very, very careful about that,
3764.62 or they ought to be.
3766.16 One reason is the
existence, or I would say,
3769.36 the proliferation of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria
3772.99 that are becoming more common
in hospitals and elsewhere
3775.8 and that can cause serious problems.
3777.54 But in addition to that,
3778.47 because of this understanding
that the gut microbiome
3780.98 is influencing and actually
creating neurotransmitters
3784.03 that can impact mood and mental health,
3786.01 impact immune health, and so on.
3788.18 As I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds
3789.79 if not thousands of studies
emphasizing the key role
3792.93 of the microbiome on brain health,
3795.53 psychiatric health, et cetera.
3798.08 I want to just highlight
a few of those studies
3800.61 and in particular, some recent
studies that come from labs
3803.92 that have been working
on this sort of thing
3805.09 for a very long time.
3806.65 One of the more exciting
studies comes from the work
3808.9 of Mauro Costa-Mattioli's lab,
3811.12 which is at Baylor College of Medicine.
3813.24 Mauro's lab has been
working on mouse models
3816.2 of autism spectrum
disorder for a long time,
3819.19 and looking at social behavior
3821.32 using a mouse model for a long time.
3823.55 And they've been able to identify
3826.26 particular types of microbiota
3829.05 that when they take resonance in the gut
3832.46 can help offset some of
the symptoms of autism,
3836.52 at least the symptoms of autism
3837.87 that exist in these mouse models, okay?
3839.52 So again, this is not human work.
3841.44 This is work being done on mouse models
3843.05 for the simple reason that you can do
3844.9 these kinds of manipulations,
3846.07 where basically they took mice
3847.92 that were in germ free-environments
3849.33 or non-germ-free environments,
3851.61 or they exposed mice to
particular microbiota
3854.01 and not other microbiota
3855.44 and they discovered that
a particular microbiota
3858.73 called L. reuteri,
3859.97 it's L. R-E-U-T-E-R-I.
3864.09 Treatment with L. reuteri
corrects the social deficits
3868.41 present in these autism models
3870.2 and it does so by way of
activating our old friend
3873.02 the vagus nerve,
3874.34 but not simply because the vagus nerve
3876.62 triggers the release of dopamine,
3878.28 but it turns out that this
particular gut microbiota
3881.14 L. reuteri can correct the social deficits
3883.67 in this autism spectrum disorder model.
3885.99 It does that by way of
a vagal nerve pathway
3888.27 that stimulates both dopamine
release and oxytocin release.
3891.02 And they establish this
really mechanistically
3893.0 by showing, for instance,
3893.833 if you get rid of the oxytocin receptor,
3895.92 you don't see this rescue.
3897.52 Now, those are mouse models
3898.66 so we have to take those with
the appropriate grain of salt,
3901.75 but they're really exciting.
3902.81 And they come to us in
parallel with other studies
3906.88 that are being done,
3907.8 taking the microbiomes of people
3911.16 who have one condition
or lack of condition,
3913.81 and putting it into people
who have one condition
3916.51 or another condition.
3917.44 Let me explain what I mean by that.
3920.32 The early discovery of the gut microbiome
3922.37 and its potential to impact health
3925.27 was not in the context of
the gut-to-brain pathway
3928.51 but rather it was in
the context of colitis.
3930.83 This dates back to studies in the '50s,
3933.36 whereby people with very
severe intractable colitis
3936.95 for which no other
treatment was going to work
3939.15 received fecal transplants.
3940.87 So yes, that's exactly as it sounds.
3942.75 Taking the stool of healthy
people who do not have colitis,
3946.17 transplanting those stools
into the lower digestive tract
3949.61 of people who do have colitis,
3951.37 and they saw significant improvement,
3953.93 if not rescue of the colitis.
3955.98 That was one of the first indications
3957.45 that something within
stool, of all things,
3960.85 could actually rescue another
individual from disease,
3964.75 which sounds kind of wild and crazy,
3967.08 and may even sound
disgusting to some of you,
3969.41 but as I mentioned at the
beginning of the episode,
3972.96 almost 60% of stool is
live or dead bacteria,
3977.74 microbiota, and it really
opened up this entire field
3981.78 of exploring how different microbiota
3983.818 might have therapeutic effects.
3986.39 And indeed, that has
been shown to be the case
3988.93 also in fecal transplants for
certain psychiatric illnesses.
3992.94 These are still ongoing studies.
3995.31 They vary in quality.
3997.59 These are hard studies to
do for all sorts of reasons,
4000.42 getting the appropriate
patient populations,
4002.17 getting agreement, et cetera,
4004.55 making sure that everything's
handled properly.
4006.84 But what this involves
is fecal transplants
4009.39 from individuals that lack
4011.443 a particular psychiatric condition
4013.21 or metabolic condition into people
4015.62 who have a particular metabolic condition
4018.01 and there has been tremendous
success in some cases.
4020.71 One of the more powerful
and salient examples
4023.64 is for obesity.
4024.98 There's some people for
which even if they ingest
4026.93 very low numbers of calories,
4029.46 even if they go on a liquid protein diet,
4031.48 simply can't lose weight.
4033.72 These are somewhat rare disorders
4034.96 but these are people that would
4036.16 either get gastric bypass surgery.
4038.36 Some people are now getting
these fecal transplants
4040.42 from people that have
4043.126 healthy weight and they
take the stool from them,
4048.53 they put it into lower digestive tract,
4050.42 and they can see substantial
improvement in weight loss
4054.4 in people that were
otherwise unable to do that.
4056.5 In some cases, actually
they can start eating
4059.02 relatively normal levels of
food and still lose weight.
4061.29 So pretty remarkable
4062.29 and that tells us there's
something in these microbiota
4064.5 that's really powerful.
4065.9 Now, how those effects
are generated isn't clear.
4069.15 One idea is that it's
impacting the metabolome,
4073.2 components of the metabolism,
4074.62 almost certainly that's
going to be the case.
4076.61 Another idea is that it's
impacting neurotransmitters
4079.41 which change behavior and
food choices within the brain.
4082.49 Although, as I mentioned,
some of these people
4083.8 are already eating very
little food to begin with
4086.75 so that's a little bit harder
of an argument to create.
4090.74 There are also some
somewhat famous examples now
4093.21 of how fecal transplants can
lead to negative outcomes.
4097.67 But those negative
outcomes further underscore
4099.44 the power of the microbiome
in impacting bodily health.
4104.53 One key example of this, for instance,
4106.75 is transfer of fecal
matter into another person
4111.09 in order to treat something like colitis
4113.26 and it effectively does that,
4115.87 but if the donor of the
stool, of the fecal matter
4120.67 happened to be obese or have
some other metabolic syndrome,
4123.73 it's been observed that the recipient
4125.47 can also develop that metabolic syndrome
4127.94 simply by way of receiving
4130.37 that donor's particular microbiota.
4133.32 So these microbiota can
create positive outcomes
4135.86 or they can create negative outcomes.
4137.99 Now, most of us of course,
are not interested in
4140.33 or pursuing fecal transplants.
4141.76 Most people are interested
in just creating
4143.59 a healthy gut microbiome environment
4145.75 for sake of immune system
and brain function.
4147.6 And we will talk about how to
do that in just a few minutes.
4150.76 But I just want to further underscore
4153.47 the power of the microbiota
in shaping brain chemistry
4157.98 and in shaping things like mood
4160.17 or other aspects of mental health
4161.54 that typically we don't
associate with our gut.
4164.47 There are several studies
published in recent years,
4166.78 one that I'll just highlight now,
4168.24 first author is Tonya Nguyen, N-G-U-Y-E-N.
4172.5 The title of the paper is
4173.567 "Association of Loneliness and Wisdom
4176.23 with Gut Microbial
Diversity and Composition,
4178.87 an Exploratory Study".
4180.35 It's an interesting study.
4181.57 Looked at 184 community
dwelling adults, excuse me,
4186.0 ranging from 28 to 97 years old.
4189.22 They explored whether or not
4192.16 having enhanced microbial diversity
4194.63 somehow related to these variables
4196.81 that they refer to as
loneliness and wisdom.
4198.64 They used a number of different
tests to evaluate those.
4202.18 Those are common tests in
the psychology literature,
4204.64 not so much in the biology literature,
4206.42 but nonetheless, there are
ways of measuring things
4208.95 like loneliness and wisdom,
4212.14 wisdom in this case, being
the opposite of loneliness,
4216.55 at least in the context of this study.
4218.08 And what they found was the
more microbial diversity,
4220.7 the more diverse one's microbiome was,
4222.97 the lower incidence of loneliness.
4225.87 And they did this by taking fecal samples,
4228.14 profiling them for RNA.
4229.53 So essentially doing gene
sequencing of the stool
4231.67 of these individuals,
4232.8 getting ratings of how lonely
or not lonely they felt,
4235.76 and correlating those.
4237.06 And that's just but one study.
4238.76 I point it out because
it's particularly recent
4241.22 and it looked like it was
particularly well done.
4243.65 There is another study that
I'll just refer you to.
4245.61 This was a study published in
2020 in "Scientific Reports".
4249.27 The title of the study
is "Emotional Wellbeing
4251.12 and Gut Microbiome
Profiles by Enterotype".
4254.27 What I particularly like about this study
4255.77 is that they were able
to correlate the presence
4257.8 of certain microbiota with
feelings of subjective wellbeing
4262.65 and lack of or presence
of depressive symptoms.
4266.59 They did high-throughput gene sequencing
4268.81 of the microbiomes of individuals.
4270.56 So that meant measuring the microbiota,
4273.48 figuring out which
microbiota were present,
4275.67 how diverse their
microbiome was in general.
4278.09 Gut microbiome diversity is a good thing.
4280.81 And then to correlate
that with what's called
4283.06 the PANAS score.
4286.27 PANAS stands for positive
affect negative affect schedule.
4289.92 This is a test that my
lab has used extensively,
4291.93 that other labs to use to
evaluate mood and wellbeing.
4294.87 And they defined what were
called three enterotypes,
4298.65 three different categories of people
4300.13 that ate very different diets
4302.17 that tended to fall into
categories of having more
4304.85 or fewer emotional
symptoms that were negative
4308.88 or more fewer emotional
symptoms that were positive
4312.09 and whether or not they tend
to be more depressed, anxious,
4315.3 or have more stress-related
behaviors, et cetera.
4317.8 And what they were able
to derive from this study
4321.01 was some strong indications
about what types of things
4324.17 we should ingest in our diet,
4325.97 maybe even certain things
that we should avoid,
4327.74 but certainly the types of
things that we should ingest,
4330.13 that can enhance mood and wellbeing
4332.45 and can tend to shift people away
4334.67 from more depressive-like anxiety
4336.86 and stress-related symptoms.
4338.28 Before we get into what the
particular food items were
4340.96 that lend themselves to
a healthy microbiome,
4343.78 I want to raise a bigger and
perhaps more important issue,
4345.77 which is what is a healthy microbiome.
4349.82 I think if you asked any
number of world experts,
4352.11 and I certainly ask
this of Dr. Sonnenburg,
4353.89 what is a healthy microbiome,
4355.49 they're all going to tell you
4356.43 it's a microbiome that
has a lot of diversity,
4358.98 that includes a lot of
different types of bacteria.
4361.857 And that makes sense
4363.14 because it logically
would include the bacteria
4366.49 that produce GABA and
dopamine and serotonin,
4368.88 and that support the immune system,
4370.47 and do a number of different things.
4371.93 But is it simply the case that
adding microbiota diversity
4376.41 is always a good thing?
4378.48 Well, that doesn't seem to be the case.
4382.23 Probiotics and prebiotics,
4384.05 both of which can enhance
microbiotal diversity,
4387.01 can improve mood, digestion,
immune system, and so on.
4390.69 That's been established but
it's mainly been established
4392.99 in the context of
post-antibiotic treatment
4395.91 or people that are recovering from illness
4397.74 or people that have been very stressed
4400.94 or have been dealing with
all sorts of challenges,
4404.05 mental or physical,
4405.32 and they are an attempt to
replenish the gut microbiome.
4408.95 However, it's also clear
4412.31 that excessive microbiota
4415.47 brought about by excessive
intake of probiotics
4418.72 can lead to things like brain fog.
4420.28 There's actually some good
studies that point to the fact
4422.85 that certain metabolites
of the microbiome,
4426.42 certain chemicals produced in the gut
4428.32 and in the body can actually
lead to brain fog states.
4431.89 This is thought to come about
through the lactate pathways
4435.03 of the gut that can then impact the brain.
4438.0 If you want to look more into this issue
4440.13 of whether or not probiotics
taken in excess perhaps
4444.36 can lead to brain fog,
4446.55 I'd encourage you to look
at a particular paper.
4448.37 This is a paper published
4449.33 in "Clinical and Translational
Gastroenterology".
4452.82 And the title of the paper
4453.653 is "Brain Fogginess, Gas, and Bloating,
4455.61 a Link Between SIBO Probiotics
and Metabolic Acidosis".
4459.61 It was published in 2018.
4460.81 We can provide a link to this study.
4462.46 And there are several other
studies in the references
4465.59 that point to the fact that in some cases,
4469.93 excessive intake of probiotics
and excessive proliferation
4472.87 of gut microbiota can
actually be problematic.
4476.12 I mention this not to confuse you
4477.77 but because it is confusing out there.
4481.13 We all would think that just increasing
4482.92 microbiotal diversity
is always a good thing
4485.79 but there are thresholds
4487.98 beyond which excessive
microbiotal diversity
4490.81 might be problematic.
4492.05 I think everyone agrees that having
4494.12 too few microbial species
living in us is not a good idea.
4499.48 Now, none of that answers the questions
4501.08 that I think everyone
really wants answers to,
4503.97 which are, what should we do,
4506.45 what should we not do to
improve our gut microbiome?
4509.31 I mean, clearly we can't time travel back
4511.81 to when we were zero to three years old
4514.01 and get a dog if we didn't have a dog,
4516.78 get breastfed if we weren't breastfed,
4518.92 be delivered vaginally as
opposed to by C-section
4521.61 if we didn't have that opportunity.
4523.3 We just can't time travel and do that.
4525.32 All of us, however, should
be seeking to improve
4527.85 the conditions of our gut microbiome
4529.39 because of the critical
ways in which it impacts
4532.01 the rest of our brain and bodily health.
4534.71 So what should we do,
what shouldn't we do?
4536.52 Clearly we know that stress
can negatively impact
4539.06 the gut microbiome.
4541.11 However, some forms of
stress that can quote unquote
4544.04 negatively impact the microbiome
4545.69 include fasting, long periods of fasts,
4548.09 which makes sense because a
lot of microbiota need food
4551.63 in order to thrive.
4552.9 In fact, many if not all
of them do at some point.
4557.55 There are other questions
4558.44 such as should we eat particular foods
4561.01 and how often should we eat those foods?
4562.99 We've all been told that
fiber is incredibly important
4565.96 because of the presence
of prebiotic fiber,
4568.73 which can essentially feed the microbiome,
4571.68 but is fiber really necessary
4575.05 and how necessary is it to
encourage a healthy microbiome?
4577.98 Clearly, there are a number of people
4579.4 following relatively low fiber diets,
4581.65 such as ketogenic diets,
4582.93 and those can have, in some cases,
4585.31 anti-inflammatory
effects and can sometimes
4588.38 also improve certain microbiota species.
4591.09 So it can all be rather confusing.
4592.47 And for that matter, I
asked our resident expert,
4595.89 Dr. Justin Sonnenburg at Stanford,
4598.85 all of these questions.
4599.82 And he answers them very systematically
4601.88 in the episode that
comes out after this one.
4605.03 But I don't want to
withhold anything from you
4606.66 so I'll just give a
very top contour version
4609.32 of those answers and then
you'll get more in-depth answers
4612.55 during that episode.
4614.17 I asked about fasting.
4615.44 And the reason I asked about
fasting is that years ago,
4617.86 I was at a meeting as part
4619.31 of the Pew Biomedical Scholars Meeting
4622.15 and one of the other
Pew Biomedical Scholars
4625.6 was an expert in gut microbiome
4627.21 and I said, "Hey, are probiotics
good for the microbiome?
4631.58 And if so, which ones should I take?"
4634.23 And his answer was very interesting.
4635.51 He said, "You know, in
certain cases they can be,
4638.5 especially if you're
traveling or you're stressed,
4641.31 but it turns out that
the particular bacteria
4644.84 that they put in most probiotics
4646.75 don't actually replenish the
microbiota that you need most."
4650.78 And I thought, "Oh, well,
why don't they make ones
4652.98 that replenish the microbiota
that you need most?"
4655.67 And his answer was, "Well,
they don't replenish those
4659.28 but they replenish other ones
4661.47 that then in turn
encourage the development
4664.39 of the microbiota that you do want
4666.16 once you start eating
the appropriate foods.
4667.96 So they change the environment
4669.32 which makes the environment better,
4670.52 which indirectly supports
the proliferation
4673.34 of quote unquote good microbiota."
4675.62 Okay, so that was a
somewhat convoluted answer
4677.52 but I did appreciate his answer.
4679.02 Then I asked him about fasting.
4680.73 I said, "Well, a lot of
people are getting interested
4682.86 in intermittent fasting now.
4684.79 People are spending a significant portion
4686.94 of each 24-hour cycle avoiding food
4688.93 for sake of time restrictive feeding.
4690.37 What does that do to the gut microbiome?
4691.83 Does it make it healthier or
does it make it unhealthier?"
4694.51 Well, my colleague from
Yale and Dr. Sonnenburg
4697.95 both confirmed that
during periods of fasting,
4700.46 especially prolonged periods of fasting,
4702.44 we actually start to digest away
4703.98 much of our digestive tract.
4706.07 Now, the whole thing
doesn't start to disappear
4708.04 but there's thinning of the mucosal lining
4709.91 or the least disruption
of the mucosal lining.
4711.86 A lot of the microbiota
species can start to die off.
4715.37 And so it was surprising to
me, but nonetheless interesting
4718.97 that fasting may actually
cause a disruption
4722.11 to certain healthy elements
of the gut microbiome.
4726.15 But again, there's a caveat.
4727.44 The caveat is that when people
eat after a period of fast,
4732.1 there may be a compensatory proliferation,
4735.12 meaning an increase in
healthy gut microbiota.
4738.28 So you start to get the picture
4739.45 that fasting is neither good nor bad.
4742.1 You start to get the picture
that particular diets,
4744.83 meaning certain restriction diets
4747.73 or macronutrient-rich diets
may not be good or bad
4750.7 for the microbiome.
4751.78 And yet there are some
answers that arrive to us
4755.53 from Dr. Sonnenburg, but from
other experts in the field,
4758.46 that there are certain foods
4760.97 and certain things that we can ingest
4762.61 which definitely enhance the microbiome
4765.5 and make it healthier than it would be
4767.65 were we to not ingest those foods.
4770.12 So next I'd like to
talk about what I think
4772.27 is a really pioneering and
important study in this area.
4775.2 This is a study that was carried
out by the Sonnenburg lab
4778.7 in collaboration with Chris
Gardner's lab, also at Stanford,
4782.32 where they compared two general
types of diets in humans,
4787.15 diets that were fiber rich,
4789.24 which has been proposed
time and time again
4791.49 to enhance microbiota diversity
4794.34 and to enhance gut-brain signaling even
4796.5 and to enhance the immune system perhaps,
4799.27 and diets that were enriched
4801.24 in so-called low-sugar fermented foods.
4804.06 Before I dive into that study
and what the conclusions were
4806.87 because they are very interesting
4808.01 and very actionable for all of us,
4810.12 I do want to touch on probiotics
4812.36 because I want to avoid confusion.
4815.91 It is not the case that
ingestion of probiotics
4818.51 will always lead to brain fog.
4820.2 I want to make that clear.
4821.97 It is the case that
ingestion of probiotics,
4824.76 even if those probiotics
don't directly contain
4828.36 the microbiota species that
one is trying to proliferate,
4831.63 can be useful for improving
microbiotal diversity.
4835.89 In general, it seems that maintaining
4838.94 a healthy gut microbiome
4840.7 involves ingesting certain types of foods,
4842.987 and we'll talk about those in a moment,
4845.56 but perhaps also augmenting
the microbiota system
4850.09 through prebiotics or
probiotics at a fairly low level
4853.71 on a consistent basis.
4854.86 So these are not high dose probiotics
4856.55 except under conditions of dysbiosis
4860.32 where, for instance, if somebody has done
4862.06 a round of antibiotics
and they need to replenish
4865.54 their gut microbiome,
4867.09 there are foods and there are pill form
4869.41 and powder form prebiotics and probiotics
4871.98 that can be very useful.
4874.19 Or in cases where people
have been very stressed
4877.05 or are undergoing excessive travel
4879.56 or have shifted their diet radically,
4882.58 maybe that's due to travel,
4883.64 maybe that's due to illness,
4884.59 maybe that's due to stress.
4886.06 But when there are a number
of different converging events
4888.63 that are stressing or depleting
microbiotal diversity,
4893.63 that's when at least I
believe it can be useful
4896.29 to support the gut microbiome
4897.96 through the ingestion of quality
probiotics or prebiotics.
4902.01 So it would be under conditions
where people are stressed
4905.39 or their system is generally stressed
4907.78 for environmental or
illness-related reasons
4910.73 that it might be useful to
lean towards higher doses
4914.08 of prebiotics or probiotics
than one might normally use
4917.82 but that under normal conditions,
4919.73 that one would focus on quality nutrients
4923.24 through diet and focus on
ingestion of probiotics
4928.49 at a fairly low to moderate level,
4931.3 and/or prebiotics at a
fairly low to moderate level.
4935.05 That just seems like the logical approach
4936.77 based on the experts that I've spoken to.
4939.0 But certainly if your doctor prescribes
4942.18 or suggests that you take
high levels of probiotics
4944.61 for any reason,
4945.64 you should definitely pay
attention to your physician,
4947.22 and you should obviously pay
attention to your physician
4949.25 in any a case.
4950.24 You should never add or remove anything
4952.41 from your nutritional plan
or supplementation plan
4955.01 without consulting a physician.
4957.15 So what should we do in
order to maximize the health
4959.55 of our gut-brain axis as it's called?
4962.16 How should we support the
diversity of the good microbiota
4965.93 that help us create all
these neurotransmitters
4967.86 that we want, improve our
immune system function,
4972.06 and so on and so forth?
4973.91 Well, some of that is going
to be through the basics.
4977.74 When I say the basics,
4978.62 I mean the foundational
things that really set us up
4981.36 for overall health.
4982.27 So this is going to be getting deep sleep
4985.28 of sufficient duration 80
plus percent of the time.
4989.64 I mean, if you could get a
hundred percent of the time,
4990.95 that'd be great but very
few people accomplish that.
4992.98 It's going to be proper hydration.
4994.25 It's going to be proper
social interactions.
4996.15 It's going to be proper nutrition.
4997.73 And we'll talk more about
nutrition in a moment.
4999.26 It's going to be limiting
5000.67 excessive, prolonged stressors or stress.
5004.24 And indeed we've done episodes about,
5006.28 just about all of those things
5007.61 but certainly about stress
5009.03 we have an episode of
the Huberman Lab Podcast
5011.01 that you can find at hubermanlab.com
5012.56 all about mastering stress,
5013.85 how to avoid long periods
of intense stress,
5017.21 what to do to offset those.
5020.17 Given that stress can
disrupt the microbiome,
5023.45 whether or not you're fasting or not,
5025.97 those tools ought to be useful.
5028.49 Now, in what I consider
to be a landmark study
5031.36 exploring the relationship
between the gut microbiome,
5034.23 food intake, and overall
health is this paper
5038.06 from Justin Sonnenburg's
lab and Chris Gardner's lab,
5041.59 both of which are at Stanford.
5043.65 And the paper entitled "Gut
Microbiome-Targeted Diets
5046.53 Modulate Human Immune Status"
5048.12 was published in the journal "Cell",
5049.57 which is among the three top
journals perhaps in the world,
5052.807 "Nature", "Science", and "Cell"
5053.87 really being the apex
journals for overall science,
5058.7 and especially for biomedical sciences.
5061.16 Now, this is a very interesting study.
5063.45 It was done on humans.
There were two major groups.
5066.0 One group of humans was
instructed to increase
5069.1 the amount of fiber in their diet
5070.86 and in fact ate a high fiber diet.
5073.41 The other group was instructed to eat
5075.63 a high fermented food diet.
5078.69 Now, both groups started
off not having eaten
5082.57 a lot of fiber or a lot of fermented foods
5085.13 and were told to increase
the amount of either fiber
5087.83 or fermented foods that
they were ingesting
5089.75 over a four-week ramp up period
5091.63 and that was to avoid any
major gastric distress.
5094.69 It turns out that if you're
not already accustomed
5096.75 to eating a lot of fiber,
5097.79 increasing your amount
of fiber dramatically
5100.19 can cause some gastric distress
5102.05 but if you ease into it
over time, as we'll see,
5104.68 there's a mechanism behind this,
5105.91 which was unveiled in this study,
5108.07 but if you ease into it over time,
5109.66 then the system can tolerate it.
5111.6 Likewise high fermented foods
5114.34 can be readily tolerated
5116.18 if there's a ramp up phase of ingesting
5118.68 maybe one serving a day,
5119.81 then maybe two servings,
and ramping up in this case
5123.22 as high as six servings per day.
5126.63 However, after this ramp up period,
5129.97 the group assigned to
the high fiber condition
5132.09 maintained high fiber intake for six weeks
5134.94 and the high fermented
food group maintained
5137.33 high fermented food intake for six weeks
5140.41 after which they went off
5142.82 either the high fiber or
the high fermented food diet
5145.62 and there was a four-week follow up period
5147.71 during which they gradually
returned to baseline.
5150.47 Throughout the study their
gut microbiome was evaluated
5153.65 for the diversity of gut microbiota.
5156.24 And there were also a number of measures
5158.17 of immune system function,
5159.84 in particular measures of
the so-called inflammatome.
5163.23 The immune system has a lot of
different molecules involved.
5165.55 I did a whole episode
about the immune system
5167.23 if you're interested in learning
5168.26 what some of those molecules are,
5169.87 various cytokines and signaling molecules
5172.0 that reflect either
high inflammation states
5174.83 or reduced inflammation
states in the brain and body.
5177.42 You're welcome to check that episode.
5179.13 It's also at hubermanlab.com.
5181.66 Regardless, in this study,
5184.04 they explored the sorts of immune markers
5187.44 that were expressed in
either of the two groups
5189.63 and compared those.
5190.9 The basic takeaway of this paper
5192.83 was that contrary to what they predicted,
5197.23 the high fiber diet did not lead
5199.16 to increased microbiota diversity,
5201.47 at least not in all cases.
5203.05 And that was somewhat surprising.
5205.55 You know, the idea is that prebiotic fiber
5208.18 and a lot of the material
in fruits and vegetables
5210.76 and grains and so forth
5212.96 are supposed to support
microbiotal diversity
5216.42 and the proliferation
of existing microbiota.
5219.38 And that is not what they observed,
5221.68 although I want to be
very clear in pointing out
5223.64 that the results do
not indicate that fiber
5226.84 is not useful for health overall,
5230.09 but it does point to the fact
that increasing fiber intake
5233.07 did not increase microbiota diversity,
5235.15 which in general, as I mentioned before,
5237.6 is associated with improvements
in microbiota function,
5241.97 health, and overall wellbeing.
5244.93 Now, the high fermented
food diet condition
5247.0 was very interesting.
5248.49 It resulted in increased
microbiome diversity
5251.57 and decrease inflammatory
signals and activity.
5255.07 So there was a twofer.
5256.59 Basically by ingesting
high fermented foods
5260.108 in fair abundance, right?
5261.62 You know, four to six
servings or more per day
5263.65 is a lot of fermented food intake.
5266.14 We'll talk about what
some of those foods were.
5268.16 But the outcome was very positive.
5270.39 There was a clear increase
in microbiome diversity
5273.58 and decreased inflammatory signals.
5276.07 So things like interleukin-6,
5278.8 a number of other
interleukins and cytokines
5280.75 that are associated with
increased inflammation
5283.55 in the brain and body were
reduced significantly.
5286.45 Now, let's talk a little
bit about this notion
5288.92 of number of servings, et cetera.
5290.95 One somewhat minor point of the study,
5294.01 but I think is useful in terms
5295.18 of taking an actionable stance with this
5298.03 is that the number of
servings of fermented foods
5301.28 was not as strong a
predictor of improvements
5305.44 in the inflammatome,
meaning reduced inflammation
5308.33 and improvements in microbiota diversity,
5311.0 as was the duration of
time that the individuals
5314.79 were ingesting fermented foods.
5316.63 In other words, the longer that one
5318.02 is consistently ingesting
fermented foods on a daily basis,
5321.25 the better the outcomes in
terms of the gut microbiome
5324.19 and for reducing inflammation.
5326.36 So I think that's an important point.
5328.37 And I make that point,
5329.7 especially because for a lot of people,
5332.05 even if you do this ramp up phase,
5333.38 six servings per day of fermented foods
5335.68 can seem like quite a lot.
5337.38 So what are these fermented foods?
5339.95 I think many of us are
familiar with certain cheeses
5343.48 and being fermented and
beer being fermented
5345.82 and kombucha is fermented.
5347.61 In this study, they focus specifically
5349.32 on low-sugar fermented foods.
5351.59 So this would be plain yogurt,
5354.68 in some cases, kimchi or sauerkraut.
5357.89 An important consideration, however,
5359.57 is that it needs to contain
5361.4 what are called live active cultures,
5363.17 which means there actually
have to be microbiota
5366.5 that are alive inside the sauerkraut.
5368.51 One way you know whether
or not that's happening
5370.28 is if you purchase sauerkraut
or pickles or kimchi
5374.49 from a jar or a container
5375.97 that's on the non-refrigerated shelf
5378.98 or the non-refrigerated
section of your grocery store,
5381.6 it is not going to contain
5383.43 live active cultures of microbiota.
5386.49 And likewise, if you consume yogurt
5389.47 that has a lot of sugar or
other components added to it,
5393.13 it's not going to have
the same positive effect
5395.41 on the microbiome,
5396.49 at least that's the prediction
5397.98 given some of the relationship
5399.19 between the sorts of
microbiota that live in sugar
5402.02 versus plain type yogurts.
5404.21 They gave people the option of consuming
5406.03 any number of different
low-sugar fermented food.
5408.81 So that again that could
be sauerkraut, kimchi,
5410.97 things like kefir, natto.
5413.95 In Japan, they consume natto
which is a fermented food.
5417.81 Beer was not one of the fermented foods
5420.383 that was included in
the fermented food list.
5422.88 And when we say six servings per day,
5425.15 that is indeed six, six ounce servings,
5429.1 or six, four to six ounce servings.
5431.62 It was not six servings of
what's listed on the package.
5434.86 So again, that turns
out to be a fair amount
5437.59 of fermented foods.
5438.423 How should you gauge
5439.256 whether or not you're
getting enough of this?
5440.18 Well, if you decide to
take on this protocol
5443.41 of ingesting more fermented foods,
5444.91 which at least by my read of this study
5447.19 and some of the follow up
work that's being done,
5449.22 sounds like a terrific idea
5450.93 if you want to improve your gut microbiome
5452.82 for all the great reasons
that one would want to,
5455.58 brain-body health, reduced
inflammation, and on and on,
5459.54 well then you definitely want to focus
5461.74 on fermented foods that
you enjoy consuming.
5464.46 So for you if that's kefir,
5466.22 or for you that's plain yogurt,
5467.83 or for you that's sauerkraut,
5469.23 which happens to be my personal favorite,
5472.11 then you want to make sure
that it's going to be something
5474.7 that you are going to enjoy
ingesting quite a lot of
5477.81 and that you're going to
be okay with ingesting
5480.42 probably throughout the day.
5481.9 Now, people follow different
meal schedules, of course,
5484.01 but this does require not just eating
5486.13 all the fermented foods just
before bedtime or at one meal.
5490.02 I suppose you could do that,
5491.57 but in general, it's going
to work best in terms
5493.67 of limiting gastric distress
5495.36 by spreading it out throughout the day.
5497.53 I also want to mention brine.
5499.06 Brine is the liquid that
surrounds sauerkraut.
5503.65 It's that very salty fluid.
5506.87 And that contains a lot
of active live cultures.
5509.75 And they did include or they
allowed people to include
5513.41 brine in this study.
5515.8 And in discussions with Dr. Sonnenburg,
5517.91 which we'll go into in
more detail on the episode
5521.02 that comes out next week,
5522.21 we talk a lot about the particular value
5524.19 that brine might hold
5525.4 in terms of bringing
about microbiota diversity
5528.57 because of the richness of
live cultures that it contains.
5532.06 I do want to focus for a moment
on the high fiber condition
5534.54 because there were some
interesting observations
5536.21 about the people that were
placed into that condition.
5538.81 First of all, increasing
the amount of fiber
5543.17 definitely increased the number of enzymes
5546.99 that can be used to digest fiber.
5549.84 This is in keeping with this
idea of this ramp up phase
5552.88 where accumulation of more fiber intake
5555.12 can over time lead to
less gastric distress
5557.68 but also to more utilization of fiber
5559.59 which overall should be a good thing.
5561.33 So while they didn't observe an increase
5563.83 in immune system function
5565.56 or an increase in microbiota diversity,
5567.72 there was an increase in
these fiber digesting enzymes.
5571.61 They also observed what they called
5573.09 personalized immune responses.
5575.2 There were some subgroups
within the high fiber group
5578.03 that had interesting changes in terms
5580.76 of their reactions to, or I
should say their inflammatome,
5585.12 meaning the inflammatory
markers they expressed,
5586.9 as well as their microbiota diversity.
5589.71 So there were essentially three groups.
5591.1 One group actually showed an increase
5592.97 in inflammatory markers.
5594.62 So that was quite surprising
5595.87 and probably not wonderful for the message
5599.62 that fiber is always good for us
5601.2 but that was a small cohort
within the fiber intake group.
5605.84 Another group and still another group,
5608.71 both showed reductions in
baseline microbiota diversity
5611.92 although to varying degrees.
5614.32 So I don't want to paint the
picture that fiber is bad
5616.71 but fiber certainly did not
have the positive effects
5619.12 on microbiota diversity
5620.83 that the high fermented food diet did.
5623.22 So my read of this study,
5624.38 and I think the stance
that many others have taken
5627.0 as a consequence of these data,
5629.58 is that we should be increasing
our fermented food intake,
5632.6 that that's simply a good
thing to do in order to support
5635.55 our gut microbiome and to
reduce inflammatory signals
5638.7 in our brain and body.
5640.6 And there are a number of
different ways to do that.
5642.53 I mentioned some of the particular foods.
5644.27 However, anytime you're talking
5645.38 about ingesting fermented foods,
5647.46 especially the high quality ones
5649.38 that come from the refrigerated section
5650.96 of the grocery store,
5653.56 and that have low sugar
content, et cetera,
5656.47 we do have to be considerate of cost
5658.4 because certain things like
kombuchas, for instance,
5660.44 can be quite costly.
5662.55 I should also mention some kombuchas
5663.84 actually contain alcohol, some do not,
5666.73 or contain very little amounts of alcohol.
5670.1 One way to avoid the high
cost of fermented foods
5672.84 while still being able to accumulate
5674.6 a lot of fermented food intake
5675.95 is to simply make those
fermented foods yourself.
5678.24 And this is something that
we've started exploring
5680.55 and experimenting with in our home.
5682.85 One simple way to do this
5683.85 is to just make your own sauerkraut.
5685.63 It involves very few ingredients.
5687.02 It basically involves
cabbage, water, and salt,
5690.03 but there's a specific process
that you need to follow
5692.15 in order to create these large
volumes of sauerkraut at home
5696.23 using that low cost method.
5698.38 The best resource that I know of
5700.61 in order to follow a great recipe
5703.12 to make homemade sauerkraut
would be the recipe
5706.16 for homemade sauerkraut that's contained
5707.78 in Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef".
5709.85 There's an excellent protocol there.
5711.58 It involves chopping up the
cabbage, putting into a bowl,
5713.9 mashing it up with your hands,
5716.53 which can be fun,
5718.0 putting water in there,
some salt, covering it,
5719.97 and then keeping it in a
particular environment,
5722.01 and then routinely scraping off
5723.85 some of the material from the surface.
5725.53 You have to do that in order to make sure
5727.81 that you're not getting
microbes and things
5731.78 growing in it that are bad for you.
5733.17 So you definitely want
to pay careful attention
5734.82 to the protocol, but that's
a very, very low cost way
5737.63 of generating lots and
lots of fermented foods
5740.05 so you don't go broke trying
to improve your microbiome.
5743.13 The other thing that you can do
5744.09 if you're really obsessed with kombucha
5746.53 or something like that, to
avoid the high cost of kombucha
5748.84 is there are ways that
you can get the scoby,
5751.07 which basically allows you to make
5752.3 your own kombucha at home.
5753.38 I've never tried this,
but when I was a post doc,
5755.85 there was an undergraduate in the lab,
5757.24 I think, well, I won't out him,
5759.77 but he's now gone on to medical school
5762.31 and I think he's passed his residency
5764.5 and is a practicing doctor,
5766.36 but nonetheless, he was always
making kombucha at home.
5768.8 He told me it was exceedingly
easy, but then again,
5770.9 he had a number of other
skills and attributes
5772.66 that made me think that he could do
5774.56 pretty much anything with ease,
5775.89 whereas I tend to struggle
with even basic cooking.
5778.47 So maybe if you're feeling
a little more adventurous,
5780.79 you could explore making
your own kombucha.
5783.36 But there are a number of
different protocols and recipes
5785.34 out there for making your own
low-sugar fermented foods.
5788.4 So you needn't run out
and buy fresh sauerkraut
5791.46 all the time.
5792.293 I should also mention for those
of you that are interested
5794.53 in getting your fermented
intake from pickles,
5798.7 jarred pickles rarely
if ever contain ferment.
5802.7 Mostly they're just
soaked in vinegar, water,
5805.22 and with some spices,
5806.1 but there are some that contain ferment.
5808.18 You actually have to look
for that on the container.
5810.73 And I don't know, maybe someone out there
5811.93 knows how to make natto and
knows how to make kimchi well
5814.7 and things of that sort.
5816.22 It certainly is the case based
on the data from the study
5819.15 that ingesting more servings
of fermented food per day
5822.24 ought to be beneficial
for our gut microbiome.
5824.29 And since this is an episode
not just about gut microbiome
5826.73 but gut-brain health,
5828.52 I should mention that
one form of signaling
5831.02 between the gut microbiome and the brain
5832.73 which we did not discuss
5834.05 and I'll just touch on briefly
5836.02 is that when the inflammatome
or the genes and markers
5841.03 of inflammation are
kept in a healthy range,
5845.26 there's an active signaling
of that immune system status
5848.77 to the brain.
5849.603 There's an intermediate
cell type that communicates
5852.62 immune status to the brain.
5854.34 And that cell type is the microglial cell.
5856.29 It's a type of glia as the name suggests.
5858.73 When there's a lot of
inflammation in the body,
5861.54 these microglia actually get activated
5863.81 and can start eating away
at various components
5867.23 of the brain and nervous system.
5868.47 And I don't mean massive eating away.
5869.79 They're not going to
digest the whole brain
5871.28 but these microglia are sort
of the resident macrophages
5875.26 of the brain.
5876.093 Macrophages are in the periphery
and they gobble up debris
5878.73 and things of that sort.
5879.84 The microglia on a regular
basis are eating up debris
5883.42 that accumulates across waking cycles
5885.88 and in response to
micro-damage to the brain
5888.2 that occurs on a daily basis.
5889.48 So they have a lot of
important basic everyday
5891.85 what we call housekeeping functions.
5893.76 But when there's a lot of
inflammation in the body,
5895.96 when there's a massive immune response,
5898.73 the microglia can be hyperactivated
5900.85 and that's thought to lead to any number
5902.47 of different cognitive defects
or challenges thinking,
5905.73 or maybe even some forms of
neurodegeneration over time,
5909.22 although that last point
is more of a hypothesis
5911.48 than a well tamped down
fact at this point.
5914.1 There's still a lot of
investigation to be done in humans.
5916.73 The animal data, however,
are very, very strong
5919.6 that when the immune system is activated
5921.53 or chronically activated or hyperactivated
5924.17 that neural tissue, meaning brain tissue
5925.86 and other central nervous
system tissue can suffer.
5928.02 So there are a lot of reasons to want
5930.22 to not just improve microbiome diversity,
5933.23 but to also improve immune system function
5936.2 and to limit the number
of inflammatory markers
5938.84 that are present in the body
5940.16 because of the way those
inflammatory markers
5942.36 can signal deleterious
events in the brain.
5945.38 And while eating fermented foods
5947.89 and making your own fermented foods
5949.88 and buying high quality fermented foods
5951.91 might seem like an inconvenience,
5953.79 I would say that from the perspective
5956.26 of cost-benefit or effort-benefit,
5958.8 it's actually quite a good situation
5961.08 where if you can just ramp up
the number of fermented foods
5964.23 or servings of fermented foods
that you're eating per day
5966.41 over a period of a few weeks
5967.73 so that you're tolerating that well,
5970.25 that ought to have a very positive effect
5972.27 on your microbiome diversity
5974.23 and indeed on gut-brain function.
5976.76 And I'll be the last to suggest
5978.15 that people completely forego on fiber.
5980.54 I think there's some debate out there
5981.89 as to how much fiber we
need and whether or not
5984.95 certain forms of fiber
are better than others.
5987.29 I'm not going to get into that debate.
5988.66 It's barbed wire enough without
me injecting my own views
5991.69 into that debate.
5992.8 But I think there's ample
evidence to support the fact
5995.1 that for most people ingesting
a fair amount of fiber
5998.7 is going to be a good idea.
6000.41 I would just say that
6001.243 make sure that you're also
ingesting a fair amount
6002.94 of fermented foods.
6004.2 And along the lines of fiber,
6006.14 in an accompanying article
published in "Cell",
6008.71 which was sort of a what we
call a news and views piece
6011.71 about the Sonnenburg and Gardner paper,
6015.35 they make a quite good point,
6016.92 which is that the increase in fiber intake
6019.65 that led to the increase in
carbohydrate active enzymes,
6023.15 these CAZymes as they're called,
6025.57 these are enzymes that help digest fiber,
6028.3 quote, "indicating an enhanced
capacity for the microbiome
6031.86 to degrade complex carbohydrates
present in fibrous foods".
6035.43 So in other words, eating
more fiber and fibrous foods
6040.92 allowed for an increase in these enzymes
6042.56 that allow you to eat
still more fibrous foods
6044.88 or to better digest fibrous
foods that are coming in
6047.68 through other sources.
6048.8 So there is at least one
utility for increasing fiber
6052.61 even though it's separate from
the gut microbiotal diversity
6055.59 and reducing inflammation.
6057.43 And I'd be remiss if I didn't
touch on some of the data
6059.87 and controversy about
artificial sweeteners
6062.49 and the gut microbiome.
6064.47 I want to be very clear that
what I'm about to tell you
6066.83 has only been established
in animal models,
6069.3 in a mouse model, at
least to my knowledge.
6071.82 What the studies have shown,
and there were several,
6074.59 but one published in the journal "Nature"
6076.12 a few years back is the one
6077.1 that got the most amount of attention
6078.73 is that animals that consume large amounts
6080.77 of artificial sweeteners.
6082.25 in particular things like
saccharin or sucralose
6085.06 show disruptions in their gut microbiome.
6087.67 I'm not aware of any studies in humans
6089.41 that show the equivalent effect.
6090.73 And I'm not aware of any
studies in humans that show
6093.33 the equivalent effect for things
6095.62 like plant-based, low-calorie sweeteners,
6097.84 things like Stevia, monk
fruit, and things of that sort.
6101.09 And at least by my exploration,
6103.42 I couldn't find any data specifically
6105.09 related to the sweetener aspartame.
6107.79 So right now it's somewhat controversial
6110.38 and actually this is kind of
a third rail topic out there.
6112.88 When one group will come out saying
6114.82 that artificial sweeteners are bad
6116.1 because they disrupt the gut microbiome,
6118.11 the response generally from
a number of people as well,
6121.4 that's only been shown in animal models.
6122.9 And indeed that's true.
6124.31 So right now I don't think
that there's a strong case
6126.84 one way or the other.
6128.13 I think that people should
basically ask themselves
6130.26 whether or not they like
artificial sweeteners or not,
6133.13 whether or not they're
willing to risk it or not,
6135.57 and obviously that's an individual choice.
6138.11 I also want to point out a recent study
6140.68 from Diego Bohorquez's lab,
6143.02 which actually shows, however,
that neurons in the gut,
6146.88 those neuropod cells, are
actually capable of distinguishing
6150.73 between real sugars and
artificial sweeteners.
6153.83 This is a really interesting body of work.
6156.27 It was published just now, just recently,
6158.88 I should say, February 2022.
6160.64 The title of the paper is
6161.757 "The Preference for Sugar
over Sweetener Depends
6164.15 on a Gut Sensor Cell".
6165.66 And to make a long story short,
6167.2 what they showed was there's
a category of neuropod cells
6170.36 that recognize sugar in the
gut and signal that information
6175.07 about the presence of sugar
in the gut to the brain
6178.07 via the pathways we talked about before,
6179.86 the nodose ganglia, the vagus, dopamine,
6181.66 et cetera, et cetera.
6183.61 Interestingly, the very
same category of neurons
6186.81 can respond to artificial sweeteners
6190.27 and signal that information to the brain,
6192.14 but the pattern of signaling
6194.76 and indeed the signature pattern
6197.67 that is conveyed to the brain
and received by the brain
6200.68 is actually quite a bit different
6202.76 when these same neurons are responding
6205.83 to artificial sweeteners
versus actual sugar.
6209.73 And this is very interesting
because what it means
6211.277 is first of all that neurons
6214.5 have incredible specificity
6216.18 in terms of what they are
signaling from the gut
6218.3 to the brain.
6219.48 And it also means that there
may be a particular signal
6222.9 that the brain receives that says
6224.53 I'm receiving some intake of food or drink
6228.48 that tastes sweet but doesn't
actually offer much nutrients
6232.84 in the direction of sweetness,
6234.01 meaning that it doesn't have
calories despite being sweet.
6236.74 Now, again, this is all
subconscious processing.
6239.09 And like with the previous studies
6240.9 we were just discussing
about artificial sweeteners
6243.48 generally and the gut
microbiome generally,
6245.64 it's unclear how this relates to humans
6248.97 at this point in time.
6250.22 But given the similarity
of cellular processes
6252.69 and molecular processes at the
level of gut-brain in mice,
6255.89 I think it stands to reason
that these neuropod cells
6258.43 very likely are capable of
signaling sweet presence
6261.91 of real sweetener versus
artificial sweetener
6263.74 in humans as well,
6264.96 although that still remains
to be determined empirically.
6267.66 So I'd like to just briefly
recap what I've covered today.
6270.68 I started off by talking about
the structure and function
6273.38 of the gut-brain axis.
6275.11 I described the basic
structure and function
6277.58 of the digestive pathway,
6279.55 and how that digestive pathway
harbors microbiotal species,
6282.86 meaning many, many little
bacteria that can signal
6286.92 all sorts of things to the
rest of the brain and body.
6289.9 And indeed, we talked about
the various ways they do that.
6292.5 We talked about direct pathways,
6294.5 literally nerve networks
that extend from the gut
6297.43 up to the brain and from
the brain back to the gut.
6300.43 And we talked about indirect pathways,
6302.92 how some of the gut microbiota
can actually synthesize
6306.11 neurotransmitters that get
out into the bloodstream,
6308.53 can impact the body,
6309.65 can impact the immune system,
6311.47 and can get into the brain
and act as neurotransmitters
6314.81 in the brain just as
would neurotransmitters
6317.47 that originate from within the brain.
6320.921 We also talked about what constitutes
6322.74 a healthy versus unhealthy microbiome.
6325.4 And it's very clear that
having a diverse microbiome
6328.44 is healthier than having
a non-diverse microbiome.
6332.84 But as I pointed out,
6334.66 there's still a lot of
questions as to exactly
6336.67 what microbiota species
you want to enhance
6338.9 and which ones you want
to suppress in the gut
6341.33 in order to achieve the best
gut-brain axis function.
6345.35 We talked about how things
like fasting might impact
6347.75 the microbiome and how
some of that might be
6349.81 a little bit counterintuitive
6351.21 based on some of the other
positive effects of fasting,
6353.981 or if we're not just discussing fasting,
6356.21 some other types of
somewhat restrictive diets
6358.87 either restrictive in time or restrictive
6360.75 in terms of macronutrient intake,
6362.95 how those may or may
not improve the health
6365.57 of gut microbiome.
6366.63 And the basic takeaway was
that because we don't know
6369.58 exactly how specific diets
impact the gut microbiome,
6373.07 and we don't know how fasting
6375.09 either promotes or
degrades the microbiome,
6377.86 we really can't say whether
or not they are improving
6380.5 or degrading the microbiome at this time.
6382.96 However, it is clear that stress,
6385.91 in particular chronic stress,
6387.14 can disrupt the gut microbiome.
6388.83 It's also clear, of course,
6389.81 that antibiotics can
disrupt the gut microbiome.
6392.47 And that brings us to the topic
6393.78 of prebiotics and probiotics.
6395.82 And I emphasized the fact
that for most people,
6398.42 ingesting high quality non-processed foods
6402.03 that includes some prebiotic fiber
6404.72 but also that includes some probiotics
6407.39 will probably be healthy
6408.62 but not excessive levels of probiotics.
6410.9 High levels of supplemented probiotics
6412.86 of the sort that would
come in a probiotic pill
6414.57 or even prescription probiotics
6416.54 would probably lend
themselves best to when people
6418.92 were under severe chronic stress
6421.06 or had just come off a serious round
6423.3 or an ongoing or repeated
rounds of antibiotics.
6426.78 That does not mean that
ingesting probiotics
6429.43 in any form or any kind is not good.
6431.55 It just means that the
very high dose probiotics,
6434.99 again, typically found
in prescription form
6436.98 or capsule pill form
probably are best reserved
6440.15 to cases where of course
your doctor prescribes them.
6442.86 You should always follow
your doctor's advice.
6444.76 But in cases where
perhaps you are jetlagged,
6447.3 you're traveling
excessively for any reason,
6449.8 or working excessively,
6450.83 you're not getting enough sleep,
6452.28 or your diet is radically
changed from normal.
6455.24 And we talked about how
increasing the amount of fiber
6458.26 in your diet might be
useful for increasing
6461.56 fiber digesting enzymes
and the assimilation
6464.03 of fibrous foods
6465.28 but that it's really the
ingestion of fermented foods
6468.03 and, in fact, getting anywhere from four
6470.07 or even up to six servings
a day of fermented foods
6472.45 can be immensely beneficial for reducing
6475.1 inflammatory markers in the body
6476.71 and for improving microbiota diversity
6479.87 all along the gut and
thereby improving signaling
6483.75 and outcomes along the gut-brain axis.
6487.66 So we went all the way
from structure to function
6491.06 to the four kinds of signaling,
6492.53 mechanical, chemical, indirect, direct,
6494.78 probiotics, fiber, and fermented foods.
6497.73 And I tossed in a little
bit at the end there also
6500.32 about ways that you can make
your own fermented foods
6503.45 at home in order to try and
offset some of the costs.
6505.72 Also, it's just kind of fun to do.
6507.35 And some of those
actually taste quite good.
6509.59 I've actually found that
the fermented sauerkraut
6512.59 that we're making at home actually rivals
6514.97 the sauerkraut that you can buy
6516.2 out of the refrigerated
section at the grocery store.
6519.32 And I am by no means
a skilled cook or chef
6523.0 and basically have no
culinary skill whatsoever.
6525.62 So if I can do it, you can do it.
6527.16 I hope you found this information useful
6529.08 and perhaps also actionable.
6531.8 One of my motivations
for doing this episode
6534.41 was, again, as a primer for the episode
6536.87 with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg
6538.53 where we go really deep
into the gut microbiome,
6540.8 less so into the gut-brain axis,
6542.61 but really deep into the gut microbiome,
6544.51 what it is, what it
does, what it doesn't do,
6546.61 and some of the emerging
findings from his lab
6548.59 that are yet to be published.
6550.27 And I also was excited to do this episode
6552.47 because I think many of us have heard
6554.44 about the gut microbiome.
6555.67 We hear about these bacteria
that live in our gut.
6557.9 We hear about the gut-brain axis
6559.61 or that 90% or more of
the serotonin that we make
6562.77 is made in our gut.
6563.81 We hear about the gut as a
second brain and so forth.
6566.49 But I think for many people,
6568.89 they don't really have a clear picture
6570.71 of what the gut microbiome is
6572.43 and the pathways and mechanisms
by which it can signal
6575.58 to the brain and to the
other parts of the body.
6577.92 So I hope that today's
information at least improved
6580.61 the clarity around that topic
6582.64 and leaves you with a more vivid picture
6584.64 of this incredible system
that is our gut-brain axis.

6628.45 On many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
6630.81 we talk about supplements.
6632.13 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
6634.33 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them.
6636.75 One of the key issues
with supplements, however,
6638.79 is that the quality of
supplements can vary tremendously
6641.95 and oftentimes that
relates to the precision,
6645.15 or I should say the lack of precision,
6646.69 with which companies put
different amounts of supplements
6650.28 in the capsules and tablets
that are listed on the bottle.
6653.09 For that reason, we partner
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
6655.93 because Thorne supplements
6657.4 have the highest degree of stringency
6659.2 in terms of the quality of ingredients
6660.93 and the specificity of the
amounts of the ingredients.
6663.49 That is, what is listed on the bottle
6665.25 is actually what is
contained in the capsules
6667.27 and tablets and powders.
6668.41 If you'd like to see the
Thorne supplements that I take,
6670.45 you can go to Thorne,
