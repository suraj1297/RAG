0.36 - [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
1.88 where we discuss science
3.72 and science-based tools for everyday life.
6.494 [upbeat music]
9.27 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.26 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
12.72 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.5 Today, we are talking all
about the science of gratitude.
17.6 In part, we're doing this
18.45 because of the upcoming
Thanksgiving holiday,
20.6 which of course, is all about
giving thanks, gratitude,
23.75 but also because there's
no a wealth of data
26.01 showing that having an
effective gratitude practice
29.061 can impact a huge number
of health variables;
32.88 both mental health and physical
health in positive ways.
36.1 Things like cardiovascular health,
37.53 things like relationships,
things like mental health,
40.55 things like physical and
cognitive performance.
42.76 And these are not small effects.
44.13 These are very large positive effects.
46.91 However, in researching this episode,
48.75 I was completely surprised
50.06 as to what constitutes an
effective gratitude practice.
54.73 I, I think like many of
you, would have thought
56.8 that an effective gratitude practice
58.21 simply involves writing down a few things
60.44 or many things that we're grateful for,
62.23 or thinking about those.
63.72 Or really making an effort to somaticize
67.55 or feel some of the elements of gratitude
70.9 while writing out that list
or thinking about that list.
73.73 It turns out that an
effective gratitude practice
76.55 doesn't resemble that at all.
78.33 The neuroimaging data,
the physiological data,
80.67 looking at things like inflammatory
markers, other studies,
84.52 purely looking at the
psychology and the long
87.02 and short-term effects of an
effective gratitude practice,
89.96 point to a completely different
approach to using gratitude
93.4 to positively impact health metrics.
95.87 Fortunately, these are things
96.83 that we can all do very easily.
98.71 Some of them were actually fun.
101.07 You can do them in a variety of contexts.
103.0 So today we're going to
talk about the science
104.68 of effective gratitude practices,
106.76 and we're going to describe what those are
108.31 and how you can incorporate
them into your life.
110.72 Before we dive into today's topic,
112.32 I just want to highlight
113.48 a particularly interesting set of findings
115.24 from the literature.
116.63 This is a study that came out
in the journal Cell Report,
118.99 Cell Press journal, excellent journal.
120.81 It's very relevant to today's topic.
122.97 In fact, we're going to spend
more time with this paper
124.76 a little bit later in the episode.
126.72 The study involved having
subjects listen to a story.
131.636 The subjects are all
listening to the same story,
134.81 but those subjects are not
listening to it together.
136.87 They're not rounded up in
a circle or all in a room,
139.26 they're in separate rooms
140.19 or entirely separate
locations on the planet,
143.57 or they are actually
brought into the laboratory
146.18 on separate days.
148.01 What this study found is
that different subjects
151.89 listening to the same story,
154.0 undergo the same variation in heart rate.
158.53 In other words, the gaps
between their heartbeats
161.18 start to resemble one another
in response to the same story.
165.02 Now, this is very interesting.
166.35 This is a coordination of
the physiology of the body
170.69 in response to a narrative,
a story in different people.
174.6 And yet when they line up the heart rates
177.04 of these different people
who listen to the story
179.15 at completely different times,
180.66 they find that those heart rates
182.06 map onto one another almost identically.
184.63 It's really remarkable.
186.314 We're going to talk about what this means
188.33 in terms of coordination of
neural circuits in the brain
191.18 and neural circuits in the body,
192.67 and the organs such as the heart,
194.46 but also the lungs and
other organs of the body,
196.4 and what this means for
changing one's overall state.
200.09 A key theme that's going to
come up today again and again
203.17 is the distinction between traits,
205.88 which are kind of pervasive
aspects of who we are
209.67 and how we tend to react
210.7 to different types of circumstances,
212.7 and states, which are more transient.
214.81 They tend to, you know, you
can invoke a state in somebody,
217.63 a state of fear or a state of relaxation.
220.1 But what this study
really starts to point to
222.62 is that there are specific approaches
224.35 that any of us can take
225.74 in order to really rewire
our nervous system,
228.69 such that we are calmer,
if we want to be calmer
231.53 in certain circumstances,
232.93 that we are more responsive
in certain circumstances,
235.61 if that's our goal.
236.67 So we'll return to how one
would go about doing that.
238.87 But I think these results
are just beautiful
241.57 in the sense that they really show
243.35 that our brain and our
body are highly coordinated
245.42 because people are listening to the story
246.607 and the heart rate is changing
in response to the story,
250.36 but that there is what
we call a stereotypy;
254.27 sort of stereotyped
response to a given story.
257.6 In my mind, there was no reason
258.79 why the results had to be this way.
260.61 Two people listen to the same story,
261.99 why should their heart
rates be almost identical
263.9 to the same story?
265.01 Very, very interesting and
points to the power of narrative
268.02 and story in coordinating our physiology.
270.95 And this is something
powerful that we can leverage.
273.03 Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast
275.38 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
277.97 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
279.94 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
282.61 and science related tools
to the general public.
285.42 And keeping with that theme,
286.39 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
289.21 Our first sponsor is ROKA.
291.07 ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
293.11 that are of the absolute highest quality.
295.41 I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system,
297.44 and I can tell you that the visual system
298.78 has a number of important features
300.47 that allow you to see
things with crystal clarity,
302.58 no matter what environment you're in.
304.46 So that means if you're in bright sunlight
306.16 or you go into shadows,
307.52 you should be able to
see everything clearly.
309.32 But many eyeglasses and sunglasses
311.32 actually short circuit that
feature of our visual system,
313.88 and make it such that we
have to take off our glasses,
315.9 or if our screen dims,
317.13 we feel like we can't
see things quite right.
319.12 ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses
320.98 have completely solved that problem.
322.94 In addition, they're very lightweight,
324.41 so you don't even remember
that they're on your face.
326.48 And if you get sweaty,
they don't slip off.
328.66 They were actually designed
for cycling and running
331.38 and things of that sort, but
they have a terrific aesthetic.
333.52 So I wear readers at
night or out to dinner,
335.76 or when I'm driving, I
wear their sunglasses.
337.93 And the aesthetics are really terrific,
339.21 even though they're so-called
performance glasses.
340.94 'Cause as many of you know,
342.34 performance glasses often
make people look like cyborgs.
344.73 These sunglasses and eyeglasses
have the kind of aesthetic
347.18 that you can wear them anywhere;
348.27 while cycling, running,
349.23 but also doing anything
else you might be doing.
351.57 If you'd like to try ROKA
glasses, you can go to roka.com,
354.49 that's R-O-K-A.com and

364.14 Today's podcast is also brought
to us by Inside Tracker.
367.4 Inside Tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
369.92 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
372.38 to help you better meet your immediate
373.9 and long-term health goals.
375.87 I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done.
378.79 For the simple reason
that many of the factors
381.5 that impact your immediate
and long-term health
383.76 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
386.42 And now, with the advent
of modern DNA tests,
388.88 you can also get insights into your genes
391.05 and how those affect or
should affect your immediate
393.65 and long-term health choices.
395.79 A big problem with a lot of blood tests
397.31 and DNA tests out there, however,
399.18 is that you get the data back
400.55 and you don't know what
to do with the data.
402.36 Inside Tracker has solve that problem
403.95 with a very easy to use dashboard,
406.32 where you get your numbers
back from your blood tests
408.31 or your DNA tests,
409.19 and then it points to
specific lifestyle factors,
412.05 nutritional factors, and so forth,
414.07 that can allow you to bring
the numbers into the ranges
416.23 that are optimal for you.
417.447 And this is a huge advantage
over other blood tests
420.25 and DNA tests out there.
421.88 Another feature that Inside Tracker has
423.71 is their InnerAge test.
425.74 The InnerAge test shows you
what your biological age is,
428.73 and you can compare that
to your chronological age.
431.37 And of course, your
biological age is equally,
434.62 if not more important than
your chronological age.
436.93 So this is an important number
438.22 that you can get from Inside Tracker.
440.15 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
441.69 you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,
444.94 to get 25% off any of
Inside Tracker's plans.
447.95 And if you're listening to this
449.866 during the week of Thanksgiving, 2021,
451.23 and you live in the United States,
452.97 you can get a special

466.66 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Magic Spoon.
469.55 Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,
472.12 keto-friendly cereal.
473.89 Now, I'm not following a
ketogenic nutrition plan.
476.88 What works best for me is to
fast until about 11:00 a.m.
480.22 or noon most days, and then to
eat a low carbohydrate lunch,
483.51 a low carbohydrate snack in the afternoon,
486.09 and in the evening is
when I eat my starches.
488.8 That's what allows me to
be alert throughout the day
490.64 for work, for exercise and so forth,
492.49 and then to sleep really well at night.
494.19 That's just what works for me.
495.68 But it does require
that throughout the day,
498.55 I am eating fewer carbohydrates
than I am at night.
501.02 And oftentimes I want a snack,
502.61 and the snack I want
is usually Magic Spoon.
505.61 Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,
507.59 13 to 14 grams of protein,
509.2 and only four net grams of
carbohydrates in each serving.
512.46 It's absolutely delicious.
513.8 I particularly like the frosted flavor
516.67 'cause it tastes like donuts.
517.7 And then I try not to eat donuts.
519.67 No vendetta against donuts,
520.97 but it's not really compatible
with my eating plan.
523.51 They also have flavors like
cocoa, fruity, peanut butter.
526.27 They're really delicious.
527.58 Any ideas you have about
keto-friendly cereals
529.82 and foods not being delicious,
531.6 you have to try Magic Spoon,
it'll change your mind.
533.73 In fact I'm getting hungry just
thinking about it right now.
535.98 If you want to try Magic Spoon,
537.19 you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman
to get a variety pack.
541.03 Just use the promo code

551.23 Let's talk about gratitude.
552.56 And to begin, I'd like to
emphasize the various aspects
555.04 of mental and physical health
556.25 that have been shown to benefit
557.65 from a regular gratitude practice.
559.89 There are studies showing
560.81 that performing a gratitude
practice twice or three times,
565.46 or even just once a week,
can lead to a pervasive,
568.56 a long lasting impact
on subjective wellbeing.
572.814 People report feeling
happier, more meaning, joy,
575.91 even awe for their life experience,
578.61 simply in response to
adding a gratitude practice.
581.47 The key thing is it has to be
the right gratitude practice.
583.76 And we're going to talk about
584.64 what the right gratitude
practice looks like
586.522 in just a little bit.
588.35 But there are additional
benefits of a gratitude practice.
591.675 There are studies showing that
a regular gratitude practice
596.2 can provide resilience
to trauma, in two ways;
599.75 it can provide a reframing
601.72 and resilience to prior
traumatic experiences.
604.27 So buffering people
605.22 against the negative physiological effects
607.89 and psychological effects
of earlier trauma,
610.06 but also inoculating them in many ways
613.01 to any traumas that might
arrive later in life.
616.02 So that's a powerful thing.
617.7 And today we will talk about
619.34 how that's actually accomplished.
620.6 It's actually accomplished
by shifting the way
623.31 that the fear and defense networks
625.29 in the brain actually function.
627.39 And we'll get right down
into the details of that.
629.71 The other thing that a
gratitude practice does
631.65 is it's been shown to
benefit social relationships.
634.379 But not just for the relationship
636.7 in which you express gratitude, right?
638.48 So on the face of it, you might think,
640.11 okay, if I express gratitude
for somebody over and over,
642.61 over and over, over and over,
643.88 then I'm going to feel
better about that person.
645.56 And indeed, that is one effect
of a gratitude practice.
648.41 That's called a pro-social
649.68 or interstitial social gratitude practice.
651.91 But there are now several studies,
654.84 recent studies in good
journals pointing to the fact
657.41 that a regular gratitude
practice can also enhance
660.64 one's social relationships
across the board;
663.2 in the workplace, at
school, at with family
665.82 and romantic relationships,
667.09 and even one's relationship to themselves,
668.93 which is really what
the subjective feelings
670.43 of wellbeing are.
671.55 So it's clear to me that
ineffective gratitude practice
675.29 has an outsized effect
on many, many aspects
679.28 of mental and physical health.
680.77 And for those of you
681.603 that are coming to this
conversation thinking,
683.82 gratitude practice, oh, that's
kind of wishy-washy or woo,
686.72 it's going to involve putting
your hand on your heart
688.78 and feeling into all the amazing things
690.67 that you happen to have,
691.56 even when things are really terrible,
692.95 that's not where we're going at all.
695.394 And equally important is to understand
697.93 that the neurochemical,
the anti-inflammatory
702.87 and the neural circuit mechanisms
that gratitude can invoke
708.94 are equally on par with some
of the effects of pharmacology,
713.21 of things like high
intensity interval training
715.15 and exercise, and other
things that we think of
717.33 as kind of more potent
forms of self intervention.
720.69 So if you are of the mindset
that a gratitude practice
724.15 is kind of weak sauce, buckle up,
726.81 because the data actually
points to the fact
728.71 that a gratitude practice
is a very, very potent way
732.2 in which you can steer your
mental and physical health
734.72 in positive directions,
736.4 and that those effects
are very long lasting.
738.92 Before we dive into the
tools and mechanisms
741.02 and scientific studies around gratitude,
742.69 I'd like to just set the
framework for the discussion.
745.54 Gratitude is what we call
a pro-social behavior
748.16 or a pro-social mindset.
750.64 Now, you can be grateful for something
752.84 without it involving anybody else.
754.92 So the social part isn't
meant to convey anything
757.45 about interpersonal
relations, although it can.
759.63 And today we're going to talk a lot about
761.07 how interpersonal relations
can be incorporated
763.75 into a gratitude practice
in really powerful ways.
766.64 But pro-social behaviors
are basically any behavior
769.57 or mode of thinking that
allow us to be more effective
773.91 in interactions with other
people, including ourselves.
777.49 Now pro-social is not
just a name that we give
780.38 these different tools and
practices and mindsets.
783.8 They're actually neural
circuits in the brain
786.13 that are specifically wired
787.94 for pro-social thoughts and behaviors.
790.23 And these are distinctly different
791.8 from the circuits in the brain
793.07 that are involved in defensive behaviors.
795.47 So without getting into too much detail,
797.07 just yet, we will later,
799.46 we have circuits in the brain
800.75 that are what we call appetitive.
802.69 They are designed to
bring us closer to things
805.0 and to bring us into closer relation
808.06 to the details of that sensory experience.
811.06 Now that could be a delicious
food that you're eating,
813.2 it could be interacting with a loved one,
814.84 it could be interacting with a friend
816.33 or anyone that you happen to like,
817.98 it could even be in your
relation to yourself.
819.98 These circuits that we're
calling pro-social circuits
822.55 light up in the brain in neuroimaging,
824.61 meaning the neurons are
firing more actively,
826.72 more electrically robustly;
829.425 sort of like turning up the volume
831.75 on these neural circuits in the brain.
833.7 And the neural circuits in the brain
835.4 that are associated with
aversive or defensive behaviors;
839.43 things like backing up things,
840.77 like covering up the
vital organs of the body,
842.73 things like a quaking of the voice,
844.76 all of the things are associated
with defensive behaviors
847.46 are actually antagonized,
meaning they are reduced
850.76 when the pro-social
circuits are more active.
853.82 So the framework here that I'd like to set
855.73 is that we have this kind of seesaw
857.43 of neural circuits in the brain.
858.95 One set that are
pro-social and are designed
861.81 to bring us closer to
others, including ourselves,
864.94 closer to certain sensory
experiences, right?
867.46 Because a lot of pro-social behaviors
869.18 can also be geared towards
things like pets or food,
872.46 or anything that we find
we want to be closer to
875.11 and want more of.
876.17 Whereas the defensive circuits
involve areas of the brain,
879.87 yes, such as areas that
are involved in fear,
882.51 but also areas of the brain and body
884.92 that are literally
associated with freezing
886.89 or with backing up.
888.2 So the way to think about gratitude
889.91 is that falls under this
category of pro-social behaviors,
892.53 which are designed
893.363 to bring us closer to
different types of things,
896.75 and to enhance the level of detail
899.92 that we extract from those experiences.
902.34 Now, the existence of
these two neuro circuits
904.75 that I've placed on this sort
of a metaphorical seesaw,
908.57 if you will,
910.75 runs counter to a lot of
the messaging or the ideas
914.57 that were put forth in the last century
917.21 about the psychology of
happiness and gratitude,
920.98 versus the psychology of
depression and struggle
926.04 and concern about the future.
928.468 In fact, I'd like to read
a quote from the great,
930.41 and we really should call
him the great Sigmund Freud,
933.4 because despite having certain traits
937.85 that people criticize him of,
940.18 Freud was indeed a genius
942.07 about many aspects of psychology.
943.86 But I just want to read you
Freud's stance on happiness.
948.41 And this invokes elements
of gratitude as well.
951.11 And then you can gauge for yourself.
954.445 "Our possibilities of happiness
are already restricted
958.1 by our constitution."
959.65 So he's saying that we're basically wired
961.35 to not have happiness easily.
963.857 "Unhappiness is much less
difficult to experience.
966.39 We are threatened with
suffering from three directions;
968.93 one from our own body,
970.48 which is doomed to decay and disillusion,
972.797 and which cannot even do without pain
975.25 and anxiety as warning signals.
977.14 Two, from the external world,
978.98 which may rage against
us with overwhelming
981.08 and merciless forces of destruction.
983.08 And three and finally, from
our relations with others,
986.73 the suffering of which
from this last source
988.93 is perhaps more painful
to us than any other."
992.34 That's Sigmund Freud.
993.63 And not all of his writings
were pessimistic, if you will.
998.122 What Freud is referring to there
1000.018 are those defensive circuits.
1002.42 And of course, he talks about
psychological defensives.
1004.96 And in full disclosure, I am a huge fan
1008.12 of much of the psychological literature
1010.577 and psychoanalysis of Sigmund
Freud and his descendants,
1015.16 like Young and others.
1016.38 I think there are strong
elements of truth there.
1018.67 But he gives you a sense
of the kind of mindset
1020.64 of psychology early in the last century.
1023.444 And then of course, was the emergence
1025.23 of the positive psychology movement,
1026.93 which was really about
invoking the understanding
1030.167 and eventually the elucidation
of the neural circuits
1034.35 for things like happiness
and awe and affiliation
1037.44 and things that we are
calling pro-social circuits.
1040.07 So the field of psychology as
a dark and light, if you will,
1044.24 and the field of neuroscience
has a dark and light.
1047.31 We have these what we call
parallel pathways in the brain.
1050.35 And we have parallel pathways in the mind
1052.27 that set us up for
feeling good about things
1054.34 or for feeling less good about things.
1056.67 I think what's really salient
from the quote from Freud
1058.9 is that what he's saying is our default
1061.61 is to be concerned about the future,
1063.73 to be wrapped in our defenses,
1066.61 and to some extent that's true.
1068.215 And the reason we can say that's true
1070.71 is because most of us
need a gratitude practice.
1075.34 We need to do certain things
1076.84 in order to feel good and to feel happy.
1079.55 We actually have to put work into it.
1081.29 It is quite possible
that there's an asymmetry
1084.1 in the way that these pro-social
1085.74 versus defensive circuits are set up,
1088.12 such that because defensive circuits
1090.71 are designed to keep us safe,
1092.22 psychologically and physically safe,
1093.87 that they have more robustness,
1096.28 or they can actually drive
our behavior more easily.
1099.22 I'll give you an analogy in the system
1101.29 that I'm most familiar
with as a neuroscientist,
1103.34 which is the visual system.
1104.74 In the visual system, we
have parallel pathways.
1107.237 We have neurons in our eye that respond
1110.59 when things in our
environment get brighter.
1112.71 Literally when the lights go up,
1114.36 these neurons start firing like crazy.
1116.39 And we have neurons in our eye
1117.77 that respond when things get darker,
1119.59 when things start dimming
or go from white to black.
1123.178 The circuits for detecting
darkening are much more robust
1128.36 and much more numerous than are
the circuits for brightness.
1131.28 And that is probably related, probably,
1134.08 to the fact that dark objects
or experiencing looming,
1140.13 meaning incoming objects and
being able to perceive them
1143.64 is something that's vital to our survival.
1145.93 Whereas being able to perceive
the brightening of things
1148.86 might be important to
survival in certain contexts;
1151.2 a car lights coming at you at night
1152.43 or something of that sort,
1153.66 but not as often in a
kind of a evolutionary
1156.81 or ecological context as
the darkening of things.
1159.57 So, I think Freud's quote
and the field of psychology
1163.05 now point to the fact that indeed we have
1167.14 the capacity for happiness
and we have the capacity
1169.56 for great worry and concern
and depression and unhappiness.
1173.51 And the neural circuit
literature also supports that.
1176.96 The key thing for today's discussion
1179.01 is that gratitude turns out to be
1181.97 one of the most potent wedges
1183.82 by which we can insert our thinking,
1186.29 and as you also see, the
physiology of our body,
1189.5 between these two circuits,
1191.02 and give a little more
levity, if you will,
1194.17 to the side of the seesaw
1195.38 that's associated with
positive pro-social feelings.
1199.44 And if you keep imagining
this seesaw imagery,
1203.79 what's really beautiful
about gratitude practices
1206.31 is that if they're performed repeatedly,
1209.07 and not even that often, but repeatedly,
1211.67 then one can actually
shift their neural circuits
1214.86 such that the seesaw that
I'm calling pro-social
1217.54 versus defensive behaviors,
can actually start to tilt.
1220.25 And the little hinge, if you will,
1221.72 on the seesaw in the
middle can be adjusted
1223.76 in a little tighter when
the side for gratitude
1228.61 and for wellbeing and
for feelings of happiness
1231.39 is a little bit higher.
1232.85 What this means is that,
1234.245 whether or not Freud was right or wrong,
1235.94 whether or not the neuroscientists
1238.35 in one camp or another
were right or wrong,
1240.34 we now know with certainty that
a regular gratitude practice
1243.71 can shift the pro-social circuit
1245.69 so that they dominate our
physiology and our mindset
1249.35 in ways that can enhance
many, many aspects
1252.47 of our physical and
mental health by default.
1254.89 So we don't always have to
constantly be in practice
1257.37 trying to be happy.
1258.95 So the succinct way of saying all this is,
1261.306 yes, indeed, we might be wired
1263.49 or in such that we have
a greater propensity
1267.3 for unhappiness than happiness.
1269.29 But gratitude practices provided
they are the effective ones
1272.97 and they're performed regularly,
can shift those circuits,
1277.36 such that we are happier on average,
1279.8 even when we are not
performing those practices.
1282.28 Now I'd like to talk about
some of the neurochemistry
1284.587 and neural circuits
associated with gratitude
1287.62 and pro-social behaviors.
1289.71 Numerous times on this podcast,
1291.13 I've talked about
so-called neuromodulators.
1293.57 For those of you that might've forgotten
1295.28 or have never heard of
neuromodulators before,
1297.5 neuromodulators are chemicals
1298.81 that are released in the brain and body
1300.9 that change the activity
of other neural circuits.
1303.68 They make certain brain areas
more likely to be active
1306.87 and other brain areas
less likely to be active.
1310.6 These neuromodulators have
names like dopamine, serotonin,
1313.02 acetylcholine, epinephrin, and so on.
1316.19 The main neuromodulators
associated with gratitude
1319.01 and pro-social behaviors
tends to be serotonin.
1322.49 Serotonin is released
1323.89 from a very small collection
of neurons in the brainstem
1328.85 called the raphe, R-A-P-H-E,
the raphe nucleus,
1332.7 and a few other places in the brain.
1334.25 And the raphe neuron
send these little wires
1336.76 that we call axons out to
numerous places in the brain.
1340.08 And they tend to increase the activity
1342.19 of particular neurocircuits
that lend themselves
1345.91 to more approach to particular
types of experiences.
1350.88 That makes total sense
if you think about it.
1353.2 Have a chemical that under
certain circumstances
1356.08 is released in the brain,
1357.52 that triggers the activity
of neural circuits,
1360.6 that makes the organism, you,
1362.94 more likely to stay in an
interaction with something,
1366.46 or even lean in and seek a
more detailed interaction
1369.78 with that person, place or thing.
1372.311 Beautiful work from a
cognitive neuropsychologist.
1377.09 His name is Antonio Demasio.
1379.14 He's a world-class neuroscientists.
1382.44 Has been in the game a very long time.
1384.24 Has explored the so-called
neural correlates of gratitude.
1387.46 And two main brain areas are activated
1391.09 by these serotonergic systems.
1393.45 And when people experience something
1395.99 that makes them feel gratitude,
1398.49 even if it's shallow gratitude or deep,
1400.89 and if it's all the way to deep gratitude,
1402.99 they see activation of these
particular brain circuits
1405.62 I'll mention in a moment.
1406.55 And the amount of activation scales
1408.76 with how intensely the person experience
1411.63 the feeling of gratitude.
1413.54 And those two areas have particular names.
1415.5 You don't need to know the names,
1416.57 but for those of you that want to know,
1417.87 they are the anterior cingulate cortex
1419.96 and the medial prefrontal cortex.
1421.91 And of course, these
brain areas are connected
1423.38 to a number of other
networks in the brain.
1425.47 In fact, that's how they get you or others
1428.59 to lean into certain experiences.
1430.635 Because when these areas are active,
1433.44 certain thought processes get invoked.
1436.08 Those thought processes probably
resemble something like,
1439.02 hmm, I'd like to experience more of this,
1441.06 or hmm, this feels really good.
1442.52 And then they literally
feed onto your muscles
1446.62 via the neurons, making you
happy to stay stationary,
1450.9 if you're experiencing something you like,
1452.35 or to move closer to something
1454.14 that you find attractive to you literally.
1457.73 So these are powerful circuits.
1459.62 Of these two brain areas,
1460.95 the one I'd like to focus on the most
1462.76 is the medial prefrontal cortex.
1465.536 Many of you have probably heard
1466.84 of the medial prefrontal cortex,
1468.57 because this is the area of the brain
1470.429 that is involved in planning
and in deep thinking
1475.18 and evaluation of different
types of experiences,
1477.79 past, present, or future.
1479.523 It seems actually that
pretty much every study
1482.44 of human anything seems to involve
1484.4 the medial prefrontal cortex,
1485.7 or at least one could get that impression
1487.78 just by looking at scientific abstracts
1489.47 and papers these days.
1491.188 So I think it's worth us
taking a step back and asking,
1493.93 what is the medial prefrontal
cortex really do, right?
1497.26 How could this one piece
of neural real estate
1499.61 that we all have right
behind our forehead,
1501.76 how could that be involved
in so many different things?
1504.11 And the reason it can be involved
1505.59 in so many different things,
1506.62 and the reason it's especially
important for gratitude
1509.26 is that medial prefrontal
cortex sets context, okay?
1513.65 It sets context and it literally defines
1516.97 the meaning of your experience.
1519.34 Now this is not at all
an abstract phenomenon.
1521.69 I'm going to give a very
physiological example of this,
1525.442 and then we're going to
translate to gratitude.
1527.84 But I really want everyone to understand,
1529.89 how is it that medial prefrontal cortex
1532.21 sets the context of
everything in your life?
1535.79 Well, it does it the following way.
1537.51 You have a number of
circuits deeper in your brain
1540.46 that simply create some
sensations or they allow you,
1544.16 I should say, to perceive
certain sensations.
1546.61 Let's use the example of cold exposure,
1549.18 something that we'd sometimes
talk about in this podcast,
1551.18 for other reasons.
1552.542 If you were to deliberately
place yourself into an ice bath,
1557.25 it would be uncomfortable,
1558.68 even if you're adapted
to cold and so forth.
1562.474 The discomfort is non-negotiable.
1565.78 However, if you are doing
it because you want to,
1569.03 or because you have knowledge
1570.64 that there are particular health benefits,
1573.92 the medial prefrontal cortex
1577.33 can then control areas
of your deeper brain,
1579.98 like the hypothalamus,
to positively impact
1583.18 the neurochemicals that are
released into your system.
1585.48 You'll still get a lot of adrenaline
1587.17 by getting into the ice bath.
1588.84 But the fact that you are
doing this deliberately,
1591.93 and your knowledge that
you are making the choice,
1594.42 that it's you that's
deciding to put yourself
1596.43 through this discomfort,
1598.51 has been shown to create a very different
1601.89 and positive effect on
things like dopamine,
1605.29 on things like anti-inflammatory markers,
1608.23 in your immune system, et cetera,
1609.78 compared to if someone
pushes you into an ice bath,
1613.7 or if you are doing it
because someone insists
1616.43 that you do it and you
really, really don't want to.
1618.82 So there's a very subtle distinction here.
1620.83 It's just the distinction
of motivation and desire,
1624.97 or lack of motivation and
being forced into something.
1627.72 And there are a number
of other effects of this
1629.383 that have been described.
1630.85 In the episode with Robert Sapolsky
1633.24 that I did earlier this last year,
1635.29 he talked about a study in animals,
1637.27 which has also been shown in humans.
1638.64 If you take a mouse for instance,
1640.4 and it runs on a running wheel,
1642.03 which mice really like to do,
1643.83 there are many positive effects
on reducing blood pressure,
1646.45 improvements in neurochemistry,
et cetera, in that mouse.
1649.53 However, if there's a mouse
in the cage right next to it
1652.91 that's trapped in the running wheel
1654.24 and it has to run every
time the other mouse runs
1657.3 'cause the wheels are linked,
1658.68 well, then the second
mouse that's forced to do
1661.36 the exact same running
experiences negative shifts
1665.52 in their overall health metrics.
1666.71 Blood pressure goes up, stress
hormones go up, et cetera,
1669.34 because it's not actually
making the choice.
1671.54 Medial prefrontal cortex is the knob,
1674.7 or the switch rather, that
can take one experience
1678.75 and allow us to frame it
1681.12 such that it creates
positive health effects.
1684.02 And the exact same experience
1685.87 framed as something we don't want to do,
1688.17 or that we are forced to do
1689.58 can create negative health effects.
1691.66 Now how exactly the neurons
and medial prefrontal cortex
1694.51 do that is rather complicated,
1696.4 and frankly not completely understood.
1698.62 But it's somehow able to adjust
1700.68 the activity of other neural circuits
1702.21 that are purely reflexive.
1703.43 As we say, neuroscience, like
really dumb neural circuits,
1705.77 they're just like switches,
and place a context onto it.
1709.44 So, gratitude is a mindset
1714.22 that activates prefrontal cortex,
1717.81 and in doing so sets the
context of your experience
1721.44 such that you can derive
tremendous health benefits.
1724.64 Which leads us to the question;
1726.21 what kind of gratitude practice
1728.81 is going to accomplish this, right?
1730.69 Because it is not simply the
case that I could take a knife,
1733.13 don't please, don't do this experiment,
1734.42 and cut my hand and say, oh, you
know, I'm going to enjoy this.
1738.74 I'm doing this 'cause this is
good for me and it won't hurt.
1741.82 Of course it'll hurt,
1742.653 just like the ice bath
is cold, no matter what.
1745.141 But I can't lie to myself, right?
1748.56 If I have some knowledge that
cutting myself is bad for me,
1752.95 that's very hard to override.
1754.8 And so, the medial prefrontal cortex
1757.28 has a tremendous capacity to set context.
1759.968 And it does that beautifully
with respect to gratitude.
1763.29 But you can't simply lie to yourself.
1765.32 You can't simply say, oh,
well, every experience
1768.07 is a learning experience,
1769.47 or a terrible thing happens, oh, good,
1773.42 I'm just going to say good,
1774.86 and that your body will react
as if it's good for you.
1777.59 That's a myth.
1778.57 And frankly, it's a myth
that's fairly pervasive
1781.36 in the self-help and
self-actualization literature.
1785.01 We have the opportunity
to reframe and set context
1787.78 on our experiences.
1789.03 But that requires a very
specific set of practices.
1791.89 We can't simply lie to
ourselves or quote unquote,
1794.21 fake it until we make it.
1795.81 Neural circuitry is very
powerful and very plastic.
1798.47 It can be modified and it's
very context-dependent,
1801.67 but it's not stupid.
1802.83 And when you lie to yourself about whether
1805.36 or not an experience is
actually good for you or not,
1809.61 your brain knows.
1811.38 So what does an effective
gratitude practice look like?
1815.02 Well, let's examine what an ineffective,
1818.71 what a poor gratitude practice looks like.
1821.43 Because therein lies some
really important information,
1825.12 including the fact that I,
1826.69 and I think millions of
other people out there
1828.959 are doing it wrong.
1831.428 Most gratitude practices
that you see online
1834.3 and that people talk about
in various talks and so forth
1838.07 involves something like
writing down or reciting,
1842.42 or thinking about five or
10 or three or 20 things
1846.483 that you're especially grateful for.
1848.96 And then really trying to
feel into some of those,
1852.14 really try and think
deeply about the emotions,
1856.14 the sensations, the
perceptions that are associated
1859.32 with those particular people,
1860.65 places and things on your list.
1864.22 Most studies actually
point to the fact that
1868.53 that style of gratitude practice
1870.85 is not particularly effective in shifting
1873.7 your neural circuitry,
your neural chemistry,
1876.3 or your somatic circuitry,
the circuits in your body,
1879.51 'cause you literally have
organs and neural circuits
1881.45 that are connected,
1882.58 the circuits of your brain and body
1884.35 toward enhanced activation
of prefrontal cortex,
1888.34 enhanced activation of these
pro-social neural networks
1891.46 that we were talking about earlier.
1893.46 Now that may come as a
surprise to many of you,
1895.76 and certainly came as a surprise to me.
1899.15 There is some evidence
that if there's a shift
1902.42 in so-called autonomic arousal
1904.71 during these gratitude practices,
1906.98 these ones that I'm calling ineffective,
1909.14 that they can be made
slightly more effective.
1911.68 So what do I mean by a
shift in autonomic arousal?
1914.28 Well, very briefly we have a
aspect to our nervous system,
1918.06 both within our brain and body
1919.41 that we call the autonomic nervous system.
1921.86 It's a little bit of a misnomer
1922.693 because autonomic means automatic.
1924.69 And in fact, we can take control
1926.88 of the autonomic nervous system.
1928.36 It has one branch, meaning
one set of connections
1931.88 and circuits that are associated
with making us more alert,
1934.61 the so-called sympathetic nervous system,
1937.683 or I should say sympathetic arm
1939.52 of the autonomic nervous system,
1940.63 but that's really a mouthful.
1941.85 It's really associated with
enhanced alertness of any kind
1945.31 for excitement or fear,
1946.93 and it has nothing to do with sympathy.
1948.52 It's just about enhanced alertness.
1950.09 And then the other arm of
the autonomic nervous system
1952.97 is the so-called parasympathetic arm
1956.454 of the autonomic nervous system.
1957.287 But that's also a mouthful.
1958.28 So let's just say it's the calming aspect
1961.39 of the autonomic nervous system.
1962.81 So it's associated with
decreased heart rate,
1965.17 decreased breathing rate, et cetera.
1967.84 So we have these two aspects,
our autonomic nervous system,
1971.95 and it has been shown
that if people are brought
1974.8 into a state of heightened
sympathetic tone,
1978.39 meaning more alertness,
1980.55 then the intensity of the
emotions that they experience
1983.93 in their gratitude practice is enhanced,
1986.43 and the effectiveness of
that gratitude practice
1988.83 can be enhanced.
1990.64 This is seen nowadays somewhat
commonly as having people,
1995.05 for instance, cyclic
hyperventilated breathing,
1998.64 as we call it in my laboratory.
2000.64 Breathing that's very intense so that,
2002.093 inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale very deeply
2004.53 for 25 or 30 breaths.
2005.88 Then people will sit
in a meditative stance,
2007.76 or they'll focus on
their notepad and paper.
2011.41 And they'll write out the things
that they're grateful for.
2013.76 And then they'll really try
and feel into those things,
2015.98 or they'll think about those things.
2017.46 And it makes perfect sense
2018.87 as to why enhancing autonomic arousal
2021.136 toward more alertness would
create more robust feelings
2026.13 or more robust impact of
the gratitude practices,
2029.86 because in that state, you are more alert
2032.85 and therefore you are
able to bring more detail,
2035.07 more richness to the perception
and the understanding
2037.89 of what those things on
your list happened to be.
2040.93 And I should say
2042.55 that there are numerous
other approaches to this.
2045.3 Sort of self-help type stuff
2046.73 and self actualization seminars.
2048.54 People will do things like cold baths,
2050.61 or they'll do chanting,
2051.9 or they'll have any number
of different experiences
2054.51 all of which are mainly geared
2055.71 towards increased autonomic arousal.
2058.24 There even practices out there
2059.47 using pharmacology to create
increased autonomic arousal
2062.29 and then drop into gratitude.
2064.036 Across the board, those
increase the potency
2069.01 of the gratitude practice of
listing things out on paper
2071.77 or in one's mind or saying them out loud.
2074.5 But somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,
2077.98 that form of just expressing
thanks, expressing gratitude
2083.05 is not the most effective way
2084.9 to shift these pro-social circuits
2087.17 in positive ways for one's physiology
2090.14 and anatomy and psychology.
2093.327 It turns out that the most
potent form of gratitude practice
2097.31 is not a gratitude practice
where you give gratitude
2101.16 or express gratitude,
2102.49 but rather where you receive gratitude,
2105.43 where you receive thanks.
2107.07 And this to me was very surprising.
2109.32 There are a number of
studies about this now.
2111.54 One in particular that I
think is interesting is called
2114.0 Prefrontal activation while listening
2115.79 to a letter of gratitude read aloud
2117.61 by a coworker face-to-face: A NIRS study.
2120.583 N-I-R-S.
2121.416 I'll explain what all this means.
2122.6 You now know what the
prefrontal activation part is.
2125.29 This is activation in
the prefrontal cortex.
2127.54 The NIRS, N-I-R-S study,
that's just a technical term.
2131.74 It's a form of imaging brain activity.
2135.46 It's noninvasive.
2136.53 So it's kind of a skullcap.
2138.69 It looks like a hoodie
2140.14 with a bunch of wires
coming out of it basically,
2142.2 that can measure neural activity
2143.75 without having to remove
any parts of the skull
2146.1 or put a person into one of
these two black fMRI machines,
2149.51 which is very invasive.
2150.79 It's also a wonderful tool
because it allows human subjects
2154.44 in the laboratory to move around
2156.83 and to engage with one another.
2158.42 So in this particular
experiment, what they did
2161.25 is they had co-workers
write a letter of gratitude,
2165.53 of thanks to another coworker,
2168.64 unbeknownst to the other coworker.
2170.11 And then they sat down together
2172.07 and then they imaged brain activity
2173.57 as this letter was being read
2175.01 and as the letter was
being heard, received.
2177.37 And it showed very robust effects
2180.7 on these prefrontal networks;
2182.72 that pointed to the fact
that receiving gratitude
2185.68 is actually much more potent,
2187.53 in terms of the positive
shifts that that can create
2189.71 than giving gratitude.
2191.49 So this raises a couple
of important points.
2193.24 First of all, if you are
somebody who is prone
2196.53 to write letters of gratitude,
2198.95 ideally I think it's requisite
2201.66 that these be genuine
letters of gratitude,
2203.5 or saying things that are
genuine expressions of gratitude.
2208.73 This could be by text or
in-person or by phone.
2212.203 You have within you a very potent form
2214.99 of shifting somebody else's neurology.
2217.34 Now, that's wonderful,
2218.94 and I think there are many
people like that out there.
2221.7 But for many people who want to experience
2224.97 the positive effects of gratitude,
2226.653 it's probably not the
most advantageous approach
2231.04 to just sit around waiting,
2232.07 hoping that someone's going to deliver
2233.7 all these letters or words of gratitude.
2236.15 How is it that you can create
2237.81 that sense of receiving
gratitude for yourself
2240.28 and thereby derive the
effects of gratitude
2243.17 as outlined in this particular study?
2244.97 And there we go back to the important work
2247.21 of the great Antonio Damasio
2249.41 who explored these neural
correlates of gratitude,
2252.06 to define the areas of the brain
2253.59 that are associated with
pro-social behaviors
2255.41 like the prefrontal cortex.
2257.075 And what's really
interesting about the work
2260.32 that Demasio and colleagues
did is first of all,
2262.89 they used functional
magnetic resonance imaging.
2265.53 So this is a very high resolution approach
2268.61 to exploring what areas
of the brain are active.
2271.41 And has very high, what we
call temporal resolution,
2273.82 meaning you can see things
in time at very fine scales.
2277.28 So a lot of mechanistic detail,
2280.09 it can emerge from these sorts of studies.
2282.06 What they did was interesting.
2283.617 Rather than have people express gratitude,
2287.67 they had the subjects go into the scanner,
2290.7 so their brains are being imaged,
2292.22 and they watched narratives,
stories about other people
2298.16 experiencing positive
things in their life.
2302.05 And in this case, these
were powerful stories.
2304.65 These were stories about
survivors of genocide.
2307.26 So that's what they're watching.
2308.56 The subjects were subjects
2309.83 that were not survivors of genocide.
2312.2 So they were watching these videotapes
2314.26 of people that had genocide,
2316.93 and had people help them along the way
2320.92 as part of their story of survival,
2323.23 either psychological and/or...
2324.74 Obviously they survive long
enough to make the video.
2327.14 So, or physical survival.
2329.17 So within these stories,
2330.89 there was a conveyance
of a lot of struggle.
2334.66 These people talked about
the horrible situations
2336.7 they were in, but also
small, but highly significant
2341.729 features of their history that had led
2344.1 to their own feelings of gratitude.
2346.33 So for instance, it says a woman at the...
2349.41 This is literally from
the scientific paper.
2352.05 Somebody had been sick for weeks.
2354.08 So the woman's describing how
she'd been sick for weeks.
2356.95 And then another prisoner who was a doctor
2361.43 finds a particular medicine somehow,
2363.49 it doesn't describe how, and
literally saves her life.
2366.58 Or an ally who was also
in a stricken circumstance
2371.96 gave this person a pair of glasses
2374.5 when their eyesight started to falter.
2376.9 So these sorts of stories.
2378.12 Now just hearing this in the context
2380.17 of nothing but a scientific
paper and discussion,
2382.23 these probably aren't that impactful.
2384.37 What's really important about this study
2386.28 and is really important
for all of us to know
2388.33 is that these stories of
other people receiving things
2392.04 that were powerful for them
in their life trajectory
2394.44 is embedded in story.
2396.67 And the human brain especially
is so oriented towards story.
2402.6 We have neural circuits
that like to link together
2406.04 past, present future,
have different characters,
2408.87 protagonists and antagonists.
2410.72 From the time we're very young
2411.85 until the time we're very old,
2412.87 story is one of the major ways
2415.24 that we organize information in the brain.
2417.03 There does seem to be storytelling
2419.66 and story listening circuits in the brain.
2422.36 So what's important is not simply
2424.162 that these people survived genocide.
2426.53 That's obviously important and wonderful.
2429.19 But it's not just that they
were helped along the way,
2431.84 it's that the description of their help
2433.74 is embedded in a larger story.
2435.83 So the human subject in
this scientific study
2438.74 is watching these powerful stories.
2441.21 And the neural circuits associated
with pro-social behaviors
2444.78 and with gratitude become robustly active
2448.36 when they start to feel some affiliation
2451.474 with the person telling the story.
2453.16 They start to feel some resonance.
2454.72 We might call that empathy,
2456.69 but it doesn't necessarily
have to be empathy.
2458.87 Empathy is a somewhat
complicated thing to define
2461.94 because it involves
literally a setting aside
2464.89 of one's own emotions and
really focusing almost entirely,
2468.56 or experiencing almost entirely
the emotions of another.
2471.5 It could be sympathy, it could be empathy.
2473.78 What we do know is that
the stories themselves
2477.04 were able to shift the
physiology of the subjects
2479.67 in this study and activate these,
2481.9 what we're calling gratitude circuitry
2483.98 that involves the prefrontal cortex.
2485.97 So if you think about the earlier study
2488.02 that receiving gratitude
is the most powerful way
2490.49 to activate these circuits for gratitude,
2494.0 the subjects in this study in many ways
2495.87 are receiving a sense of gratitude,
2499.77 but through the narrative of
one of these other subjects.
2503.36 Which I find fascinating.
2504.85 I would have thought a
great gratitude practice
2507.535 is when you sit down and list out
2509.105 all the things you're grateful for.
2509.938 That just seems so logical to me.
2511.22 But it turns out
2512.1 that these neurocircuits
don't work that way.
2513.65 That to really activate
these circuits for gratitude
2516.51 in the serotonin and that probably
2518.02 the oxytocin system as well,
and its prefrontal networks,
2521.092 one has to powerfully
associate with the idea
2524.69 of receiving help, okay?
2527.13 The subjects are associating
2530.65 or experiencing empathy or sympathy
2532.78 for somebody else who received help.
2534.83 In the other study we
described a few minutes ago,
2537.21 the person hearing the letter
was receiving gratitude,
2540.26 and that would amplify the
activity of these circuits.
2543.07 And that takes us to a larger theme of,
2546.48 what are these pro-social circuits?
2548.48 And an important concept
to emerge from this
2551.41 is one that's most often associated
2553.77 with the autism literature, frankly,
2555.91 which is this idea of theory of mind.
2558.24 So just very briefly, theory of mind
2560.32 is the ability to attribute or
to understand the experience
2564.59 of another without actually experiencing
2567.61 the thing that they're experiencing.
2569.03 Again, it kind of sounds like empathy,
2570.76 but this was actually a term
that's now been demonstrated
2576.06 in the psychology and neuroscience,
2577.56 that's been linked to
some very robust findings
2581.04 associated with brain areas and so forth,
2583.17 that was looking at autistic
kids and non-autistic kids.
2587.75 The person largely responsible
for developing theory of mind
2590.69 is Simon Baron-Cohen.
2592.61 I believe he's either the
brother or the cousin.
2594.85 I can't remember recall which,
2596.08 to the comedian Sasha Baron-Cohen.
2598.29 Simon Baron-Cohen is a
professor at Oxford University,
2601.14 or at least he was the
last time I checked.
2603.16 And the theory of mind
test can be done on adults
2607.54 or on children.
2608.92 And we can sort of do
that experiment right now,
2610.83 if you like, and you can think
about how you would behave
2612.91 if you were a subject in
a theory of mind test.
2616.48 Theory of mind test
involves you or a child
2618.61 or some other adults,
2619.52 sitting down and watching a video
2622.2 of a child going into a room
or a person going into a room,
2625.08 opening up a desk or a
dresser, a drawer for instance,
2628.47 or a desk drawer and
placing something in it,
2630.9 like a pen or a toy, and then leaving.
2633.72 And then another person
walking into the room
2636.8 and clearly looking for
something in the room,
2640.5 and one presumes it's the toy or the pen,
2642.31 depending on the context.
2644.208 People who have strong theory of mind
2646.69 make the obvious conclusion
that the person looking around
2651.45 for the pen or the toy is
confused, or they're perplexed.
2656.84 They don't know where the toy is,
2658.2 they're looking for the toy.
2659.48 Someone who is fairly far
to one side of the autism
2664.09 or Asperger's spectrum will simply focus
2668.24 on the location of the object,
2669.81 on the location of the pen or the toy.
2672.72 And this is especially true in children.
2674.3 They will say, well, it's
in the second drawer,
2676.09 it's in the second drawer.
2676.923 And they'll say, well, how does the person
2678.75 who comes into the room feel?
2679.71 And they'll say, well, it's in the drawer.
2681.26 So they tend to focus on the
specific factual elements
2685.34 of the scenario rather
than place their mind
2688.35 into the mind of the other person.
2690.51 So-called theory of mind.
2691.97 Now that doesn't mean
that people with autism
2694.28 and Asperger's don't have empathy.
2696.23 In some cases they can.
2697.76 It sort of depends on where
they are in the spectrum
2699.76 and so forth.
2700.65 But theory of mind has very strong basis
2704.59 in these prefrontal cortex neural circuits
2706.9 that we were talking about.
2707.82 Because, as you now know,
2709.75 the prefrontal cortex sets context
2712.58 on what we see and experience.
2714.1 And the theory of mind task
2715.56 that I just described very
briefly is a pure example
2720.69 of context setting, right?
2723.2 It's not about just the factual elements
2725.73 about the location of the
objects, it's about the context.
2729.16 Someone is looking for something
2730.46 that someone else put someplace
2732.01 that makes it such that
that object is hidden.
2735.12 So basically theory of
mind is your ability
2737.24 to put yourself into
the mindset of another.
2739.087 And in order to get activation
of these gratitude circuits,
2744.42 one needs to put themselves
into the mindset of another
2747.82 or to directly receive gratitude.
2750.12 So let's just take a moment
and start to think about
2752.62 how we are going to build out
2754.05 the ultimate gratitude practice;
2755.94 meaning the most effective
gratitude practice
2758.08 for us to do because of all
the many positive effects
2762.07 that an effective gratitude
practice can have,
2764.72 if it's the proper one.
2768.2 It's very clear that receiving
gratitude is powerful,
2771.39 but it's also very clear
that waiting around
2773.55 to receive that gratitude
is an impractical approach.
2776.39 Now, there are methods
that have been developed
2779.54 by my colleague at Stanford,
Kelly McGonigal and others
2783.83 that actually have developed
things for the workplace,
2786.32 for school, for coworkers and students
2788.41 to write out particular
worksheets related to
2792.53 what they're thankful for
from others and exchange them.
2794.397 And so those are very useful practices.
2796.23 I don't want to take anything
away from the important work
2798.56 that Kelly and others have done.
2800.56 But in the absence of having other people
2802.99 to do these practices with,
2804.557 what we know for sure
2806.56 is that there has to be a real experience
2810.62 of somebody else's experience.
2813.2 And that the best way to do that is story.
2816.49 So, in thinking about how to build out
2818.87 an effective gratitude practice,
2821.02 it's very worthwhile, I believe,
2822.66 to find someone's narrative
that's powerful for you.
2828.067 And many ways to think about this is,
2829.858 it's got to be a story that inspires you
2833.79 because of the, for
lack of a better phrase,
2836.81 the beauty of the human spirit,
2838.68 or the ability of humans
to help other humans.
2841.9 And I find this remarkable
because what this really means
2845.47 is that the circuits for gratitude
2848.12 are such that we can exchange gratitude.
2852.37 We can actually observe
someone else getting help,
2855.31 someone else giving help.
2856.8 And that observation
2858.78 of our species doing that for one another,
2861.841 allows us to experience the
feeling of a genuine chemical
2866.94 and neural circuit
activation lift, if you will.
2870.57 Very, very different
than simply writing out
2873.47 the things that you're
thankful for, right?
2875.71 And so, how would you do this?
2877.85 Well, people digest story in
a number of different ways.
2881.05 People watch movies,
people listen to podcasts,
2883.91 people read books.
2885.02 There are a tremendous
number of stories out there.
2887.903 It's clear that an
effective gratitude practice
2890.86 has to be repeated from time to time.
2893.3 So what I would not suggest
is that we build a protocol
2896.65 in which you're constantly foraging
2898.42 for inspirational stories
over and over again.
2901.18 Social media and the internet
are replete with those.
2903.874 That's not going to be a
very potent protocol or tool,
2907.24 because the most potent
protocol or tool for gratitude
2909.86 is going to be one that you
repeat over and over again.
2913.055 Rather, the most
effective protocol or tool
2916.35 is going to be either to think into,
2920.84 and you could write this out if you like,
2922.41 but think into when somebody was thankful
2925.4 for something that you did,
2927.09 and really start to
think about how you felt
2929.62 in receiving that gratitude,
2932.513 and/or I should say, imagining
or thinking about deeply
2938.06 the emotional experience of
somebody else receiving help.
2942.563 Now, what narrative you select
2945.22 is going to be very dependent
on you and your taste.
2947.98 It's going to be very dependent
on what resonates with you.
2950.89 But again, I want to
emphasize that the story
2954.21 that you select does not
have to have any semblance
2957.11 to your own life experience,
2958.74 is just about what happens to move you.
2961.02 And so, the way that one could do this,
2963.96 and actually I've started
this practice for myself
2966.23 on the basis of the learnings
I've had in the last few weeks
2969.38 around preparing for this episode,
2971.32 is to find a story that's
particularly meaningful for you.
2974.08 And then to just take some short notes,
2976.69 bullet point notes about
maybe list out for instance,
2980.58 on just a small sheet of
paper or in your phone,
2983.64 if that's your preference,
just list out for instance,
2986.36 you know, what the struggle was,
2990.01 what the help was,
2991.75 and something about how that
impacts you emotionally, okay?
2996.07 This is something just for you.
2997.14 You don't have to share it with anybody.
2999.41 That kind of shorthand
list of bullet point notes
3002.98 serves as your shorthand
for getting into this mode
3006.2 that we're calling gratitude.
3007.35 And actually closely mimics
a lot of what was done
3010.63 in these various studies.
3011.8 Because even though the studies
3012.79 I've talked about up until now,
3014.44 were really focused on what
we call acute imaging studies,
3018.0 where someone watched a
story or received gratitude
3021.34 while the experiment was done,
3022.89 and then that's it one and done.
3024.192 There are other studies looking
at gratitude in this context
3027.77 over many weeks, up to six weeks.
3029.5 And what one observes
3031.44 is that there's so-called
neuroplasticity of these circuits.
3034.58 Neuroplasticity is the brain
and nervous system's ability
3036.82 to change in response to experience.
3038.59 And that these neural
circuits start developing
3041.57 a familiarity with the narrative.
3043.55 So that, for instance,
3044.74 let's say you sit down the
first time you've found a story
3047.36 that you find particularly compelling.
3049.14 You've written down a few notes
3051.18 about what that story
is just to remind you.
3053.699 And then you read those out
3055.23 and you think into the
richness of that experience,
3058.11 that receiving of gratitude,
3059.42 or if you prefer you're doing the protocol
3061.38 where you're thinking about
when someone was deeply grateful
3064.15 or was genuinely grateful to you,
3065.963 that you're thinking about that.
3067.49 The neural circuits become
activated more easily
3070.06 with each subsequent
repeat of the practice.
3072.44 Now this can be done
literally for one minute
3075.41 or two minutes or three minutes.
3077.7 This is not an extensively long practice.
3080.11 And that's another beauty
of gratitude practices,
3082.73 is that they have these
out-sized positive effects
3085.54 on so many aspects of our physiology,
3087.6 but these are very short practices.
3089.5 They're the kind of thing that you can do
3090.62 walking to your car.
3091.84 The kind of thing you can
just sit down for a minute
3093.35 and set a timer and do,
3095.3 because they are really
3096.133 about changing your
state of mind and body.
3098.49 And if you have an experience
of receiving gratitude
3101.51 or a story that's very potent for you,
3103.538 it becomes a sort of shortcut
into the gratitude network,
3107.31 these pro-social networks.
3109.01 Meaning the activation of these circuits
3110.57 becomes almost instantaneous.
3112.28 And that's very different
3113.28 than a lot of other practices out there.
3115.45 I'm not aware of any meditation
practices for instance,
3117.92 that you can do only a few times,
3120.051 and then within a week or so,
3123.69 you just have to do them for one minute.
3124.95 You immediately drop into
the kind of optimal state
3127.71 that that meditation practice
is designed to create.
3130.16 There are some shorter
meditation practices
3131.84 that are very potent and
very effective like that.
3134.06 But gratitude and the
circuits associated with it
3136.75 appear to be especially plastic;
3138.65 meaning, especially prone to
being able to be triggered,
3143.25 in the good sense of the word triggered,
3144.9 just by simply reminding yourself
3146.81 of this particular narrative.
3148.41 Now there's another very
clear and positive effect
3150.8 of using this narrative
or story-based approach
3153.87 to a gratitude practice.
3155.53 And that's what story
does for our physiology.
3160.26 Now, earlier in the episode,
3161.5 I mentioned this really incredible study
3163.87 in which listening to a story
coordinated the heart rates
3169.23 of different individuals,
3171.43 and literally changed the way
that their heart was beating.
3175.02 The title of the study
is conscious processing
3178.62 of narrative stimulate synchronizes
3180.64 heart rate between individuals.
3182.01 The first author is Perez,
again, published in Cell Reports,
3186.03 Cell Press journal, excellent journal.
3188.13 And it's a really elegant study.
3189.81 They looked at instantaneous heart rate.
3191.37 They use electrocardiogram to do that,
3193.05 which is simply a way
to look at heart beats
3195.45 with very fine precision.
3197.56 They also looked at the
breathing of subjects
3199.7 as they listened to the stories.
3201.74 Some of you may know that
breathing and heart rate
3204.51 are actually linked to one another
3205.83 in a really interesting way.
3207.34 The simple way to put it
is that when you inhale,
3210.06 your heart rate speeds up a little bit,
3212.1 and when you exhale, your
heart rate slows down.
3214.85 And this is because of the
movement of the diaphragm
3218.27 in your thoracic cavity.
3220.61 And the physicians and medical types
3223.1 call this respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
3225.364 There's a mechanism
there we could get into,
3227.33 but I don't want to distract
us from the main theme here.
3229.67 So just remember when you inhale,
your heart rate speeds up,
3232.18 and when you exhale, your
heart rate slows down.
3234.53 They looked at breathing,
they looked at heart rates
3236.48 in different individuals.
3237.93 And listening to a story
3241.55 produced very consistent
gaps between the heart rates
3246.61 of the people who are listening,
3248.18 different individuals in the study
3250.5 who were not located in the same place
3253.26 when they listened to the story,
3255.13 listening to the story on different times,
3257.25 different days entirely had
very similar heartbeat patterns
3262.14 listening to the story.
3263.91 What this means for
your gratitude practice
3265.86 is that having a story
that you can return to
3269.76 over and over again, even if
it's not the entire story,
3272.53 you're just using the
shorthand bullet point
3274.87 version of your story,
will create a perceptible
3278.83 and real shift in your
heartbeat and in your breathing.
3283.35 And actually that's been
demonstrated over and over now
3286.12 that an effective
gratitude practice is one
3288.55 that can rapidly shift,
3289.85 not just the activation of
these circuits in your brain
3292.76 for pro-social behaviors,
3294.36 but also activation of
particular circuits in your heart
3300.54 and in your lungs and the
other organs of your body,
3302.81 such that you can get
into a reproducible state
3306.36 of gratitude each time.
3308.66 So an important component here is that,
3311.26 there be some element of story,
3313.24 again, you don't have to listen to or read
3315.15 or think about the entire
story, start to finish
3317.32 in order to extract these benefits,
3318.95 and that it be the same
story over and over.
3322.55 And as a consequence, that's
going to shift your physiology
3325.33 into presumably a more relaxed state,
3327.85 because typically that's the one
3328.98 that's associated with gratitude.
3330.97 Although activation of
these gratitude circuits
3334.01 has also been shown to create
sense of awe or sense of joy.
3338.39 There are few studies looking at
3339.89 and kind of parsing the difference
3341.58 between gratitude and joy.
3343.49 I was able to find a
few studies about that.
3346.06 But in general, the neural
circuits that are activated
3349.64 tend to overlap quite a lot with those
3352.095 that create a sense of gratitude.
3354.35 So we don't want to split
hairs on necessarily there.
3356.75 The key thing is that you
want to use the same story,
3359.89 even if it's your own
experience or somebody else's,
3362.23 and keep coming back to
it over and over again.
3364.31 That makes it a very potent tool
3365.98 that you can get a tremendous
amount of benefit from
3368.94 with even as short as
60 seconds of practice.
3372.66 Earlier, I talked about how
you can't lie to yourself
3376.21 and say, you know, I'm so
grateful for this thing
3379.09 that I actually hate.
3380.64 And in a moment, I'm going to tell you
3383.11 about some scientific data that proves
3385.29 the statement I made is true,
3388.21 and that you can't just lie to yourself
3390.85 and derive the benefits
of a gratitude practice.
3393.97 The data are also going
to point to the fact that,
3396.36 if you are giving gratitude,
not just receiving it,
3399.64 but giving gratitude, that
too has to be genuine.
3403.04 There's a really interesting studies
3404.85 published in scientific reports,
3406.49 which is a nature research journal.
3408.67 The title of it is Neural
Responses to Intention
3411.81 and Benefit Appraisal are Critical
3413.87 in Distinguishing Gratitude and Joy.
3415.91 It's a somewhat complicated study,
3417.84 so I'm just going to hit
on some of the high points.
3419.54 But basically what they did
3420.78 is they use functional
magnetic resonance imaging.
3423.15 So they could look at
brain circuitry activation
3426.56 with very high precision.
3428.46 And they had people receiving money
3431.57 in the context of this experiment.
3435.32 And they had some knowledge
as to whether or not
3438.49 the money that they were receiving
3440.03 was given to them
wholeheartedly or reluctantly.
3443.4 And there were a number of
different variables in the study,
3445.41 including how much money was given.
3446.96 So in some cases it was very little,
3448.31 in other cases, it was modest,
3449.52 in other cases, it was a lot more.
3451.76 And they also varied the extent
3453.69 to which the giver of the
money, called the benefactor,
3457.26 was doing it wholeheartedly
3458.69 or seem to be doing it
somewhat reluctantly.
3461.1 And they looked at whether
or not the sense of gratitude
3465.3 scaled with the amount of money received
3469.37 and/or the intention of the benefactor.
3473.17 Whether or not the person giving the money
3474.69 was doing it wholeheartedly
or reluctantly.
3477.09 And what's remarkable
3478.4 is that while the amount of money given
3481.78 was a strong component in
whether or not somebody felt
3486.528 that they had received
gratitude, which makes sense,
3490.21 you know, the amount
of money is some metric
3493.48 of whether or not somebody feels thanked.
3497.04 The stronger variable, the
bigger impact came from
3500.52 whether or not the person giving the money
3502.9 was giving it with a
wholehearted intention
3506.1 and not a reluctant intention.
3508.33 And of course, there was an interaction
3510.08 where the best circumstance of course,
3511.88 is where the person
received a lot of money
3514.06 from somebody who wholeheartedly
3515.55 wanted to give them a lot of money.
3516.88 And they did every derivation of this.
3518.41 But this is of important.
3520.14 This tells us many things
3522.27 that extend way beyond
gratitude practices,
3524.85 which is that, genuine
thanks are what count.
3529.61 Okay?
3530.443 We could probably presume that.
3532.27 But receiving genuine thanks
is also a strong variable
3536.83 in determining whether or not
we experience real gratitude,
3541.01 or whether or not it's empty,
3543.01 regardless of the size of a gift.
3545.15 So this constrains our
gratitude practices somewhat,
3548.49 but I think in an interesting
and important way,
3551.089 you can't make this stuff up.
3553.47 You can't tell yourself
that an experience was great
3555.79 or that I got a lot of money
and therefore it justified it,
3560.6 even though I think that they
give it to me reluctantly,
3563.13 or my boss hates me, but
they gave me a raise.
3565.83 That stuff stings for
all the right reasons,
3568.5 because there are circuits
in our brain and body
3571.27 that are oriented towards
these pro-social interactions.
3574.57 And in some sense, what we
are looking for as a species,
3577.28 what these circuits want, if you will,
3579.63 is to receive things from people
3582.02 that are giving them wholeheartedly.
3583.86 And that tells us that
if we are the giver,
3586.93 that we better be giving wholeheartedly,
3589.0 or we are undermining
the sense of gratitude
3591.68 that someone is going to receive from us.
3593.81 So we are gradually building up
3595.6 the ultimate gratitude practice
3598.05 based on the variety of
scientific literature
3601.03 that's out there.
3602.38 And I know that many people
are probably interested
3604.99 in developing a gratitude
practice that has long lasting,
3608.12 maybe even permanent positive effects
3609.84 on their neural circuitry.
3611.38 So with that in mind, I
want to turn our attention
3614.77 to a really interesting study.
3616.722 It's entitled effects
of gratitude meditation
3619.569 on neural network functional connectivity
3622.1 and brain heart coupling.
3624.14 And to make a long story
short and a lot simpler
3627.32 than that title,
3628.97 repeated gratitude practice
3631.78 changes the way that
your brain circuits work.
3634.68 And it also changes the
way in which your heart
3637.71 and your brain interact.
3639.98 You're familiar with the fact
3641.424 that your brain controls your heart
3642.257 because you could be
stressed about something
3643.27 that's perceived with your brain,
3644.63 and then your heart rate will speed up.
3646.56 You're probably also
familiar with the fact
3647.98 that if your heart rate speeds up
3649.39 for some reason or no reason,
3650.86 you're probably thinking,
3651.693 well, what's making my
heart rate speed up?
3652.687 And that's because the brain and the heart
3654.83 are reciprocally innervated, as we say.
3658.02 They're talking to one
another in both directions.
3659.96 It's a two way highway.
3661.806 This study looked at changes
3663.8 in so-called functional
connectivity within the brain
3667.43 and between the brain and the heart,
3669.63 in response to gratitude practices.
3672.31 And as a control they used,
3673.98 what I think is very interesting,
a resentment intervention.
3676.93 I think resentment is an apt control
3680.91 and quite different than gratitude.
3683.12 To make a long story
short, what they found
3684.77 is that a repeated gratitude practice
3687.03 could change the resting
state functional connectivity
3690.91 in emotion and
motivation-related brain regions.
3694.36 If I haven't mentioned a
strong enough incentive
3696.47 for doing a regular
gratitude practice until now,
3699.63 this is definitely the
one to pay attention to.
3702.64 Because what they found was
a regular gratitude practice
3706.27 could shift the functional
conductivity of emotion pathways
3710.07 in ways that made
anxiety and fear circuits
3713.37 less likely to be active,
3714.91 and circuits for feelings of wellbeing,
3717.65 but also motivation to
be much more active.
3721.46 I find that remarkable and important
3723.18 because a number of people struggle
3725.1 with issues of motivation.
3726.3 A lot of people who are highly motivated
3728.53 also have issues with anxiety and fear.
3730.75 And so this study really
points to the fact
3733.37 that it's a twofer.
3734.37 If you have a good gratitude practice
3736.07 and you repeat it regularly,
3737.94 you reduce the fear, anxiety circuits,
3740.81 you increase the efficacy
of the positive emotion,
3746.02 feel good circuits,
3746.98 and the circuits associated
with motivation and pursuit
3749.84 are actually enhanced as well.
3751.57 So that's very strong incentive
to have a gratitude practice
3755.627 and one that you use regularly.
3756.97 We'll talk about how
regularly in just a moment.
3760.62 I don't want to go into too
many details of the study,
3762.401 although we will put a
reference to it if you like.
3764.48 It includes a lot of fMRI data,
3767.01 imaging data of different brain areas,
3768.52 many, many tables and examples of matrices
3770.77 of before and after gratitude,
after resentment, et cetera,
3774.86 you do indeed have circuits
in your brain for resentment,
3777.21 whether you like it or not, we all do.
3780.14 And some people,
3781.31 just those circuits are
more robust than others.
3783.54 But the remarkable thing is
one can shift these circuits
3786.73 in the direction that I
think most people would like;
3789.44 which is more sense of
wellbeing and motivation
3791.63 and less resentment and fear literally.
3794.84 And what's really cool
about this study also
3797.23 is that the interventions
are only five minutes long.
3801.82 It's incredible, five minutes long.
3804.46 And so, as we start to build out
3806.8 our ideal gratitude practice,
3809.32 we know that it has to
have certain features.
3811.25 First of all, it has to
be grounded in a story,
3814.28 probably a story that you've heard
3815.73 in its entirety at least once.
3817.45 But then you can have a shorthand version,
3819.93 the so-called bullet points
that I talked about before
3822.03 that allow you to drop into that story
3824.79 or the emotional
associations with that story.
3826.93 So you don't have to listen
to the whole story each time.
3829.52 And that story should be one
3830.353 in which you are genuinely
being thanked for something
3833.43 and it made you feel good,
3834.78 or it could be a story about
3836.4 someone else genuinely
expressing thanks, okay?
3839.65 Based on the description
of the gratitude practices
3843.3 that we talked about earlier.
3845.78 Your gratitude practice can be very brief.
3848.35 I mean, it be as brief as
one minute, 60 seconds,
3851.35 or five minutes, which still
seems very brief to me.
3853.89 Although in these studies,
3855.12 they were getting these
really major effects
3857.34 just from five minutes
of gratitude practice.
3860.42 Some of these papers involve
people doing some focusing
3865.57 on their breathing and calming themselves
3868.32 as they go into the gratitude practice,
3870.01 but that's within the five minute block.
3872.06 So if you decide that you're going to do
3873.83 a gratitude practice
that involves first doing
3877.8 some calming breathing,
3878.8 exhale emphasized breathing, for instance,
3880.71 or physiological size, things
I've talked about before
3882.84 on this podcast that can help calm me down
3884.52 'cause they have a lot of
exhales, which you now know,
3887.551 slows your heart rate down,
3889.121 and then doing your gratitude
practice, that's fine.
3890.85 It's actually not necessary,
3892.3 but a lot of these studies used that.
3894.85 I think once a narrative has been set,
3897.73 you've heard the story and
it has meaning for you,
3899.79 or you have a recollection of a story
3901.74 where you are genuinely thanked,
3903.26 then I think just 60
seconds or maybe 120 seconds
3907.97 should be sufficient.
3909.19 Then the question becomes,
3910.023 how often to repeat
this gratitude practice.
3913.153 That's not exactly clear
from the existing literature.
3917.29 I can't point to any one study
that says five times a week
3919.81 or four times a week.
3920.643 So I'm going to throw out a number
3922.143 which is three times a week,
and then people will ask,
3926.26 well, when should I do
that gratitude practice?
3928.47 And I'll tell you what I tell everybody
3931.64 about almost every practice
with a few exceptions,
3934.0 which is the best time of
day to do this practice
3936.93 is when you first wake up in the morning,
3939.007 or before you go to sleep at
night, or any time of day.
3942.94 So we've talked about some
of the neurocircuitry changes
3945.46 associated with a regular
gratitude practice.
3948.37 And I should mention
3949.3 that there's an additional
neurocircuitry shift that occurs.
3952.786 It relates to a structure that I mentioned
3955.09 just briefly earlier,
3956.06 which is the so-called ACC
or anterior cingulate cortex.
3959.54 This is an area of the brain
that has several functions,
3962.05 but more and more data
are pointing to the fact
3964.01 that the ACC is actually
involved in empathy
3967.57 and is involved in understanding
the emotional states
3970.73 of others in general,
3971.78 even if it doesn't evoke
a sense of empathy.
3973.94 And there are several studies
that point to the fact
3977.04 that in humans who have a
regular gratitude practice,
3979.8 the ACC becomes more robustly engaged,
3982.93 even with these very
brief gratitude practices.
3985.44 We actually have a project in our lab.
3987.809 This is actually done in animal models,
3990.35 where animals observe other animals
3993.43 experiencing certain emotional states.
3997.25 And one of the brain areas
that we've identified
3999.56 as important for this;
4001.38 it's kind of a primordial form of empathy
4003.63 'cause we really don't know
what these mice are thinking.
4006.5 We work on humans, in the
case where we work on humans,
4009.21 of course we ask them and they tell us
4011.05 what they think they're thinking.
4012.652 With the mice, we ask them,
4014.29 but they don't tell us much
of anything interesting.
4016.05 Instead we measure a number
of physiological signals.
4018.65 But the important point is that the ACC,
4021.16 the anterior cingulate cortex
seems to be an important hub
4024.7 for the generation and
execution of empathy
4029.15 as it relates to feelings
and empathic behaviors;
4031.79 altruistic behaviors of
animals helping animals
4034.45 and humans helping other humans.
4036.42 We see this in the animal
models, we see this in humans.
4038.98 So, if you want to be
a more empathic person,
4041.86 a gratitude practice
4042.83 is also going to be very
effective for that, it appears,
4046.65 especially using this
narrative type approach
4049.06 where you are using
someone else's narrative
4051.35 of receiving gratitude
4053.27 as a way to tap into your
own sense of gratitude.
4056.34 Thus far, we've mainly talked
about the effects of gratitude
4058.95 on neural circuit activation,
4060.517 and changes a little bit
about some of the changes
4063.35 that are happening in terms of the body,
4064.82 heart rate and breathing and so forth.
4066.45 But we haven't talked a
lot yet about the changes
4070.07 in health metrics, in
things like inflammation
4073.33 or reductions in inflammation and immunity
4076.53 and things of that sort.
4077.89 So with that in mind, I'd
like to describe the results
4080.17 of a really interesting recent
study that was published
4082.59 in the journal Brain
Behavior and Immunity.
4084.75 This was published 2021.
4086.05 The title of the study is,
4088.09 Exploring Neural Mechanisms
of the Health Benefits
4090.47 of Gratitude in Women: A
Randomized Control Trial.
4093.2 The first author is Hazlitt.
4095.38 And basically, what this paper showed
4097.984 was that women who had a
regular gratitude practice
4103.57 of the sort that we've been
talking about up until now,
4106.32 showed reductions in amygdala activity;
4109.883 a brain area associated
with threat detection,
4112.33 a intimate part of the
fear network in the brain.
4114.79 So reductions in amygdala activation,
4118.2 and large reductions in the production
4122.81 of something called TNF-alpha,
tumor necrosis factor alpha,
4126.15 and IL-6, interleukin six.
4128.5 Now, if you happen to have
listened to the episode
4130.43 that I did on activating
your immune system
4132.995 and immune function, you heard
about TNF-alpha and IL-6.
4137.53 TNF-alpha and IL six are
inflammatory cytokines.
4141.15 These are chemicals
that exist in your body,
4143.87 and that are released from
cells when there is damage
4148.82 or kind of a systemic stress;
when your system is in duress.
4153.17 And in the short-term,
they can be beneficial.
4155.19 They can call in signals for wound healing
4156.977 and repair of cells, et cetera,
4159.18 but you don't want TNF-alpha
and IL-6 levels to be too high,
4162.95 and you don't want those
levels to be up for too long.
4166.26 And so, this study is really nice
4168.12 because they showed significant effects
4170.02 in reducing TNF-alpha and IL-6
4172.87 in response to a gratitude practice.
4176.24 And because they also observed reductions
4178.62 in amygdala activation,
4180.809 this area associated with
threat detection and fear,
4183.796 it's likely, and I
should emphasize likely,
4187.3 'cause I don't know,
4188.42 that the direction of the effect
4189.81 is that there are neural circuit changes,
4191.29 which in turn shift the degree
4194.15 to which these inflammatory cytokines
4195.89 are released in the body.
4196.76 Although for all I know, it
could be the other way too.
4199.66 It could be that having
a gratitude practice
4202.07 shifts something about
heart rate and breathing,
4203.92 which in turn lowers the
amount of TNF-alpha and IL-6,
4207.817 and that in turn reduces
activation of the amygdala.
4210.53 We don't really know the direction
of the effect, excuse me,
4213.48 but if I had to speculate,
I would speculate
4215.43 that it was a shift in neural circuitry
4217.36 that led to a change in
the circuits of the body.
4221.01 And another interesting
aspect of this study
4223.04 is that the reductions
in amygdala activation
4225.97 and the reductions in TNF-alpha
and IL-6 were very rapid.
4229.8 They occurred almost immediately
4231.98 after the gratitude
practice was completed.
4235.03 And even though that study was performed
4236.67 exclusively on female subjects,
4238.674 based on the biology and
circuitry of the amygdala
4241.96 and the biology of TNF-alpha and IL-6
4245.33 performing this inflammatory
role in both men and women,
4249.42 I don't see any reason
4250.29 why the results of that
study wouldn't pertain
4252.45 to both men and women.
4254.24 So what about the chemistry
associated with gratitude?
4257.06 Are there certain chemicals in our brain
4258.47 or that we could enhance in our brain
4260.61 that would enhance our gratitude practice?
4263.95 Indeed, there are.
4264.93 And earlier I mentioned the chemical,
4267.17 the neuromodulator serotonin
as having a powerful influence
4271.01 on the activation of neural circuits
4272.54 associated pro-social
behaviors and gratitude,
4275.52 and other sort of feel good behaviors.
4278.244 To make a long story short,
4280.12 neuromodulators like
dopamine and epinephrine
4282.84 and norepinephrine tend
to place us into a state
4285.86 of external perception,
4287.96 meaning a state of observing
things and focusing on things
4291.41 outside the immediate reach of our body
4294.2 and confines of our skin.
4295.26 They tend to put us in pursuit,
4297.23 or in thinking about
things out in the future
4299.77 or out away from our physical body.
4303.16 Whereas the neuromodulators serotonin
4305.33 and some of the associated
pathways like oxytocin
4308.55 and other neurochemicals
tend to, I want to emphasize,
4312.01 tend to be associated with
states that are about contentment
4316.33 with what we have within
the confines of our body
4318.89 and our immediate experience.
4320.49 So they're not so much about pursuit,
4322.1 but about gratitude and about appreciation
4324.76 for what we already have.
4327.391 I'd be remiss if I didn't
therefore point out
4331.13 that if one were to shift their chemistry
4334.54 toward having higher levels of serotonin,
4337.13 you would, by all logic,
4339.99 experience heightened levels of gratitude.
4342.29 And indeed some people do this.
4343.61 They will take compounds
that increase serotonin.
4345.86 There are a number of compounds
out there, as you know.
4348.04 I'm certainly not
suggesting people do that.
4349.91 A couple of the supplement based legal,
4352.3 over-the-counter approaches to this
4354.229 are things like 5-HTP, which
is a precursor to serotonin.
4359.57 Some people will take 5-HTP
4361.15 to try and enhance their sleep.
4362.55 I'm not a fan of doing that, personally.
4365.137 I've talked about this
in the sleep episodes.
4367.27 But the state that we call
sleep has a very complex
4372.29 and important architecture as
it relates to neurochemicals.
4375.7 And by taking serotonin by supplement
4378.22 or by stimulating serotonin
release by supplement
4380.54 with 5-HTP or with tryptophan,
4382.6 which is an amino acid
precursor to serotonin,
4385.97 one can run into the problem
4387.4 of disrupting the normal
architecture of sleep cycles
4390.36 throughout the night.
4391.193 I experienced that as, if I've
taken 5-HTP or tryptophan,
4394.18 I fall asleep very deeply,
4395.37 but then I wake up three hours later
4396.98 and I can't fall asleep at all.
4398.56 And actually it sometimes
even messes up my sleep
4400.54 the subsequent night.
4401.83 Some people are not so
sensitive to 5-HTP in tryptophan
4404.53 and they actually really like it.
4405.59 So again, you have to talk to your doctor,
4407.61 decide what's right for you.
4408.63 You're responsible for
your health, not me.
4410.42 And you have to determine
what works for you.
4411.97 Everyone's slightly individual.
4413.53 But one could imagine enhancing
their amount of serotonin
4418.84 in their brain and body by
taking 5-HTP or tryptophan
4422.71 before a gratitude practice,
4424.02 that seems a little bit extreme
4425.35 given that the gratitude
practice is only about a minute
4427.44 to five minutes long on a regular basis,
4429.22 but there may be instances
4430.77 in which you're really trying
to amplify the circuitry
4433.42 in the brain and body that
are associated with gratitude,
4436.0 and therefore that might be something
4437.39 that you want to explore.
4439.01 There's a new compound that's out there.
4441.21 A legal over-the-counter compound.
4444.06 At least it's legal in the United States,
4446.23 I don't know about overseas.
4447.51 And that's a compound
called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A.
4452.84 It's an interesting compound.
4454.24 It goes by another name as well, which is,
4457.46 and I'm going to mispronounce
this and I apologize,
4459.25 this is Sceletium tortuosum.
4462.16 Please see our timestamps
4463.68 if you want to see the spelling of that.
4465.345 But I'll just call it Kanna,
by its other name for short.
4469.36 It's an herb that is traditionally chewed
4473.55 prior to stressing endeavors,
4475.36 is how it's described on an examine.com.
4477.33 But I looked at some
of the studies on this.
4478.91 It's kind of interesting.
4479.743 It very likely increases the
amount of serotonin in the body
4483.26 and pretty potently.
4484.641 It is generally taken in dosages
4488.07 of anywhere from 25 to 50 milligrams.
4490.084 And it creates a kind of a
pro-social gratitude enhancing,
4496.61 or I should say gratitude circuitry
4498.87 pro-social neurocircuitry enhancing effect
4503.13 because of the ways that it interacts
4505.22 with the certain urgent
pathways of the brain.
4508.38 So it also has another name,
4510.28 it's sometimes called
Zembrin, Z-E-M-B-R-I-N.
4513.9 Again, I'm not suggesting
that people run out
4515.57 and take this stuff.
4516.49 But there is an emerging practice
4519.294 of people using Zembrine,
Sceletium tortuosum,
4523.42 also called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A,
4526.383 in order to enhance the
states that are about comfort
4531.23 and pleasure with what one has
4533.59 in their immediate sphere of experience.
4536.08 And so one could imagine
4537.722 if it's safe for you and right for you
4539.68 and legal where you live
in enhancing serotonin
4544.32 by taking Kanna and then
doing your gratitude practice.
4547.459 What's the logic behind that?
4549.23 Well, oftentimes we hear about
4552.84 supplements and pharmacology
for "increasing plasticity"
4556.53 or "opening plasticity."
4557.86 You know, if I had a dollar
for every time someone said,
4559.91 I hear that such and
such opens plasticity.
4562.84 Well, indeed there are molecules
4564.59 associated with the thing
that we call neuroplasticity.
4567.23 But neuroplasticity is not
an event, it's a process;
4570.86 meaning it has many, many steps.
4572.45 It occurs during wakefulness,
4573.74 it's consolidated during
sleep and so forth.
4576.588 Taking a substance that increases
4579.13 a neurochemical in your brain will likely,
4582.72 provided it's the right substance
4584.36 and it's the right practice,
4586.56 will likely enhance the
amplitude or the intensity
4590.2 of that practice and make
it a more potent form
4593.3 of inducing neuroplasticity.
4594.57 Meaning it will create longer lasting
4597.5 or more robust brain changes
4599.5 than if one hadn't increased
their chemistry in this way,
4603.47 this way of taking something.
4605.59 But that doesn't necessarily mean
4606.84 that you couldn't get to the
very same place without it,
4608.99 by simply doing a slightly
longer attitude practice
4612.08 or putting a little bit
more mental effort into it.
4614.75 That said, I think the
future of neuroplasticity
4619.0 really resides in not just one approach,
4621.58 not just neurochemistry
and taking substances
4624.32 to increase neuroplasticity,
4625.8 not just behavioral practices
4627.5 to try and increase neuro-plasticity,
4629.086 not just brain machine interfaces
4631.278 or devices to increase neuro-plasticity,
4634.53 but rather the convergence
of multiple tools.
4637.31 So you could imagine enhancing
serotonergic transmission,
4640.79 as we say in the brain
4641.91 using something like Kanna,
4643.01 combined with a gratitude practice.
4645.3 In the not-too-distant future,
4646.6 this will probably also be combined
4647.96 with some sort of noninvasive device
4650.41 to stimulate the prefrontal
cortex at the same time.
4653.01 Please don't do that recreationally.
4654.35 Those devices are for
clinical use only currently.
4656.685 But I think you start to get the idea.
4659.61 So for those of you that are
a little bit more exploratory
4661.94 and you want to go in and
do some reading on this,
4664.14 I thought you might
find Kanna interesting.
4666.17 I certainly did.
4667.11 There are a number of studies
that will pop up on PubMed.
4669.14 I recommend using examine.com
as your jumping off point.
4672.784 There are some decent studies
4674.7 that they described in their
so-called human effect matrix.
4677.14 So those are studies done on humans.
4678.77 And the main effects
that have been documented
4681.16 in the scientific literature are minor,
4683.95 but significant increases in
cognition, executive function.
4687.21 Executive function is something
4688.39 that's also associated
with prefrontal cortex,
4690.55 and reductions in anxiety.
4692.1 And that seems to be a common theme
4693.67 that we're seeing again and again.
4695.39 You saw this in the study,
4696.814 the trial where we saw
reductions in TNF-alpha
4700.15 and reductions amygdala activation.
4702.9 Which would ostensibly lead
to reductions in anxiety.
4706.97 You're seeing increases in
activity in brain networks
4709.82 that are associated with
feelings of wellbeing.
4711.5 So again, back to that kind of push-pull
4713.9 of defensive anxiety and
fear-like circuitry in the brain
4717.23 being antagonistic, as we say,
4719.88 to the circuits that are
associated with pro-social,
4722.0 feeling good, receiving good feelings,
4724.53 type circuitry and events in life.
4727.09 So as you now know,
there is a lot of science
4729.38 about how gratitude can positively impact
4732.01 neural circuits in the brain.
4733.376 Anti-inflammatory markers in the body,
4736.11 brain-heart breathing
coordination, and on and on and on.
4740.305 I'd like to just
highlight the key elements
4743.26 of the most effective,
at least to my knowledge,
4746.1 gratitude practice.
4747.57 And when I say the most effective,
4749.16 what I'm doing is I'm gleaning
from the scientific studies
4751.9 I was able to find and
combining the various findings
4755.23 of those studies into what
I think is a very practical,
4758.73 and what should certainly
be a very effective
4761.44 gratitude practice
4762.5 for all the positive
effects that we described.
4765.18 First of all, that gratitude practice
4767.65 has to be grounded in a
narrative, meaning a story.
4771.36 You don't have to recite
or hear that story
4773.89 every single time you do
the gratitude practice,
4777.03 but you have to know what that story was
4779.24 and what the gratitude
practice references back to.
4782.97 Second of all, that story can be one
4785.83 of you receiving genuine thanks.
4790.09 And the key elements there
4791.41 are that you are the one
receiving the thanks,
4793.55 the gratitude,
4794.57 and that it's being given to
you genuinely, wholeheartedly.
4800.87 Or it can be a story of
you observing someone else
4805.48 receiving thanks or expressing thanks.
4808.87 And that has to be a
genuine interaction as well,
4811.75 both between the giver and the receiver.
4815.68 So, those are the first three elements.
4818.42 What I recommend would be
after you've established
4821.64 the story that you want to use
for your gratitude practice,
4824.96 that you write down three
or four simple bullet points
4828.15 that can serve as salient
reminders of that story for you,
4831.82 it will serve as kind
of a cue for that story
4834.25 without having to listen to,
or talk out the entire story.
4839.24 I would recommend writing down something
4841.47 about the state that you
or the other person were in
4844.76 before they received the gratitude,
4847.06 the state that you were in
or that the person was in
4850.11 after they received the gratitude,
4852.03 and any other elements
4854.01 that lend some sort of emotional weight
4856.13 or tone to the story.
4857.42 This could be three pages
of text, if you like,
4859.89 or it could just be a
couple of bullet points.
4862.32 I don't think it really matters.
4863.39 The important thing is that
it's embedded in your memory
4865.49 and that it's really associated
4866.62 with this genuine exchange of thanks,
4869.375 and the receival of things.
4870.94 I think those are the key elements.
4872.68 And then it's very simple:
4873.64 The entire practice involves
reading off these bullet points
4877.56 as a cue to your nervous system
of the sense of gratitude.
4882.81 And then for about one minute,
4885.31 which is a trivial amount of time
4886.85 if you really think about
it, or maybe two minutes,
4889.61 or if you're really
ambitious up to five minutes
4891.69 of just really feeling into
that genuine experience
4895.42 of having received gratitude
4896.81 or observed someone else
receiving gratitude.
4900.99 And then in terms of frequency,
I think a good rule of thumb
4904.86 would be to do that
about three times a week.
4907.36 And the time of day doesn't really matter.
4909.81 I can't see why there would be
4911.36 any so-called circadian effects of this.
4913.19 I know some people like
to do a gratitude practice
4915.05 before they go to sleep at night.
4916.76 I don't see any problem with doing this
4918.53 before you go to sleep at night.
4919.53 I also don't see any
problem with you doing this
4921.37 on your lunch break or mid-morning
4923.39 or first thing in the morning.
4924.45 I can't see any logic for
placing it at any one time of day
4928.45 and not another.
4929.69 So I think the most important thing
4930.72 is that you do it at
least three times a week.
4933.45 And as mentioned before,
it's very, very brief.
4935.78 So there are very few barriers
to entry for doing this.
4939.38 So if we just take a step
back from this protocol
4941.97 and compare it to what's
typically out there
4944.18 in the literature, which is,
4946.178 make a list of all the
things you're thankful for,
4948.43 recite in your mind all the
things you're thankful for,
4951.04 count your blessings.
4951.873 So I think everybody should
be counting their blessings
4953.61 all the time.
4954.443 There's always something
to be thankful for.
4955.92 But in terms of a scientifically
grounded gratitude practice
4960.37 that has also scientifically demonstrated
4963.09 to shift your physiology at
the level of your immune system
4967.03 and your look neurocircuitry,
4968.54 reducing anxiety, increasing motivation,
4971.08 all these wonderful
things that so many of us
4972.927 are chasing all the time as goals,
4975.89 I think a gratitude
practice reveals itself
4978.42 to be an immensely powerful tool
4981.02 for any and all of us to use.
4982.8 And that should come as no surprise
4984.53 because these pro-social
circuits for gratitude
4986.994 are not a recent phenomenon.
4989.78 Discussions about gratitude
date back hundreds,
4992.51 if not thousands of years.
4994.09 What we've done today is
to take the modern science
4996.2 right up until 2021,
4998.55 and to really distill from
that the neuroimaging data,
5001.46 the neurochemistry, the various aspects
5003.82 of brain-body connectivity,
look at the protocols,
5006.6 take various subject groups.
5007.98 Some were done in women,
5008.92 some were done between two individuals,
5010.74 some were done with brain imaging,
5011.82 all the various changes on a theme
5016.562 that allow us to point to a simple,
5019.73 but very effective protocol
that certainly we could all use
5022.96 around Thanksgiving.
5024.1 But Thanksgiving is just, but one day
5027.47 throughout the entire year, of course.
5029.44 I personally have been
using a gratitude protocol
5031.89 for the last several years.
5033.78 But that protocol was based
on my ignorance, really,
5037.27 about the scientific literature,
5038.817 and was mainly based
5040.75 on what I'd heard out
there in the internet,
5043.01 which is that I should
list out or think about,
5046.03 or verbally recite the
things that I'm grateful for.
5049.7 The sort of protocol
that we arrived at today
5052.73 based on the scientific literature
5054.5 is distinctly different from that.
5056.47 And as a consequence,
I've started to script out
5059.2 a protocol identical to
the one I just described,
5062.73 and I intend to use that going forward.

5094.44 During today's episode, and
in many previous episodes,
5096.9 I mentioned supplements.
5098.09 Supplements aren't for everybody.
5099.33 But if you are going to use supplements,
5100.94 it's imperative that the supplements
5102.42 be of the very highest quality.
5103.96 For that reason we've
partnered with Thorne,
5105.95 that's T-H-O-R-N-E,
5107.44 because Thorne supplements
5108.82 have the highest levels of stringency,
5110.75 in terms of the quality of
the ingredients they include
5113.47 and the precision of the
amounts of the ingredients
5115.65 they include in their products.
5117.63 They've partnered with
every major sports team,
5119.45 as well as the Mayo Clinic,
5120.54 so we're delighted to be
partnered with them as well.
5122.69 If you want to see the
supplements that I take,
5124.33 you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
5129.03 and there you can see all
the supplements that I take,
5131.44 and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements.
5134.08 Or if you navigate into the
site through that portal,
5137.08 thorne.com/u/huberman,
5140.17 you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements
5142.93 that Thorne makes.
5144.2 Thank you for your time
and attention today,
5145.99 learning about the science of gratitude.
5148.18 And last, but certainly not least,
5150.12 thank you for your interest in science.
