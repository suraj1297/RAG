0.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the Huberman Lab podcast,
2.25 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
5.7 [MUSIC PLAYING]
9.16 I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor
11.05 of neurobiology
and ophthalmology
13.18 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.89 Today, my guest is
Dr. Chris Palmer.
17.32 Dr. Chris Palmer
is a medical doctor
19.33 specializing in psychiatry
at Harvard Medical School.
22.48 He is the world expert
in the relationship
24.88 between metabolic disorders
and psychiatric disorders.
28.287 He treats a variety of
different conditions,
30.12 including psychosis, including
schizophrenia, as well
33.31 as attention deficit
hyperactivity
35.11 disorder, obsessive compulsive
disorder, anxiety disorders,
38.9 and depression among others.
41.21 He is best known
for understanding
42.97 the relationship
between how metabolism
45.41 and these various disorders
of the mind interact.
47.98 And indeed, today,
he describes not
50.02 only his own fascinating journey
into the field of psychiatry
53.38 but also his clinical
and research experience
56.47 using diet that is
different forms of nutrition
59.59 in order to treat various
psychiatric disorders.
62.45 He describes some
remarkable case studies
65.14 of individuals and
groups of people
67.39 who have achieved tremendous
relief from the types
70.24 of psychiatric
disorders that I just
71.98 mentioned a few moments ago, as
well as new and emerging themes
76.33 as to how metabolism
and the mind
78.4 interact to control
things like obesity.
81.04 Indeed, he raises the
hypothesis that perhaps obesity,
84.34 in many cases, is the
consequence of a brain
86.98 dysfunction as opposed
to the consequence
89.275 of a metabolic dysfunction
that then impacts the brain.
92.41 During today's episode,
he shares with us
94.87 his overriding hypotheses
about the critical roles
97.93 that mitochondrial function
and dysfunction play
101.38 in mental health
and mental illness,
103.33 and how various particular
types of diets--
106.15 ranging from the
ketogenic diet to modified
108.76 ketogenic diet and
even just slight
110.8 adjustments in
carbohydrate intake--
112.63 can be used in order to
change mitochondrial function
116.23 and bring relief for various
psychiatric illnesses.
119.38 He also highlights the
essential and important theme
122.44 that various diet interventions,
including the ketogenic diet,
126.52 were not first developed
for sake of weight loss
129.009 but rather were
developed as treatments
131.2 for neurologic conditions,
such as epilepsy.
133.51 Today, he shares
with us how the foods
135.31 that we eat alone and in
combination, and how fasting--
139.15 both intermittent fasting
and more lengthy fasts--
142.24 can interact with the way
that our brain functions
144.85 to strongly control the way
that we think, feel, and behave.
148.69 What's wonderful is that
Dr. Palmer not only explains
151.24 the science and his
clinical expertise,
153.2 but also points to various
actionable measures
155.56 that people can take in order
to improve their mental health.
158.83 I'd like to mention
that Dr. Palmer is also
160.81 the author of a
terrific new book.
162.64 The title is Brain Energy:
A Revolutionary Breakthrough
165.88 in Understanding Mental
Health and Improving
167.8 Treatment for Anxiety,
Depression, OCD, PTSD and More.
172.57 I've read the book, and
it is a terrific read.
175.12 I came away from this book with
a much evolved understanding
178.96 of how the various psychiatric
disorders that I just
181.36 described, as well as
ADHD, emerge in people.
184.48 And it has completely
revised my understanding
186.82 about the possible origins of
various psychiatric disorders
189.7 and the best ways to
treat them, including
192.04 both with medications but also
with nutritional approaches.
196.06 If you'd like to learn
more about Dr. Palmer's
197.98 work and the book, please
go to chrispalmermd.com.
202.21 We also provide
links to the book
203.95 and to his website in
our show note captions.
206.26 Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize
208.06 that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research
210.52 roles at Stanford.
211.72 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
213.76 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
216.22 and science-related tools
for the general public.
218.86 In keeping with
that theme, I'd like
220.36 to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.
222.8 Our first sponsor is Thesis.
224.95 Thesis makes custom nootropics.
227.14 And as I've said many times
before on this podcast,
229.96 I am not a fan of
the word "nootropics"
232.21 because it means smart drugs.
234.16 And frankly, there are no
specific neural circuits
236.83 in the brain or body for
being, quote unquote, "smart."
239.83 Thesis understands this.
241.36 And they've developed
custom nootropics
243.37 that are designed
to bring your brain
244.93 and body into the state
that's ideal for what
247.18 you need to accomplish.
248.812 They use the highest
quality ingredients,
250.52 things like
phosphatidylserine, alpha GPC,
253.005 many ingredients
that I've talked
254.38 about before on this podcast
and that I happen to use myself.
257.529 I've been using Thesis
for over a year now.
259.39 And I can confidently
say that their nootropics
261.348 have been a game changer.
262.66 For me, I like their
nootropic for clarity.
265.63 I use that before
cognitive work often.
267.85 And I like their
nootropic for energy,
269.987 and I often use that
before workouts--
271.57 in particular, workouts
that are especially intense.
274.905 To get your own personalized
nootropic starter kit,
277.03 go online to

290.5 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
293.44 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress
covers with cooling, heating,
296.2 and sleep tracking capacity.
298.21 I've talked many
times on this podcast
300.16 about the critical relationship
between sleep and body
302.83 temperature.
303.82 That is, in order to fall
asleep and stay deeply asleep
306.94 throughout the night,
our body temperature
308.69 needs to drop by
about 1 to 3 degrees.
311.06 And conversely, when we
wake up in the morning,
313.73 that is, in large part,
because of our body heating up
317.03 by 1 to 3 degrees.
318.637 Now, people have different
core body temperatures.
320.72 And they tend to run colder or
hotter throughout the night.
323.24 Eight Sleep allows you
to adjust the temperature
325.263 of your sleeping
environment so that you
326.93 have the optimal temperature
that gets you the best night's
329.48 sleep.
330.02 I started sleeping on
an Eight Sleep mattress
331.895 cover about eight months
ago, and it has completely
334.37 transformed my sleep.
335.51 I sleep so much deeper.
337.34 I wake up far less during the
middle of the night, if at all.
340.23 And I wake up feeling far
better than I ever have even
343.28 after the same amount of sleep.

354.345 Eight Sleep currently
ships in the USA,
355.97 Canada, United Kingdom,
select countries in the EU,
359.09 and Australia.
360.29 Again, that's
eightsleep.com/huberman.
362.96 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
365.42 ROKA makes eyeglasses
and sunglasses
367.67 that are of the absolute
highest quality.
369.8 The company was founded by
two All-American swimmers
371.99 from Stanford.
372.89 And everything about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses
375.41 were designed with
performance in mind.
377.45 I've spent a lifetime working on
the biology, the visual system.
380.37 And I can tell you that
your visual system has
381.86 to contend with an enormous
number of challenges in order
384.38 for you to see clearly--
385.4 for instance, when you move from
a sunny area to a shady area
388.01 and back again, whether or not
you're looking at something up
390.17 close or often to the distance.
391.73 ROKA understands the
biology of the visual system
394.19 and has designed their
eyeglasses and sunglasses
396.38 accordingly so that you always
see with perfect clarity.
399.17 ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses were initially
401.33 designed for activities
such as running and cycling.
404.577 And indeed, they are
very lightweight.
406.16 Most of the time I
can't even remember
407.57 that they're on my face.
408.5 They're so lightweight.
409.458 But the important thing to
know about ROKA eyeglasses
411.68 and sunglasses is
that while they
413.33 can be used during
sports activities,
415.82 they also have a
terrific aesthetic.
417.89 And they can be used just as
well for wearing to work or out
421.49 to dinner, et cetera.
422.69 If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses,

435.95 And now, for my discussion
with Dr. Chris Palmer.
439.34 Chris, Dr. Palmer, thank
you for being here.
441.562 CHRIS PALMER: Thank you,
Andrew, for having me.
443.52 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have a
lot of questions for you.
445.68 And I'm really excited
about this topic
447.305 because I think most people
know what mental illness is--
450.98 or they have some
idea what that is.
452.51 Most people have some
idea what nutrition is.
455.39 Fewer people certainly
know how closely
459.515 those things can interact.
462.45 And I think everybody is
familiar with the feeling
466.37 of a food or the
ingestion of a food
468.68 making them feel good
in the short term.
471.203 When we eat a food that
tastes delicious to us
473.12 or that we associate
with something nice,
475.31 then we feel good
mentally and physically.
478.1 Whereas, when we eat
something that gives us
480.267 food poisoning or maybe even
something that just doesn't
482.6 taste that great or
that we associate
484.25 with a bad experience, we feel
less good in the short term.
487.83 But I believe that very
few people understand
492.21 or are familiar with
the fact that nutrition
496.08 and our mental health interact
in this very intimate, maybe
500.55 even causal, way and that
is something that occurs
504.38 over long periods of time.
505.79 Meaning, what I ate yesterday
or the day before, maybe
508.31 even 10 years ago, could
be impacting the way
511.37 that my brain and body
are making me feel now.
514.26 So if you would, I'd love
for you to just tell us
516.679 about a little bit
of the history,
519.02 in particular, your
history with exploring
521.419 the relationship between
nutrition and mental health.
524.6 And then we can dive into
some of the more particulars
528.14 of ketogenic diets
versus other diets,
530.63 and some of the truly
miraculous findings
533.9 that you and others
are coming up
536.6 with based on real patients
and real experiences of people
541.43 who suffer and then find relief
by altering their nutrition.
544.793 CHRIS PALMER: Sure.
548.69 This story really starts
with my own personal story.
551.88 And I don't need to
go into great detail.
556.31 But to set the stage,
when I was a kid,
560.16 I definitely had mental
illness, started with OCD.
565.31 A series of events
happened in my family.
567.48 My mother had a horrible
kind of psychotic break,
571.76 and all sorts of adverse
childhood events for me.
575.96 She and I were actually
homeless together for a while.
580.64 I went on to have subsequent
depression, suicidality,
584.99 all sorts of things.
586.88 But somehow or another, I
pulled myself together and got
590.755 through medical
school-- actually
592.13 did quite well in
medical school,
594.05 got an award for being
one of the top students,
597.74 and then was doing my internship
and residency at Harvard.
604.47 And at that point in
time, I was diagnosed
607.615 with metabolic syndrome.
610.43 So I had high blood
pressure, horrible lipids,
614.38 and pre-diabetes.
615.97 And I was doing everything
right supposedly.
618.73 I was on a low-fat diet, and
I was exercising regularly.
623.38 And year after
year, my doctor kept
625.18 telling me diet and exercise.
627.53 I kept asking him, what diet?
628.93 What exercise?
630.49 I was doing everything
he kept telling me to do.
633.37 Everything was getting worse.
634.6 My blood pressure
kept going higher.
638.89 And at some point,
he kind of said,
641.44 you're going to have
to go on medication.
643.942 I need to put you on something
for your pre-diabetes,
646.15 something for your cholesterol,
and something for your blood
648.65 pressure.
649.64 So three pills out of the gate.
651.91 And I'm like, I'm
only in my 20s.
653.38 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Were you overweight?
654.4 CHRIS PALMER: No.
655.39 Technically, no.
656.62 I had a gut, so that's a sign of
insulin resistance, I know now.
662.8 I didn't know it then.
667.5 And he actually kind of leaned
in at one point and said,
670.785 do your parents have diabetes?
674.16 Yeah.
674.82 Do your parents have
high blood pressure?
676.528 Yeah.
677.853 Are your parents overweight?
679.02 Yeah.
680.19 Oh, I'm really
sorry, it's genetic.
683.88 Basically, you're screwed.
685.35 It's your genes.
686.58 You're just going to have to
bite the bullet and take meds.
690.42 And as a physician, I
knew what that meant.
693.88 I knew that I'm in my
20s, if I'm already
696.78 on three meds for
metabolic syndrome,
699.48 I'm going to be screwed
by the time I'm 40 or 50.
702.032 And I'm probably going to
be having heart attacks.
706.86 And I'd heard through
the rumor mill
709.35 that the Atkins
diet could somehow
713.13 help people improve their
cholesterol in pre-diabetes.
718.62 I actually didn't
really believe it.
720.13 I was highly skeptical.
721.44 And I believed everything I
was taught in medical school.
725.67 Why would my
professors lie to me?
727.62 They knew what they
were talking about.
729.3 Low-fat diet was
the thing to do.
731.88 And the Atkins diet was
clearly dangerous and reckless.
736.95 But I had been trying the
medical dogma for years,
740.34 and it wasn't working for me.
742.59 And so for whatever
reason, I decided
744.69 this is going to be my last
attempt at something different.
749.22 And then I'll just bite
the bullet and go on meds.
752.79 So I tried the Atkins diet.
755.76 I did my own special
version of it.
757.65 I still avoided red meat because
I was terrified of red meat.
762.155 I tried to do a healthy
version, which it's probably
765.45 more like the South Beach diet.
767.73 This was before the South
Beach Diet was invented.
770.22 But within three months,
my metabolic syndrome
773.94 was completely gone.
775.72 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So blood
pressure normalized,
778.23 lipids normalized.
779.67 Did your weight change?
780.975 You mentioned that you
were of healthy weight
782.85 but that you had a
bit of abdominal--
784.62 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
785.37 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --fat.
786.0 CHRIS PALMER: I lost
the abdominal fat.
787.71 I probably lost about 10
pounds through this process.
792.93 But everything got normal.
795.31 And when I went back to
my doctor, he was shocked.
797.7 He actually said, what
the hell are you doing?
799.68 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
During the time before
801.305 you switched to this new diet,
how was your mental health,
804.603 if you don't mind me asking?
805.77 Because it sound like
you're very clear that there
808.41 was metabolic
syndrome or you were
810.24 headed towards more
severe metabolic syndrome.
812.25 You mentioned OCD.
814.02 I actually am
familiar with this.
815.61 As a kid, I had a low level
kind of Tourette's grunt.
819.12 And probably me, obsessive
still to some extent--
823.2 although not full-blown
clinically diagnosed OCD,
826.02 so I can relate somewhat.
828.45 If you're willing,
what was the context
831.15 of all that before and after
this nutritional switch?
836.56 CHRIS PALMER: So before
the nutritional switch,
840.37 I was still struggling with
low grade depression and OCD.
851.24 Again, it wasn't
necessarily interfering
853.88 with my ability to function
because I was functioning
856.115 at a high level.
858.32 Anybody looking from the
outside, you're a top student.
861.265 You just got into one of
the most competitive--
863.51 actually, at that point, it was
the most competitive residency
866.42 program in the country
for psychiatry.
869.21 So they would have looked
at me and said, you're fine.
871.62 But I wasn't.
872.93 I was actually on medications.
874.59 I was trying
different medications,
876.74 trying to figure out
how to feel better,
879.77 how to stop obsessing so much,
how to not be so depressed.
884.51 And I found that
those medications,
889.97 they actually came with
more side effects for me
892.47 than benefits.
894.42 I was on Prozac for a long time.
896.31 It totally messed up my sleep.
898.482 And then the
psychiatrist was like,
899.94 you need pills to
help you sleep now.
902.28 And I'm-- I just--
903.11 I'm like, that doesn't--
904.68 that's not really resonating
very well with me.
907.05 And I'm now a psychiatrist.
908.52 I'm in my psychiatry residency.
910.32 And I'm thinking, you know what?
912.3 That's just not
sitting well with me
915.03 that you're going to prescribe
more and more meds for all
917.73 the side effects
that you're causing.
920.207 And yet at the same time,
I wanted to feel better.
922.29 And I was learning
chemical imbalances.
925.41 This is what we do to get
rid of depression and OCD.
928.44 You're supposed to
take your pills.
929.91 And so I was taking my pills.
931.8 I was in psychotherapy.
933.24 I had been in psychotherapy
on and off for years.
937.62 I had received much
more intensive treatment
939.63 when I was younger.
940.77 And that was essentially
worthless for me.
944.16 It actually probably just caused
harm at the end of the day.
947.94 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Psychoanalysis?
951.068 CHRIS PALMER: Various
psychotherapies-- not
952.86 psychoanalysis per
se, but some of them
955.05 were psychoanalytically-oriented
psychotherapies.
958.77 I was actually
hospitalized at one point.
962.046 I had been put on lithium
and imipramine, which
966.57 is a tricyclic antidepressant,
and other things.
970.8 And they were actually horrible.
973.86 They were horrible.
974.76 They did nothing
beneficial for me.
978.27 I gave them a decent
amount of time to work.
981.0 I really wanted to feel better.
985.3 So at the time that
I tried this diet,
988.92 I certainly wasn't
impaired in the same way.
991.47 I wasn't struggling that much.
993.36 But I was-- still have
these low grade symptoms,
996.0 was trying to feel better.
998.28 And the thing that was
the most striking to me,
1003.19 after doing the diet
for three months,
1005.68 was not the fact that my
metabolic syndrome was gone.
1008.72 That was my goal, and it
was a seemingly miraculous
1014.17 achievement because I
got rid of everything
1017.35 with one dietary change.
1019.69 But the thing that I noticed
was dramatic improvement
1022.9 in my mood, energy,
concentration, and sleep.
1027.55 I-- for the first
time in my life,
1030.89 I started waking up
before my alarm went off
1033.46 and feeling rested.
1035.349 That never happened
to me before.
1038.155 I was meticulous about
planning when my alarm went off
1042.339 and how many times I could
push the snooze button in order
1046.45 to be on time for
wherever I needed to be,
1049.55 whether it was school or
the hospital or whatever.
1054.01 I had it.
1055.25 I had this good system.
1056.29 I was never late for anything.
1058.3 But that was shocking to
me, that I felt so good.
1066.24 And one of the things that I've
often said to people, prior
1070.08 to the diet, I always felt
like there are two types
1073.5 of people in the world.
1074.8 There are "haves"
and "have-nots."
1076.6 There are these
happy, peppy people,
1079.26 who just are so positive,
and they've got energy.
1083.07 And they have the
saying, they like
1085.38 to work hard and play hard.
1088.83 And I always understood
working hard.
1091.14 I totally got that because
I was a hard worker
1093.39 and I understood the
value of hard work.
1095.4 And you got to do something
useful with yourself.
1099.39 But I never understood who
the hell wants to play hard,
1103.86 like who's got energy for that?
1106.03 Aren't you tired
from working so hard?
1108.09 How on Earth do these
people have energy
1111.36 to go and play hard?
1114.43 And I assumed that
they were just part
1117.13 of the "haves" in the world.
1119.95 And they were just
lucky and privileged.
1122.26 They either had good
genetics or maybe they
1125.23 had good childhoods
or good parents
1128.26 or something-- something
that I didn't have.
1130.435 ANDREW HUBERMAN: The
kids with genuine smiles
1132.31 in the yearbooks.
1133.18 CHRIS PALMER: Yes, exactly.
1134.425 ANDREW HUBERMAN: [LAUGHS]
1135.04 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
1135.79 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Whereas, the rest--
1138.19 and by the way, I
really appreciate
1140.17 you sharing some of
your personal story
1142.48 because I think it is
very important for people
1146.02 to hear and understand
that people like yourself,
1149.44 who are extremely high
functioning and accomplished,
1152.23 that the road was--
1155.71 from everything I'm hearing
and understanding-- very choppy
1159.25 internally at times,
and that you've overcome
1161.95 a lot in order to get there.
1163.16 And also, have been
going through what
1165.58 sounds like a very long
iterative process of trying
1168.16 to figure out what
works and what
1169.54 doesn't work to finally
arrive at a solution,
1172.15 and then make that the
basis of much of the work
1175.152 that you're doing
today for other people.
1176.86 I think it's very important
because I think many people
1179.8 share with you this
notion that there
1183.44 are indeed two
groups-- a happy group
1185.92 and then fated-to-be
unhappy group.
1188.77 And it speaks to the fact that--
1192.16 your story, rather, speaks
to the fact that what we see
1195.28 is not always what's going on
internally with people and that
1200.11 this notion of there
just being two groups--
1202.27 the happy or the haves
and the have-nots--
1205.9 can't be the way that it
works, and there are probably
1208.15 many more people
suffering than we realize,
1211.01 and that there is an
important need for tools
1214.03 to overcome that suffering.
1215.78 So I really just hear you.
1217.39 Even early in our
discussion, I just
1218.89 want to extend a genuine
thanks because so much
1222.04 of what I hear from people
is questions about health,
1225.455 and mental health,
and physical health.
1227.08 But that clearly
point to the fact
1229.51 that many people are
struggling to varying degrees.
1232.12 And even the people who
are in this category
1234.13 of great childhood and
happiness could do far better
1238.27 for themselves and then
also for other people.
1240.8 So thank you for that.
1243.23 I want to know.
1245.311 At the point where you
realized that nutrition
1248.65 can play a profound role
in how you feel and operate
1252.07 in a large number
of domains, you
1255.29 are still a student or a
resident at that point?
1257.29 CHRIS PALMER: I was a resident.
1259.05 ANDREW HUBERMAN: At
that point, did you
1260.07 decide that you were
going to explore
1261.63 this in a professional context?
1263.973 CHRIS PALMER: Not yet.
1264.89 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
1265.723 So what was the journey
forward into the work
1268.38 that you're doing now?
1271.68 CHRIS PALMER: So the
next step was that I just
1274.23 had friends and
family who saw me,
1277.56 saw that I had
improved my health,
1279.69 saw that I lost some
weight pretty easily.
1283.53 In particular, I remember
my sister and sister-in-law,
1286.23 they got really pissed
at me one Thanksgiving
1288.9 because I could resist all the
pumpkin pie, and apple pie,
1292.08 and everything else.
1292.96 They were like, how the
hell are you doing that?
1294.96 How are you resisting
all of this food?
1297.57 And I said, I don't
crave it anymore.
1299.29 I don't want it, I'm fine.
1300.73 I'm just-- I'm having
turkey and green beans.
1302.94 And that's good enough for me.
1305.35 So I got them to do the diet.
1307.41 And they too noticed dramatic
improvement in their moods,
1310.8 and energy, and sleep,
and everything else.
1314.11 So within a few years, the
primary thing I noticed
1320.88 is this powerful
antidepressant effect.
1325.11 And now, I'm an
attending physician.
1328.77 I've got all these patients
in my clinical practice
1331.2 with treatment resistant
mental illness.
1333.0 I'm in a tertiary care hospital.
1335.26 So I almost never get
somebody off the street
1339.0 with their first
episode of depression.
1341.4 Out of the gate, as
part of my career,
1344.1 I get treatment resistant
mental disorders.
1346.48 So I get people who've already
been to 6-plus psychiatrists,
1350.31 therapists.
1351.21 They've usually tried dozens
of different medications.
1354.12 They've been in decades
of psychotherapy.
1356.76 They've often had
ECT and other things.
1359.85 And nothing's working.
1361.74 And I'm thinking,
well, we're kind
1363.39 of out of options for
these other people.
1365.55 And this diet is having this
really powerful antidepressant
1368.85 effect.
1369.66 I think I'm going to try it and
just see if any of my patients
1372.42 are game to try it to see
if it might help them.
1376.44 Sure enough, it did.
1378.85 Didn't help everyone
and not everybody
1380.7 was interested
and/or able to do it.
1384.0 But some of the ones
who were able to do it
1387.03 ended up having a remarkable and
powerful antidepressant effect.
1391.44 One woman actually became
hypomanic within a month.
1394.83 And she had been
depressed pretty much
1397.59 nonstop for over five years--
1399.75 chronically depressed, suicidal,
in and out of hospitals.
1403.71 And I saw her become hypomanic.
1405.24 And I'm thinking,
wow, this really
1406.68 is a powerful
antidepressant effect.
1409.26 This is amazing.
1410.58 This is like a medication but
better because it actually
1414.0 is working for her.
1417.6 But I laid low at that point
because, at that point,
1421.59 we didn't have many clinical
trials of the safety
1425.15 or efficacy of the Atkins
diet for even weight loss
1428.72 or diabetes, let alone
any mental disorders.
1431.79 And so I really actually felt
like I'm on the fringe here.
1434.63 And this is not going to be
met with praise by anyone.
1440.13 So I'm just going to lay low.
1441.77 I'm going to offer
it to patients.
1445.25 And I went along that
way up until 2016.
1452.27 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And may
I just ask about the diet?
1454.46 When you say "Atkins diet,"
so this is low to zero starch,
1460.46 so low carbohydrate diet,
certainly low sugar.
1463.61 CHRIS PALMER: Yeah.
1465.02 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And was
it traditional Atkins?
1468.2 Were you tailoring it to
the individual patient
1470.72 depending on their
psychiatric symptoms,
1473.96 whether or not they were
overweight or not overweight?
1476.655 I'm assuming you're
not a nutritionist,
1478.28 so how did you
prescribe a nutrition
1481.49 plan for your patients?
1483.92 And what was involved
in making sure
1485.81 that they adhered
to that, maybe even
1488.643 some of the things
you observed in terms
1490.31 of who was more willing to
try this or not try this?
1493.57 Any observations
or maybe even data?
1496.46 CHRIS PALMER: So early
on, I was winging it.
1498.5 And I was-- the
first few patients,
1501.8 it was try this Atkins diet.
1504.02 I want to see ketosis, so
I was going for ketones.
1507.043 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So they
were pricking their finger,
1509.21 and they were doing
a blood ketone test?
1512.42 CHRIS PALMER: I didn't know
about blood ketone monitors
1515.15 if they existed back then.
1516.62 So I was-- we were
using urine strips.
1518.52 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which
are not quite as accurate
1520.52 but still useful as a general
guide, from what I understand.
1522.94 CHRIS PALMER: True.
1523.26 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that right?
1523.76 CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
1524.155 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
1527.54 CHRIS PALMER: So I was strongly
recommending that patients
1531.74 achieve urinary ketosis.
1534.17 And the interesting thing
is I noticed a pattern,
1537.38 that when they were trying the
diet and not getting ketones,
1540.265 they often did not get
a clinical benefit.
1543.26 It was once they
got into ketosis
1545.51 that I began to notice
the clinical benefit
1548.63 and the powerful
antidepressant effect.
1552.09 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So probably
any nutrition plan, a.k.a diet,
1557.49 that elevated ketones in the
urine to the point where you
1561.84 would say, this
person is in ketosis--
1564.42 or they would say
I'm in ketosis--
1566.52 that was a step in
the right direction,
1568.74 independent of exactly what
they were eating or not
1572.79 eating to get there,
including fasting?
1576.24 At that time, probably,
fasting wasn't as popular now.
1578.58 Thanks to the incredible work--
1580.65 I think it's incredible, and
he is a former colleague.
1582.99 And I know there's a lot of
controversy about fasting.
1585.06 But I think, for many people,
fasting is a powerful tool.
1587.435 For others, it's
a less useful tool
1590.01 --of Satchin Panda and others.
1593.67 But fasting certainly will
limit your carbohydrate intake
1596.88 and get you into ketosis.
1598.02 Correct?
1598.543 CHRIS PALMER: It will.
1599.46 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Did you
have any patients fast
1600.99 or do intermittent fasting?
1602.37 CHRIS PALMER: I did.
1606.3 I had some patients who did what
Atkins had called a fat fast,
1610.92 where they eat primarily fat.
1613.65 So they either fast and/or
they eat primarily fats
1617.04 to try to get into
a state of ketosis.
1619.908 So for some patients,
it was actually
1621.45 quite easy to get into
ketosis, especially overweight
1624.75 and obese patients.
1626.62 They have a lot of fat
stores on their body
1628.53 and actually limiting
carbohydrates
1630.57 usually results in high
levels of ketosis for them.
1633.923 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And they probably
1635.34 feel better too, I
imagine, because when
1637.47 we limit our starch
intake, we start
1639.6 to excrete a lot of water.
1640.74 People can get some
pretty quick weight loss
1644.22 that even though it
may not be fat loss,
1646.11 makes them feel literally
a little lighter
1648.15 and maybe a little
more energetic.
1650.117 Is that right?
1650.7 CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
1653.67 And as the years went on,
the field was advancing,
1658.41 more research was coming out.
1661.11 People were getting a
little more sophisticated
1663.27 with blood ketone monitoring,
with different versions
1666.69 of ketogenic diets.
1668.52 And I was evolving my practice.
1675.08 The thing that completely
upended everything
1678.185 that I knew as a psychiatrist,
though, was when I helped
1681.35 a patient in 2016 lose weight.
1684.75 So this was a patient,
33-year-old man
1688.19 with schizoaffective disorder.
1690.23 He had been my patient
for eight years now.
1692.06 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Could you clarify
1692.75 for people what
schizoaffective disorder is?
1694.73 I'm not a clinician.
1695.69 But as I recall, it's like a
low level of schizophrenia.
1700.182 So there might be some
auditory hallucinations.
1702.14 If I met this
person, I might think
1703.49 they're kind of different,
quote unquote, "weird."
1705.573 But they would not
seem necessarily
1710.99 scary to me and to
typically to other people.
1716.03 And I mean that with
respect, of course.
1717.742 But oftentimes, people
with schizophrenia
1719.45 can seem just like--
you don't even
1721.16 know how to interact with
them because their world seems
1723.493 so altered because they have
all these so-called positive
1726.627 symptoms-- hallucinations,
and they're
1728.21 talking to people that no
one else can see, et cetera.
1730.49 Is that schizoaffective?
1732.41 CHRIS PALMER: So no.
1733.7 So schizoaffective is the same
as schizophrenia essentially.
1737.51 The only difference
is it's schizophrenia
1739.7 with superimposed mood episodes.
1741.447 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, so it's
actually more severe than--
1743.78 CHRIS PALMER: It can be.
1744.62 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
1744.92 So I have it backwards.
1745.94 CHRIS PALMER: So
schizoaffective disorder
1747.98 is essentially schizophrenia
and plus some mood episodes.
1751.193 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe
I'm thinking of schizotypal?
1753.485 CHRIS PALMER: Schizotypal
is the low grade,
1756.8 kind of mild paranoia, or
kind of eccentric beliefs,
1761.0 and other things.
1761.9 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
1762.997 Folks out there, I have
my nomenclature backwards.
1765.08 Schizotypal is the,
quote unquote, lower--
1767.66 "low level" schizophrenia
or schizoid-like.
1771.47 Schizoaffective is
as or more severe.
1773.757 CHRIS PALMER:
Full-blown schizophrenia
1775.34 plus full-blown
usually bipolarism.
1776.982 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And now,
it's absolutely clear
1778.94 who the clinician
in the room is.
1780.62 [LAUGHTER]
1781.16 Thank you for that reminder.
1783.2 CHRIS PALMER: No worries.
1784.55 So this man had
schizoaffective disorder.
1788.666 He had daily auditory
hallucinations.
1791.63 He had paranoid delusions.
1793.58 He could not go out in public
without being terrified.
1798.47 He was convinced that there
were these powerful families,
1802.37 that they had technologies that
could control his thoughts.
1805.16 They could broadcast his
thoughts to other people.
1807.44 They were trying to hurt him.
1808.88 They had targeted
him for some reason.
1811.04 He wasn't quite sure why.
1812.63 He had some suspicions
and beliefs about maybe
1815.96 when he did this bad thing when
he was 11 years old, that's why
1820.31 they decided to target him.
1822.83 This man was tormented by
his illness, tormented.
1826.37 It ruined his life.
1828.17 He had already tried 17
different medications,
1831.02 and none of them
stopped his symptoms.
1833.36 But they did cause him
to gain a lot of weight.
1835.86 ANDREW HUBERMAN: These
medications, as I recall,
1837.86 for schizophrenia-- the
classical ones are dopamine
1840.425 receptor blockers--
caused people to--
1843.29 huge increases in prolactin.
1845.147 That's why sometimes men--
1846.23 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
1846.44 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --will
get breast development.
1847.85 And they'll put on
a lot of weight.
1849.308 And they'll be catatonic--
or movement disorders.
1851.93 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
1852.68 ANDREW HUBERMAN: They
make you feel like--
1854.43 I have to imagine,
given how good
1856.46 most things that release
dopamine make us feel,
1858.62 that blocking dopamine
receptors with antipsychotics
1861.89 makes people feel lousy.
1863.96 CHRIS PALMER: Horrible.
1866.45 And it's a huge challenge in our
field because a lot of patients
1869.84 don't want to take them.
1872.09 And then you get
these rebound effects.
1874.1 If patients are on them
for several months,
1876.29 and then they stop
them cold turkey,
1878.12 they can get wildly
psychotic and ill,
1880.64 end up aggressive or
hospitalized or sometimes dead.
1889.39 So that's him.
1890.59 He weighs 340 pounds.
1892.81 And for whatever reason,
he gets it in his head,
1895.33 I'm never going to
get a girlfriend
1896.92 if I don't lose some weight.
1899.74 He also recognizes,
I'm never going
1901.6 to get a girlfriend
because I'm a loser.
1903.34 I'm schizophrenic.
1904.57 I live with my father.
1906.28 I have nothing going for me.
1908.18 But I could at
least try to address
1911.62 one of these awful, horrible
things about myself.
1915.19 And maybe I could
lose some weight.
1917.05 So he asked for my help.
1919.69 For a variety of
reasons, we ended up
1921.25 deciding to try
the ketogenic diet.
1923.65 Now, at this point, I
have no anticipation
1928.18 that the ketogenic diet
is going to do anything
1930.19 for his psychiatric
symptoms because this man
1933.31 has schizoaffective disorder.
1934.6 That's not depression.
1935.99 Depression is very different.
1937.67 They're totally
different disorders.
1940.77 So he decides to give it a try.
1944.36 Within two weeks, not only
does he start losing weight,
1948.53 but I begin to notice this
dramatic antidepressant effect.
1952.25 He's making better eye contact.
1954.17 He's smiling more.
1955.4 He's talking a lot more.
1957.2 I'm thinking like,
what's gotten into you?
1959.09 You're coming to life.
1960.05 Like you're-- I've never
heard you talk this much.
1962.133 I've never seen you so
excited or present or alive.
1967.35 I haven't changed
his meds at all.
1970.86 The thing that
upended everything
1973.41 that I knew as a psychiatrist
was six to eight weeks in,
1977.49 he spontaneously
starts reporting,
1979.77 you know, those voices
that I hear all the time?
1982.68 They're going away.
1985.44 And he says, you know how I
always thought that there were
1988.29 all these families who were
controlling my thoughts
1990.87 and out to get me, and
they had targeted me?
1993.12 And I'm thinking, oh, yeah.
1994.703 We've been talking about
that for eight years.
1996.62 We can talk about that again.
1998.37 He says, you know what?
2002.88 Now that I think about it,
I don't think that's true.
2006.077 And now that I say it,
it sounds kind of crazy.
2008.035 It probably never was.
2011.28 I've probably had
schizophrenia all along
2013.71 like everybody's been
trying to tell me.
2016.82 And I think it's going away.
2020.3 That man went on--
2022.58 he's now lost 160 pounds
and kept it off to this day.
2026.06 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
2027.29 CHRIS PALMER: He was
able to do things
2029.3 he had not been able to do
since the time of his diagnosis.
2032.21 He was able to complete
a certificate program.
2034.67 He's able to go out in
public and not be paranoid.
2038.03 He performed improv in
front of a live audience.
2041.31 at?
2041.81 One point, he was able to
move out of his father's home
2044.93 and live independently.
2047.46 And that completely blew
my mind as a psychiatrist.
2054.969 And I went on a
scientific journey
2057.909 to understand what in
the hell just happened.
2060.82 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That
is indeed mind-blowing.
2063.04 I'd like to take a quick
break and acknowledge
2065.29 one of our sponsors,
Athletic Greens.
2067.48 Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
is a vitamin mineral probiotic
2071.77 drink that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.
2075.13 I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,
2077.889 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
2080.17 The reason I started taking
Athletic Greens and the reason
2082.587 I still take Athletic Greens
once or usually twice a day
2085.659 is that it gets
me the probiotics
2087.76 that I need for gut health.
2089.409 Our gut is very important.
2090.55 It's populated by
gut microbiota that
2093.06 communicate with the brain, the
immune system, and basically
2095.56 all the biological
systems of our body
2097.27 to strongly impact our
immediate and long-term health.
2100.81 And those probiotics
in Athletic Greens
2102.76 are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health.
2106.513 In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number
2108.43 of adaptogens,
vitamins, and minerals
2110.05 that make sure that all of my
foundational nutritional needs
2112.69 are met.
2113.32 And it tastes great.
2115.318 If you'd like to
try Athletic Greens,
2116.86 you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
2120.04 and they'll give you five
free travel packs that make it
2122.59 really easy to mix up
Athletic Greens while
2124.607 you're on the road, in the
car, on the plane, et cetera.
2126.94 And they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3/K2.
2130.51 Again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman
2133.12 to get the five free travel
packs and the year supply
2135.7 of vitamin D3/K2.
2137.47 I have a couple of questions.
2139.16 First of all, did
he stay on any kind
2141.91 of antipsychotic or
other medication?
2145.33 If so, were the dosages
adjusted, excuse me,
2148.84 while undergoing this
remarkable transition?
2153.22 Because as we know,
it's not an either
2155.08 or medication or nutrition
changes, it can be both.
2159.61 And then the other question
is one of adherence.
2163.15 I think about someone with
schizoaffective disorder,
2165.79 who's suffering from
all the sorts of things
2168.34 that you described.
2170.28 How does somebody like that
organize themselves in order
2172.83 to stay on a ketogenic diet?
2175.23 And I say this with all the
seriousness in the world.
2177.485 I think there are
a lot of people
2178.86 who do not have schizotypal
or schizoaffective disorder
2182.85 who have trouble, they claim,
adhering to a ketogenic diet.
2189.66 It's not the easiest diet.
2191.93 Certainly in its
extreme form at first,
2194.51 it's not the easiest
diet to stick to.
2197.85 So how did he do it?
2199.41 That sounds like a
remarkable individual.
2202.17 And I'd also like to just
know your general thoughts
2204.36 about adherence to things when
people are back on their heels
2209.34 mentally.
2210.22 How do they get motivated
and stick to something?
2213.7 So the questions were,
medication, yes or no?
2216.22 If yes, dosage
adjusted, yes or no.
2219.27 And if people are
suffering from depression
2223.095 or full-blown
psychotic episodes,
2225.21 how does one ensure that they
continue to adhere to a diet?
2230.25 CHRIS PALMER: So in
terms of medications,
2232.68 he has remained on medication.
2235.93 So early on, I wasn't
adjusting anything.
2238.71 I was just in disbelief and
shock that this was happening.
2242.49 I didn't know what was going on.
2244.83 Over the years, we
have slowly but surely
2247.8 tried to taper him off his meds.
2249.9 He has been on meds for decades.
2253.02 He started medications
when he was a young child.
2256.62 His brain is as
developed in response
2263.04 to all sorts of
psychiatric medications.
2266.25 And it has not been easy
to try to get him off.
2270.03 We continue to try to
get him off medication.
2272.76 And it's challenging
and difficult.
2276.13 And I just want to say
for any listeners, it is--
2279.36 getting off your meds is
very difficult and dangerous.
2282.33 And you need to do
it with supervision,
2284.73 with a mental health
professional or a prescriber
2289.8 because it is dangerous.
2291.24 When people reduce
their meds too much,
2294.54 they can get wildly symptomatic.
2297.312 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that
true for depression as well?
2299.52 CHRIS PALMER: It's true for
any psychiatric medication.
2302.76 The brain makes
adaptations in response
2304.98 to psychiatric medications.
2306.99 And when you stop
them cold turkey--
2310.71 some people are fine.
2312.09 But I wouldn't
recommend finding out
2315.78 because I've seen patients--
when they stop antidepressants,
2319.62 I've seen patients get
flooredly depressed and suicidal
2324.0 within three months.
2325.17 I had one patient,
almost quit her job
2327.63 because she became convinced
that, well, my life sucks,
2332.73 and it's all because of my boss.
2334.17 And I know that she's just
a horrible human being.
2338.07 And she's abusing me.
2339.3 And I was like,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
2341.28 I think this is related
to your medication change.
2343.65 We got her back on her
meds, within three days,
2347.74 she said, oh my god, I
can't believe that happened.
2351.63 I almost quit my job.
2353.52 And that would have been the
most illogical and irrational
2356.775 decision I've ever
made in my entire life.
2359.97 But somehow, it seemed so
real just several days ago.
2365.1 And now that I'm back
on this medication--
2367.77 and it doesn't mean
that she needs the meds.
2370.71 But it doesn't mean
that he needs the meds.
2372.84 It means that meds need to
be adjusted very safely,
2375.99 and cautiously, and gradually.
2378.69 So that's the medication piece.
2380.25 The adherence piece was not easy
for him and for other patients.
2385.71 It is very rare that I have
a patient who I can say,
2389.7 do the ketogenic diet.
2391.02 Come see me in 3 months, and
let me know how it was going.
2394.35 That almost never happens.
2397.21 It has happened, I
think, on two occasions.
2399.57 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that is, if
I understand correctly, what--
2402.78 perhaps not you-- but
many psychiatrists
2405.39 do with medication.
2406.74 It's, here's your prescription.
2408.36 Let's talk in--
2409.35 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
2410.1 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a
month or three months.
2411.21 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
2412.14 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's
a variable that is probably
2414.39 worth us exploring
a little bit here
2415.95 as the conversation continues.
2417.398 CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
2418.44 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That frequent contact
2420.023 and making micro
adjustments or macro
2422.4 adjustments to medication or
nutrition, could be meaningful.
2426.278 CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
2427.32 So with this particular
patient, early on, he
2431.67 was actually pretty adherent.
2433.14 I was seeing him once a week.
2435.79 And so I could do
a lot of education.
2438.3 I was weighing him.
2439.59 I was checking his ketones.
2441.24 I was checking his
glucose levels.
2443.37 At that point, I had a blood
ketone monitor in my office.
2446.85 So I knew whether he
was compliant or not,
2449.97 which is so beneficial
in doing clinical work
2454.08 and research on this diet.
2455.73 It's the only diet
where within seconds, I
2458.85 can have an objective biomarker
of compliance or noncompliance.
2463.38 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Such
a key point and again,
2465.78 brings to mind, for me, the
parallel with medication.
2469.11 A patient can say they're
taking their medication,
2472.02 and unless they're in
a hospital setting,
2474.278 where somebody's checking under
their tongue and all of this,
2476.82 they very well could not be
taking it or taking more.
2480.78 And you and I both
know that blood
2484.14 draws for neurotransmitter
levels are complicated
2486.687 because you want to
know what's in the brain
2488.52 and what's functional
in the brain.
2490.448 And then we have to imagine that
most people there prescribed
2492.99 drugs for any number of
different psychiatric
2495.66 conditions are not giving
blood every time they
2497.82 talk to their psychiatrist
or psychologist.
2499.62 No?
2500.52 CHRIS PALMER: No.
2502.815 On that front, when we've
looked at studies of compliance,
2506.49 the majority of
patients are at least
2510.27 somewhat noncompliant with
prescription medications.
2513.99 It's not on purpose.
2516.96 They forgot.
2518.34 They take it at night.
2519.66 They were out late.
2521.52 They were off their routine.
2524.1 They forgot to
brush their teeth--
2526.35 because that's when
they take their meds.
2528.36 And so because it was
so late, they just
2531.75 crashed when they got home.
2533.1 They forgot to take their meds.
2534.83 Happens all the time.
2536.61 If it's a medication that people
take more than once a day,
2539.58 the noncompliance rates are
much higher because it's just
2543.66 easy to forget.
2544.62 So it's not that people
are willfully disobeying
2548.25 their doctors or anything else.
2550.21 It's just hard to remember
to take meds consistently
2553.14 every day.
2554.28 ANDREW HUBERMAN: When you
say measuring ketones,
2556.44 I want to drill into
this a little bit
2558.81 because it does seem that
the presence of ketones
2563.1 and somebody being, quote
unquote, "in ketosis,"
2566.02 it turns out to be
the key variable.
2567.52 Certainly, in your book, that's
one of the major takeaways--
2571.21 although there were many
important takeaways--
2574.12 that people get into ketosis.
2576.49 Do they have to stay in ketosis?
2578.62 So for instance,
I've followed the--
2580.72 I don't any longer.
2581.68 But I've tried, in the past,
the so-called cyclic ketogenic
2584.38 diet, where every third
or fourth day, get
2586.45 some pasta, or rice, et cetera.
2591.64 That was interesting
as an experiment.
2594.19 But to stay in ketosis, what
sort of blood levels of ketones
2600.07 do you like to see
in your patients?
2602.44 What is the range that you think
most people could aspire to?
2606.89 CHRIS PALMER: So it really
depends on the patient
2609.01 and what I'm treating,
quite honestly.
2613.44 And I don't think every patient
needs the ketogenic diet.
2616.41 For some patients, simply
getting rid of junk food
2618.72 can make a huge difference in
a mood disorder, for instance.
2621.643 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So a junk food,
meaning, highly processed food,
2624.31 food that could last on
the shelf a very long time.
2626.52 CHRIS PALMER: Highly
processed foods
2628.2 that are usually high in
both sugar, carbohydrate,
2631.83 and carbs, and fats.
2634.95 Those seem to be
the worst foods.
2638.07 That combination--
high sugar, high fat--
2642.57 seems to be the
worst combination
2644.46 for metabolic health.
2646.2 And lo and behold, we've got
emerging data that suggests,
2650.37 that strongly suggests, it's
also bad for mental health.
2653.79 Depression and anxiety are the
most common mental disorders.
2657.39 And so we have the best
data for those disorders.
2660.36 But we actually have a lot of
data with even bipolar disorder
2663.9 and schizophrenia that insulin
resistance, in particular,
2668.1 and insulin signaling
in the brain
2671.22 is impaired in people with
chronic mental disorders
2676.08 kind of across the board--
2677.91 all the way from chronic
anxiety, depression,
2680.73 to bipolar, to schizophrenia,
and even Alzheimer's disease.
2684.39 We know that patients with
all of those disorders
2687.15 have impaired glucose metabolism
and that the insulin signaling
2693.285 system in the brain, which
is different than insulin
2695.85 signaling in the
periphery, seems to somehow
2700.53 possibly be playing a role.
2704.16 So to step back from that,
so for some patients,
2706.8 I might just want to decrease
glucose and insulin levels.
2710.41 And I can do that by
getting rid of sweets.
2713.43 For other patients,
like patients
2715.8 with schizoaffective disorder
or schizophrenia or bipolar
2718.53 disorder, especially
if it's chronic,
2720.6 if I'm using it as
a brain treatment,
2724.83 then I do want a ketogenic diet.
2727.38 And I usually want reasonably
high levels of blood ketones.
2731.52 Usually, for depression, I
want to see at least greater
2736.01 than probably 0.8 minimal.
2739.25 For psychotic disorders
and bipolar disorder,
2744.38 I usually want to see
levels greater than 1.5.
2747.98 That's what I'm shooting
for, if at all possible.
2755.57 So yeah, I think
that's what I'd go for.
2759.59 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--
2760.97 and sorry, I didn't
mean to imply
2762.38 that people need to
be in ketosis in order
2764.78 to see some mental health
benefits from changing
2767.63 their diet.
2769.52 You make very clear
in your book--
2771.14 and we'll go into
this in more detail--
2773.54 that avoiding
insulin resistance,
2776.76 reversing insulin resistance,
and essentially trying
2780.3 to reverse what
earlier you described
2782.55 as this metabolic
syndrome, which
2785.37 is a bunch of different
things, is the target.
2788.79 And for some people, getting
rid of highly processed foods
2792.39 and focusing mainly on
nonprocessed or minimally
2794.97 processed foods
will really help.
2796.5 For others, going straight to
the full-blown ketogenic diet
2799.74 will be of most benefit.
2802.34 I'd like to back up a
little bit in history
2804.65 and get to something which I
find incredibly interesting,
2808.89 which is epilepsy and
the longstanding use
2812.87 of ketogenic diet and
fasting to treat epilepsy.
2816.98 And the reason I want to kind of
rewind to that point in history
2821.06 is that, I think that for a
lot of listeners and people
2825.89 out there who are familiar
with how changing your diet
2830.09 or changing your
exercise can positively
2832.1 impact sleep and weight
and all these things,
2834.32 and it cascades into
feeling better--
2836.54 that makes perfect sense.
2838.32 But for a lot of
the world still,
2841.27 the idea that changing or using
nutrition as a dissection tool
2847.39 or as a treatment tool
to understand and treat
2850.45 mental illness, is still
a kind of heretical idea,
2854.05 that to them, it
kind of falls in the,
2855.91 OK, well, that's like a woo
science or something like that.
2859.6 Now, obviously you're a
board-certified physician
2862.27 or psychiatrist at arguably one
of the finest medical schools
2866.59 in the world, Harvard
Medical School.
2869.38 Even though I'm on the
Stanford side, we acknowledge--
2871.63 we acknowledge our East Coast--
2873.67 CHRIS PALMER:
You're the Harvard--
2874.12 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --friends.
2874.54 CHRIS PALMER: --of
the West Coast.
2875.5 ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're
not going to talk--
2876.16 OK.
2876.505 CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]
2876.85 ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're
not going to talk--
2877.63 CHRIS PALMER: Or we're the
Stanford of the East Coast.
2879.4 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That argument
could go back and forth
2881.65 a number of times.
2882.79 You're a serious clinician
and a serious scientist.
2886.36 And you're a serious thinker.
2889.09 But for a lot of
people out there,
2891.04 the notion of using
diet, they immediately
2894.07 think, ah, well, that
makes perfect sense.
2897.1 Or I think there's a category
of people who think, well, yeah,
2900.31 didn't Atkins die
of a heart attack?
2902.14 I hear that a lot.
2904.51 That was crazy.
2905.83 People immediately
discard the Atkins diet
2909.49 for that reason, which I do
think is throwing the baby out
2912.808 with the bathwater.
2913.6 But it's an interesting
thing nonetheless.
2915.577 And then I think that
the majority of people
2917.41 sit in the middle
and just want to see
2920.17 science and medicine come up
with treatments that work.
2922.85 And I have to say, I'm very
relieved to hear what you said
2926.262 earlier, which was-- you never
said that people should come
2928.72 off their medication
and just become--
2930.52 go on a ketogenic diet and
everything will be cured.
2933.04 You're certainly
not saying that.
2934.432 CHRIS PALMER: No.
2935.14 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And rather you're
2936.73 saying, if I
understand correctly,
2938.8 that nutrition needs
to be considered
2941.47 one of the major tools in the
landscape of effective tools
2945.13 and that it can
be very effective,
2946.6 evidenced by the
story that you shared.
2948.55 And there are many
other stories in there
2950.86 as well of truly
miraculous transformations.
2955.16 So let's talk about epilepsy and
how the ketogenic diet is not
2959.74 just used for
epilepsy but is one
2962.53 of the oldest, if not
the oldest, examples
2965.44 of the use of nutrition
to treat a condition
2969.16 of the nervous system
that can be incredibly
2971.35 debilitating, even deadly.
2972.838 CHRIS PALMER: Yeah.
2973.63 And the reality is
that this literature,
2977.38 and this clinical history, and
all of the research we have
2980.95 was the godsend that I needed
to do the work that I'm doing.
2985.72 Otherwise, I would have
been discredited on day one.
2989.3 Chris Palmer is claiming
that a dietary change
2992.3 can influence schizophrenia
or schizoaffective disorder.
2995.54 That's impossible.
2996.77 And he's a quack.
2999.15 But the thing that immediately
got me credibility was I
3003.19 didn't focus on it as a diet.
3006.58 I did a deep dive into
the epilepsy literature.
3010.58 So the ketogenic diet,
unbeknownst to most people,
3014.38 was actually developed a
hundred years ago, 1921,
3019.39 by a physician for one
and only one purpose--
3023.23 to treat epilepsy.
3025.03 It wasn't developed
as a weight loss diet.
3027.19 It wasn't developed as the diet
that all human beings should
3030.97 follow.
3032.52 And the reason it
was developed is
3034.2 because of this
longstanding observation,
3038.46 since the time of Hippocrates,
that fasting can stop seizures.
3045.07 Now, fasting is
not a healthy diet.
3048.6 Fasting is the
process of no diet.
3053.77 So we now understand a
tremendous amount of science.
3057.25 Most people think going
without food is bad.
3061.1 And they equate it
with starvation.
3063.97 But in fact, when
we go without food,
3066.61 it causes tremendous
shifts in metabolism--
3070.33 both brain and body metabolism.
3073.15 And it puts the body into a mode
of autophagy, and conservation
3078.91 of resources, and all
sorts of things that
3083.65 are beneficial to human health.
3085.55 And this is why
fasting has been used
3087.4 as a therapeutic intervention
in almost every culture,
3090.55 in almost every religion
for a millennia.
3095.802 But for the most
part, that was all
3097.26 thought to be
religious folklore.
3099.375 That was just crazy talk.
3100.68 And those stupid people
way back then thought
3104.37 God cured everything.
3105.67 And so they fasted.
3106.71 And they just assumed that
they were getting better.
3109.65 Well, in 1921, one physician
used intermittent fasting
3116.69 on a child with seizures and
found that, oh, Lo and behold,
3120.03 this religious folklore
stuff has something to it.
3122.15 It actually worked.
3123.98 The problem with
fasting is that you
3125.78 can only fast for so long
before you starve to death.
3128.21 And that's not a very
effective treatment.
3130.49 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And this child
was ingesting water, correct?
3134.19 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
3134.94 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was just
food elimination fasting.
3136.79 CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination.
3137.495 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
3138.328 CHRIS PALMER: So
no special diet.
3141.11 But the problem with
fasting for epilepsy
3143.81 is that as soon as people start
eating a normal diet again,
3146.51 their seizures usually
come right back--
3148.85 oftentimes, with a vengeance.
3150.77 And so it can be a good
short-term intervention.
3154.883 The fasting can take a
few days because it can
3156.8 take a few days to get ketosis.
3159.92 And then you can get some
relief from chronic seizures.
3163.34 But it's not a good
long-term treatment
3165.68 because, again, people
will starve to death.
3169.16 As soon as they start
eating, seizures come back.
3171.59 So it was actually Dr. Russell
Wilder at the Mayo Clinic
3175.46 who developed the ketogenic diet
with one and only one purpose.
3179.49 He wanted to see, can we
mimic the fasting state, using
3184.94 this special diet, to see if it
might stop seizures long-term?
3191.72 And lo and behold, it worked.
3194.66 Early results were
extraordinarily positive.
3197.72 50% of patients who
use the ketogenic diet
3200.6 became seizure-free.
3202.25 And another 35% had a
50% or greater reduction
3206.84 in their seizure frequency,
so about 85% efficacy rate.
3210.32 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry to interrupt.
3211.82 I didn't mean to do that there.
3214.07 Was it just for
pediatric epilepsy
3216.41 or for adult epilepsy as well?
3218.042 CHRIS PALMER: So
back in the 1920s,
3219.5 we didn't have many
anti-epilepsy treatments.
3222.35 And a lot of adults
were struggling as well.
3224.4 So they were using it on
anybody who would do the diet.
3228.74 By the 1950s, pharmaceuticals
were coming out.
3232.49 And we had many more
anticonvulsant treatments.
3235.19 And there's no question, they
work for a lot of people.
3238.91 That's great.
3239.93 And taking a pill is so much
easier than doing this diet.
3243.53 So the diet pretty
much fell out of favor.
3245.69 And nobody was using it from
the 1950s to about the '70s.
3250.19 But lo and behold, even to
this day, people with epilepsy,
3254.78 about 30% don't respond
to the current treatments
3258.5 that we have available.
3259.76 30% will have treatment
resistant epilepsy,
3262.62 which means they
continue to have seizures
3264.62 no matter how many
anticonvulsants they're taking,
3267.44 even if they've
had brain surgery.
3269.48 It just doesn't
stop their seizures.
3272.18 And so in the 1970s,
the ketogenic diet
3274.61 was resurrected at Johns Hopkins
for these treatment-resistant
3278.48 cases.
3279.11 And lo and behold, it works--
3281.18 not for all of them,
but it works in--
3284.86 about 1/3 become seizure-free.
3288.613 And these are people who've
tried everything and nothing's
3291.03 working.
3291.53 So 1/3 become seizure-free.
3293.34 Another third get
a clinical benefit,
3295.87 meaning a 50% or greater
reduction in their seizure
3298.17 frequency.
3299.04 And the other third, it
doesn't seem to work.
3302.05 It's not always clear if
that's because of noncompliance
3304.71 or if that's because the
diet's just not working.
3307.38 But about a third,
a third, a third--
3309.87 seizure freedom,
reduction in seizures,
3312.39 or it just doesn't work.
3315.7 And so the reality,
the godsend for me
3318.93 is that we have decades
of neuroscience research
3321.78 on the ketogenic diet and
what it is doing to the brain.
3324.87 We know that the ketogenic diet
is influencing neurotransmitter
3328.77 levels-- in particular,
glutamate, GABA, adenosine.
3332.43 It changes calcium channel
regulation and calcium
3336.36 levels, which is really
important in the function
3338.64 of cells.
3340.32 It changes gene expression.
3342.9 It reduces brain inflammation.
3345.33 It changes the gut microbiome.
3348.0 Gut microbiome is a
huge topic right now.
3349.92 And there are some
researchers who
3351.337 argue that is the primary
benefit of the ketogenic diet--
3354.06 it's changing the gut
microbiome in beneficial ways.
3358.12 So it's doing a lot of things.
3359.88 It obviously improves
insulin resistance.
3363.015 It lowers glucose levels,
lowers insulin levels,
3366.3 which improves
insulin signaling.
3369.6 The key for my research that
I've outlined, the real magic,
3377.88 is that this diet stimulates
two processes that
3382.08 relate to mitochondria.
3383.85 It stimulates a process
called mitophagy,
3386.67 which is getting rid of old
and defective mitochondria,
3390.18 and replacing them
with new ones.
3392.16 And it also stimulates
a process called
3394.14 mitochondrial
biogenesis, which means
3397.26 that after people have done the
ketogenic diet for a while--
3401.31 months or years-- many of
their cells in their bodies
3405.69 and brains will have
more mitochondria.
3409.45 And those mitochondria
will be healthier.
3412.8 And I believe that is the reason
the ketogenic diet is such
3417.81 a powerful treatment not
only for epilepsy but also
3421.59 for people with chronic
mental disorders.
3424.698 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Would
you mind listing off
3426.49 a few of the mental disorders?
3429.73 And I know this is not
meant to be inside ball,
3432.658 but we should distinguish
between psychiatric disorders
3434.95 and neurological
symptoms and diseases.
3440.35 The fields of
psychiatry and neurology
3442.342 hopefully someday
will just emerge.
3443.8 But for instance,
typically if somebody
3446.8 is presenting with
something that
3449.05 looks like
Alzheimer's, dementia,
3451.06 they'll talk to a neurologist.
3452.47 Whereas, if somebody is
presenting with symptoms,
3454.59 like schizophrenia, bipolar,
they'll talk to a psychiatrist.
3457.09 But if you wouldn't
mind wearing a dual hat,
3460.6 could you just
quickly list off some
3462.85 of the neurologic and
psychiatric disorders
3466.57 for which ketogenic--
3468.73 or let's just say--
nutrition changes
3471.16 have been shown to improve
symptoms significantly.
3473.618 And then maybe we can dive
into a couple of these
3475.66 as well as get more deeply
into these two very interesting
3478.99 aspects of mitochondrial
function and repair
3481.96 and turnover.
3482.74 CHRIS PALMER: Yeah.
3485.575 In terms of nutritional
psychiatry, it's a broad field.
3489.38 And it's in its infancy,
is the real answer.
3492.25 If you're looking for randomized
controlled trials documenting
3495.22 efficacy in large numbers of
patients with these disorders,
3500.14 we don't have them.
3501.64 They're underway now.
3503.2 But we don't have them yet.
3504.91 What we do have
are case studies.
3508.96 We have a lot of
mechanistic science papers
3514.57 by some of the leading
neuroscientists
3516.55 and psychiatrists in the world--
3518.08 and neurologists in the
world kind of outlining,
3521.89 this is everything we know that
the ketogenic diet is doing.
3524.77 These are the
problems in the brains
3527.14 of people with these chronic
mental or neurological
3530.02 disorders.
3530.78 So we know that
they should work.
3533.02 But the disorders range
from chronic depression to--
3539.86 we've got a trial
underway for PTSD.
3543.31 We've got one
actually decent pilot
3547.69 trial from the
National Institutes
3549.85 of Health for the ketogenic
diet for alcohol use disorder,
3553.72 of all things.
3554.8 And we can go into
that a little more.
3556.66 We've got a couple of pilot
trials of the ketogenic diet
3559.81 for Alzheimer's disease.
3562.6 And those are randomized
controlled trials.
3564.79 We've got case studies
of the ketogenic diet
3569.14 for chronic depression, bipolar
disorder, and schizophrenia.
3573.4 The largest study that we've
got in that mental health sphere
3578.02 is a pilot study of 31 patients
admitted to a French hospital.
3587.78 28 of those patients
were able to do the diet
3590.57 and stay on the diet.
3592.83 So 10%, off the
bat, noncompliant,
3596.3 couldn't do the diet.
3597.39 So we need to include that.
3598.79 But of the 28 patients
who were able to do--
3601.1 and these are 28 patients with
treatment-resistant mental
3603.5 disorders, chronic depression,
bipolar, and schizophrenia.
3607.91 Of the patients who were able
to do the ketogenic diet,
3610.64 100% had at least some
improvement in symptoms.
3614.24 46% had remission of illness.
3618.35 Remission of illness,
that does not
3620.15 happen with current treatments.
3622.43 And 64%, I think, were
discharged on less medicine
3628.91 than they went into
the hospital on.
3631.43 So it wasn't that the people
were prescribing more medicine
3635.97 and that's why.
3637.19 They were being discharged
on less medication.
3641.46 We've got at least--
3642.56 again, a lot of the hard core
scientists are going to say,
3645.68 show us the randomized
controlled trial
3647.9 with hundreds of patients.
3649.98 And we've got five randomized
controlled trials underway now,
3654.89 funded primarily
through philanthropy.
3659.66 I can tell you that--
3662.93 we've talked about
that one index patient.
3665.24 But at this point, I have now
treated dozens of patients.
3668.84 And I've heard from
hundreds of patients
3671.69 who've been treated by other
clinicians, researchers--
3675.23 or I've just heard from
patients from around the world--
3678.02 who have shared stories
of complete remission
3682.61 of long, chronic
mental disorders--
3687.29 like bipolar disorder
and schizophrenia--
3690.08 off of psychiatric meds.
3691.52 Some of them-- not all
of them, but some of them
3693.77 are able to get off
all psychiatric meds
3696.47 and remain in remission.
3699.88 Again, I think I
didn't say this before.
3704.3 But it's really
important to mention.
3706.54 For people who
might be unfamiliar
3709.0 with the mental health field and
its connection with epilepsy,
3713.29 the reason that it's such
an important connection
3715.96 is that we use
epilepsy treatments
3717.94 in psychiatric patients
every day in tens of millions
3721.57 of people.
3723.14 So a lot of people
don't know this,
3725.24 but I'll list off some names
that a lot of your listeners
3729.88 may have heard of.
3730.87 And they probably know
them as psychiatric drugs.
3733.09 But in fact, these
are epilepsy drugs.
3735.22 Depakote, Tegretol,
Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin
3739.09 or gabapentin, Valium,
Klonopin, Xanax--
3744.1 those are all medications
that stop seizures.
3747.37 And many of them were developed
initially for seizures.
3753.43 But we, in the
mental health field,
3755.26 quickly steal them and start
using them in tens of millions
3758.77 of people, even if
they're off label.
3760.82 So that means, we don't have
research studies documenting
3763.87 that they're effective.
3765.02 But we go ahead
and use them anyway
3767.41 because the reality is far too
many patients aren't getting
3770.56 better with the
FDA-approved treatments
3772.75 that we do have to offer.
3774.38 So psychiatrists are just
winging it in some cases.
3777.52 And we're just throwing
whatever we can at them
3780.25 and we absolutely include
epilepsy treatments.
3783.26 So in many ways, using
the ketogenic diet
3786.04 as a treatment for
serious mental disorders,
3788.11 is nothing new at all.
3790.117 It's an established
evidence-based treatment
3791.95 for epilepsy.
3793.21 We use evidence-based
treatments for epilepsy
3796.18 across the board for a wide
range of mental disorders.
3799.9 And so in many
ways, that's all I'm
3801.64 doing with the ketogenic diet.
3803.23 It just happens to be a diet.
3804.73 [CHUCKLES]
3805.975 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.
3807.1 I love it.
3808.0 And I should say, I
love it because we
3811.42 had a guest on here early
days of the podcast.
3814.09 He's a colleague of
mine at Stanford.
3815.93 He's a bioengineer, and a
psychiatrist, phenomenal
3819.28 scientist and
psychiatrist, called
3821.47 Deisseroth, who won the Lasker
prize, and so on and so forth.
3824.708 And he made a really
important point,
3826.25 which should have
been obvious to me
3827.77 but wasn't until
he said it, which
3830.62 was the psychiatrist has tools,
just like the surgeon has
3835.64 tools.
3836.14 But the tools are language
and observing behavior.
3841.33 Those are the dissection
tools for what's
3843.55 going on in someone's brain.
3844.81 And then as a
neuroscientist, I'm
3846.612 familiar with the
neurotransmitters
3848.07 and neuromodulators.
3849.37 And you mentioned that--
3852.66 and there are these tools of
altering brain chemistry, which
3858.03 are of the sorts of
drugs you just listed
3859.95 off, or antidepressants,
or antipsychotics,
3862.14 that fall into these
major bins of adjusting
3864.09 dopamine or adjusting
serotonin or some combination
3866.58 of dopamine, serotonin
epinephrine, adenosine,
3869.34 and on, and on, and on.
3870.66 And it seems to me, it's
an incredible field.
3874.63 But that the field is still
very much in its infancy
3877.33 that it wasn't about a hundred
years ago that people were
3881.32 measuring bumps on the head as
a way to diagnose phrenology,
3884.47 and that there's still
so much to learn.
3887.09 And so when I hear you say,
adjusting nutrition or putting
3890.29 people into a ketogenic state
or even just eliminating
3892.75 highly processed foods,
sugars, et cetera,
3894.693 taking care of
metabolic syndrome,
3896.11 and then observing
tremendous relief
3898.6 in clinical syndromes of--
3901.75 or symptoms, rather, of
psychiatric disorders,
3904.99 it makes perfect sense to me.
3906.31 It's yet another
dissection tool.
3908.35 And a tool for altering
brain chemistry.
3912.655 If I think about the landscape,
the sort of sociology out there
3915.28 of--
3916.03 again, there seem to be these
bins, like a third of people
3918.94 saying, of course,
diet, and exercise,
3921.04 and social connection,
and limiting
3922.75 stress, that's the good stuff.
3924.77 That's the stuff
that we really works.
3926.54 And then about a third of
people are sort of unclear.
3928.31 And then a third of
people think, well,
3929.935 if it's not a
prescription drug, then
3932.14 it just has no
place in medicine.
3934.36 And hopefully, that's changing.
3936.282 And certainly, the
work that you're doing
3937.99 is going to be important
in that transition
3941.38 that I think we will see.
3943.5 I'd like to talk about mitophagy
and mitochondrial biogenesis.
3949.97 I think most people learn that
the mitochondria are the energy
3954.5 factories of cells and
that indeed, they are.
3957.087 As a neuroscientist,
what I know about
3958.67 them is that they are present
everywhere in neurons.
3960.837 Not just in the
so-called cell body,
3962.64 but you can find mitochondria
in the furthest little bits
3965.93 of neurons.
3966.47 And neurons can be
quite big, very large.
3969.17 In fact, meters long or more
in some cases and some species,
3972.96 including us.
3973.785 Depending on how tall somebody
is, could be many meters--
3976.16 or several meters rather.
3979.45 And that mitochondria do a
lot of stuff besides just
3982.48 produce energy,
because I think people
3984.142 hear "mitochondria," "energy,"
and they think, oh, so
3986.35 these patients felt better.
3987.502 They lost weight.
3988.21 They had more energy.
3989.14 And then they're doing better.
3990.39 But here we're talking
about remission
3992.23 of auditory hallucinations,
people feeling suicidal
3997.48 and then changing their
diet and feeling like life
4000.24 is something they can deal
with, and maybe even function
4002.88 extremely well, and et cetera.
4004.53 So maybe we could just
talk about mitochondria
4006.6 for a moment.
4007.227 And then talk about
these two major effects.
4009.06 What are some of
the other things
4010.53 that mitochondria are important
for in neurons and maybe
4015.45 other cells of the brain?
4016.95 Because as an access
point for all this,
4019.132 I think it would be great
if people could learn
4021.09 a little mitochondrial biology.
4024.96 CHRIS PALMER: So I guess the
first thing that I'll say
4027.21 is that this field is one of
the most cutting-edge fields
4034.67 in medicine right now.
4039.08 20 years ago or so, I think the
majority of research scientists
4043.82 thought of
mitochondria as nothing
4045.59 more than little batteries.
4047.96 They take food and oxygen
and turn it into ATP.
4052.16 And that's really important.
4053.36 Yeah, we get that.
4054.5 But they're just
little batteries.
4056.69 That's all they are.
4059.46 And so one of the reasons
that this work is so important
4066.38 it's because it combines
cutting-edge research
4069.05 in the metabolic field
in the aging field.
4073.46 And we can start to pair
it with a mental health
4077.12 and neurological health field.
4079.44 So mitochondria-- one
scientist gave me this analogy.
4085.96 He said, if you think of
the cell as a computer,
4089.968 a lot of people
think of mitochondria
4091.51 as the power cord
to that computer
4093.34 because they're
providing the power.
4095.02 And they are, in fact, the
power cord to that computer.
4098.819 But actually,
their real function
4100.194 is the motherboard
of that computer.
4102.979 So mitochondria are directing
in allocating resources
4106.899 throughout a cell.
4107.92 That is their primary function.
4110.02 And then they happen to
be powerhouses as well.
4112.939 And so to give some
clear examples,
4116.14 mitochondria play a direct role
in the production, and release,
4121.27 and regulation of some
really key neurotransmitters,
4124.819 including serotonin, dopamine,
glutamate, acetylcholine.
4131.8 Those are pretty powerful
neurotransmitters.
4133.795 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
I would call those--
4135.1 I would consider those the--
4136.353 I know you listed
more than three.
4137.77 But the sort of primary
colors of neurotransmission.
4141.279 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
4142.029 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Any one of
those in excess or deficiency
4146.02 is going to have
profound negative effects
4148.75 on a nervous system.
4149.87 Or it's going to alter the way
that people and animals feel,
4153.52 think, move--
4154.39 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
4155.14 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--remember, et cetera.
4157.359 CHRIS PALMER: So mitochondria
are providing both some
4160.149 of the building
blocks, if you will,
4162.859 for some of those
molecules that are
4165.22 part of the Krebs,
citric acid cycle.
4167.74 Some of the
intermediate products
4170.08 actually go into making
those neurotransmitters.
4172.93 Much more importantly,
mitochondria
4175.21 provide the energy
for the production
4177.37 of those neurotransmitters.
4178.569 And fascinatingly, mitochondria
are directly related
4182.859 to the release of
neurotransmitters.
4185.62 ATP alone is not enough.
4188.439 There have been some research
studies that have actually
4190.84 found that
mitochondria move along
4194.5 the membrane of the synapse
to release batches of vesicles
4200.77 of neurotransmitters, and that
if the mitochondria are removed
4204.97 from the synapse and researchers
flood that cell with ATP,
4211.33 neurotransmitters usually
are not getting released.
4214.9 Mitochondria are
doing other things.
4217.94 We don't entirely even
understand what all they're
4220.78 doing or how they're doing it.
4222.59 But they're doing other things
than just providing the power.
4227.68 Another really
important example is
4229.48 that mitochondria are actually
the primary regulators
4233.89 of epigenetics.
4235.48 If you look at any one factor--
4237.743 so one study actually
found that they're
4239.41 responsible for the
expression of about 60%
4244.12 of the genes in a cell.
4248.98 And mitochondria do
this through a lot
4250.69 of ways that have been known
for years and sometimes decades.
4253.74 So mitochondria are
directly related
4255.76 to the levels of reactive
oxygen species in a cell.
4259.54 They are managing calcium
regulation in cells.
4264.5 And we know that those
things play a role
4266.71 in epigenetic expression.
4268.3 We know the levels of ATP to
ADP or AMP also play a role.
4274.19 And mitochondria are
doing those things.
4276.588 But it turns out,
mitochondria are actually
4278.38 doing much more
sophisticated things
4279.91 than even those in terms
of gene expression.
4282.7 Mitochondria at
least play a role
4285.58 in all of the aspects of
the human stress response.
4290.21 So when humans are
stressed, either
4292.45 physically or
psychologically, there
4296.71 are several things that happen--
4299.23 increased cortisol increased
adrenaline, noradrenaline,
4303.7 inflammation, and gene
expression-- in particular,
4306.91 in the hippocampus-- occur
with the stress response.
4310.75 And one group of
researchers actually
4312.79 genetically modified
mitochondria
4314.71 in four different
ways, and found
4316.27 that all of the stress
response, all those four
4320.32 buckets of stress response were
impacted in one way or another,
4325.33 implying that
mitochondria are somehow
4328.06 playing a role in those.
4330.85 In terms of their
role in cortisol,
4334.0 we know that
mitochondria actually
4335.92 have the enzyme required for the
synthesis of steroid hormones.
4341.51 So that includes cortisol,
estrogen, testosterone,
4345.04 and progesterone, some
names that maybe everybody's
4347.86 heard of.
4350.47 so that means that
if mitochondria
4353.98 are in short supply
or dysfunctional,
4357.46 the production of those hormones
may become dysregulated.
4364.21 Mitochondria play a direct
role in inflammation.
4368.11 And they turn the
inflammatory system both on--
4374.17 or they at least play a role in
turning the inflammatory system
4376.96 both on and off.
4379.24 I'm not going to be able
to quote the exact study
4381.46 and author.
4382.12 But one paper in cell actually
identified mitochondria
4386.44 as the key regulator in turning
certain inflammatory cells off,
4390.73 and that when you inhibit
mitochondrial function,
4393.22 those cells don't turn off,
that mitochondrial levels
4396.91 of reactive oxygen species
are a key signaling process
4402.46 to turn the inflammatory
cell process off.
4406.12 Another study found
that macrophages--
4408.92 so macrophages are an
important immune cell
4412.06 that play a role in healing.
4413.6 So if you cut yourself,
your body will get--
4417.4 send inflammation that way
and send immune cells that way
4422.32 to try to heal your skin.
4424.42 And macrophages play an
important role in that healing.
4427.96 One group of researchers
tried to figure out
4430.6 how do macrophages
know to switch
4433.78 between the different
phases of wound healing
4436.51 because the macrophages
do different things
4439.03 in the different phases
of wound healing.
4441.73 And the conclusion of
all of their research
4444.55 was that it's mitochondria.
4446.29 Mitochondria are sending
the essential signals
4450.1 that change the state
of the macrophages
4453.1 to induce these different
phases of wound healing.
4458.26 So I've just talked about
neurotransmitters, hormones,
4462.49 epigenetic expression,
inflammation.
4467.42 For anybody familiar with
the mental health field,
4471.31 they know these are some of the
key variables that researchers
4477.4 have been struggling with for
decades, trying to figure out
4480.85 how do these fit together.
4482.87 We know that all
of those buckets
4486.1 can be disrupted in people
with mental disorders.
4492.33 And our field has
struggled to understand,
4494.79 but how do they fit together?
4496.72 How can we make sense
of this disruption?
4500.43 And I believe once
you understand
4503.49 the science of mitochondria,
you can actually
4507.77 connect all of the dots of
the mental illness puzzle.
4511.242 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like
to take a brief break
4513.2 and thank our sponsor,
InsideTracker.
4516.11 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
4518.75 that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA
4521.21 to help you better
understand your body
4522.92 and help you reach
your health goals.
4524.72 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
4527.33 for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact
4530.282 your immediate and
long-term health
4531.74 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
4534.307 The problem with a lot of
blood and DNA tests out there,
4536.64 however, is that
you get data back
4538.73 about metabolic factors, lipids,
and hormones, and so forth.
4541.65 But you don't know what
to do with those data.
4543.567 InsideTracker
solves that problem
4545.12 and makes it very easy
for you to understand
4547.31 what sorts of nutritional,
behavioral, maybe even
4550.94 supplementation-based
interventions
4553.19 you might want to
take on in order
4554.87 to adjust the numbers of those
metabolic factors, hormones,
4557.57 lipids, and other
things that impact
4559.25 your immediate and
long-term health to bring
4561.32 those numbers into the
ranges that are appropriate
4563.81 and indeed optimal for you.

4583.22 Super interesting little
subcellular goodies,
4587.12 these mitochondria are.
4590.288 I come from a field where
people are often divided
4593.54 into lumpers and splitters.
4595.19 And I'm somewhere in between.
4598.503 For those of you who
don't know, lumpers
4600.17 are people that like to
make things really simple--
4602.36 lists of no more than three
functions or dividing brain
4605.63 areas into no more than three.
4607.138 Splitters are people
that like to subdivide
4608.93 into a ton of detail.
4611.72 There's a history of scientists
being splitters in order
4614.12 to be able to name things
after themselves because--
4616.43 CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]
4617.45 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
There's more territory
4618.38 to go around if you're splitting
than if you're lumping.
4620.87 But we are doing neither here.
4622.55 What I'm hearing is that
mitochondria, in addition
4627.23 to being important sources of
energy production and output
4630.59 in cells--
4631.46 which, of course, they are--
4633.644 probably have other roles.
4637.22 Maybe someday, what we call
mitochondria will actually
4641.3 be two or three different little
subcellular or organelles.
4643.85 There may be little
bits in there
4644.96 that are controlling gene
expression and little bits
4647.127 in there that are controlling
neurotransmitter production.
4649.7 But at least for now,
the name is mitochondria.
4652.16 And thank you, by the
way, for illustrating
4654.56 some of the other things
that they do because
4657.68 in the landscape of
science education,
4660.23 oftentimes, people will
think, OK, energy production.
4662.737 There'll be a picture or
a cartoon of mitochondria
4664.82 flexing its muscles.
4665.98 People go, OK,
energy, mitochondria,
4667.73 mighty mitochondria.
4668.63 And then they'll
think, oh, they're
4670.088 just sort of like a dumb
jock portion of the cell.
4673.07 They're not doing
anything sophisticated.
4674.96 And everything you
listed off is that they
4676.73 are doing many sophisticated
intricate things within cells.
4681.27 So I think how things are
cartooned and discussed
4683.84 actually has an impact-- and
not just on the general public,
4686.72 but on the medical field
and on the science fields.
4689.24 Anyway, that's more
science sociology.
4691.07 But now that everyone
is well aware
4694.28 that mitochondria are doing a
large number of very important
4697.79 things in a very regulated way,
let's talk about mitophagy.
4702.08 A few years ago, because a Nobel
Prize was given for autophagy--
4706.16 sometimes called autophagy.
4707.9 Look, people, you can
say it either way.
4709.58 People will know hopefully what
it means is more important,
4712.44 which is the gobbling
up of one's own cells
4715.31 that are dead or injured.
4718.7 And this idea of
autophagy, of cells
4723.2 being eaten up within a system--
4726.23 nervous system or other system--
4728.36 has come up again and again.
4730.16 I actually wasn't aware
that mitophagy could
4733.1 be such an important lever.
4734.72 So tell us about mitophagy,
which I have to presume
4737.18 is the, intentional or not,
gobbling up of mitochondria,
4743.6 presumably to replace them with
newer healthier mitochondria.
4746.24 Is that right?
4746.72 CHRIS PALMER: It is.
4747.553 So in many ways, mitophagy
is a subset of autophagy.
4752.99 But it's got its
own name because it
4755.75 is specific to mitochondria.
4758.18 There do appear to be some
unique regulators of mitophagy
4764.33 compared to autophagy
more broadly.
4767.27 Mitochondria actually are
playing a role in autophagy
4770.96 itself.
4773.0 And this makes sense because
one of-- so the global picture
4776.69 of autophagy is stimulated
by fasting states
4781.34 or fasting-mimicking states.
4783.47 So when your body senses that
you don't have enough food,
4789.53 it actually hunkers
down and starts
4792.95 to recycle dead old parts
in this kind of carefully
4801.35 orchestrated way.
4802.88 And it takes them to lysosomes.
4805.22 They get degraded.
4806.18 And then those
degradation products
4809.42 get used for either energy
or to build new things.
4813.35 Autophagy is always
occurring at a low level.
4817.4 But you can really
hyperstimulate the process
4820.67 through fasting,
calorie restriction,
4823.16 fasting-mimicking
diets, other things.
4825.69 And this is why fasting
and calorie restriction
4828.68 is so kind of such hot topics
in the medical field now.
4832.55 It's because they've been
shown to induce longevity.
4836.12 And we think it's probably
through that process
4839.03 that you're stimulating
the body to kind of become
4846.41 lean and conservative in terms
of its allocation of resources.
4853.4 And the body doesn't just
destroy the healthiest tissue
4856.7 along with the old dead stuff.
4858.32 It has these processes that
identify the old and defective
4861.89 parts first.
4862.88 And they go first.
4864.11 And that's what's beautiful
about the whole thing.
4866.67 And that's why fasting
is so important.
4869.52 So mitophagy we know plays a
really important role because--
4878.9 so there's this term called
mitochondrial dysfunction,
4882.885 which some researchers are
actually wanting to get rid of
4885.26 and move away from
because, as you just said,
4887.87 mitochondria do so
many different things.
4889.91 And different mitochondria
even within the same cell
4892.58 may very well be specializing
in different tasks.
4895.67 And mitochondria from
one cell to another
4897.56 are sometimes doing
very different things,
4899.91 like not all mitochondria
can produce cortisol.
4903.02 That's specific
to specific cells
4907.22 where those genes are
getting turned on.
4909.66 So it's not like
all mitochondria
4911.21 are producing cortisol.
4912.32 Just the ones in your
adrenal gland, for instance,
4915.5 are producing cortisol.
4918.53 But there is this term
"mitochondrial dysfunction."
4921.8 And it has long been
known, for decades,
4926.48 that mitochondrial dysfunction
is associated with everything
4931.61 that ails us essentially.
4934.6 So in the 1950s, we
had a theory of aging
4941.66 that was based on
reactive oxygen species.
4946.4 And that's where all
the inflammation is bad
4948.32 for you comes from.
4949.34 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And where all
the noise about antioxidants--
4954.77 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
4955.58 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Like in the '90s,
4956.51 it was like, it
contains antioxidants.
4958.25 Not to say antioxidants are
bad, but they are certainly not
4960.8 the be-all-end-all of health.
4962.055 CHRIS PALMER: They are not.
4963.18 But that's exactly where
that research came from,
4965.81 is that researchers
were narrowing
4968.27 in on these reactive oxygen
species are highly, highly
4972.02 correlated with all of
the diseases of aging
4976.4 and poor health outcomes.
4978.68 It turns out, they're also
highly, highly correlated
4981.68 with all chronic mental
disorders interestingly.
4987.12 So researchers used
the antioxidants
4989.31 to see if, well,
maybe if we can stop,
4991.92 somehow tame these
reactive oxygen species,
4994.3 we'll improve health outcomes.
4995.55 Doesn't seem to work.
4996.93 By the 1970s, our
understanding of mitochondria
5000.41 and their role in the production
of reactive oxygen species
5003.08 expanded.
5003.86 And that led to the
mitochondrial theory of aging.
5006.95 So in the 1970s, we had this
mitochondrial theory of aging,
5010.37 based primarily and exclusively
on reactive oxygen species.
5015.77 Fast forward a
couple of decades,
5017.39 that was disproven
because we now reactive
5019.76 oxygen species aren't all bad.
5021.71 They actually serve
a signaling process.
5024.02 They're a normal part
of human functioning
5026.36 and cellular function.
5028.02 So they're not all bad.
5030.03 But we still know high levels
of reactive oxygen species
5033.53 are bad for you.
5035.12 Fast forward to just, I
think, maybe last year,
5039.32 with this expanded role of
all of the different things
5042.08 mitochondria are doing.
5043.67 So David Sinclair
published a paper
5047.48 in one of the cell
journals, I think,
5050.21 saying that, oh,
mitochondria are actually
5053.3 the unifying link of everything
that we know about aging.
5057.11 Mitochondria are the cause--
5059.66 or defective mitochondria
or defective mitochondrial
5062.63 function, mitochondrial
dysfunction,
5065.39 is possibly the
unifying cause of aging
5070.1 and all of the aging
related disorders.
5074.38 So mitophagy is trying
to address all that.
5078.88 It's trying to say,
OK, this is bad.
5080.84 We don't want defective
mitochondria and how can
5083.44 we get rid of old
ones or defective ones
5086.935 and replace them with new ones.
5089.32 And I think the most
powerful signal and tool
5096.15 that we have right now is,
in fact, related to diet.
5101.77 It's calorie restriction.
5103.54 That is the oldest, truest, kind
of best-proven way to prevent
5111.34 aging in a wide variety
of animal species--
5115.0 fasting and
intermittent fasting.
5117.94 And again, you can only do
those things for so long.
5121.03 And then fasting-mimicking
diets can also
5125.23 stimulate this
process of mitophagy.
5128.98 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Before we talk
about mitochondrial biogenesis,
5133.33 if--
5134.71 and I certainly accept
the idea that mitochondria
5138.01 are extremely important
in physical health
5140.41 and mental health.
5141.37 That's, for me, is a
straightforward conclusion
5144.94 at this point, based
on what you've said,
5146.84 whatever and
elsewhere, et cetera.
5150.56 And if various diets, including
ketogenic diet, including
5155.11 fasting, reducing sugar
intake, et cetera,
5158.2 can assist in mitochondrial
function and mitophagy--
5161.83 and that's at least one of
the levers by which diet
5165.25 can positively impact mental
health and physical health,
5170.01 can we conclude that
there's something special
5173.01 about low blood
glucose in the brain?
5176.995 The sort of common pathway of
all of those things-- fasting,
5180.03 ketogenesis--
5181.71 for some people, maybe they--
5183.27 maybe some people have
great insulin management,
5186.21 so just removing
sweets, refined sugars,
5190.66 brings down their blood
glucose level substantially.
5192.9 They don't need to go
on a ketogenic diet
5194.37 in order to relieve a
low level depression
5196.132 or something like that.
5197.09 Seems like the
common theme here is
5199.62 that glucose levels
in the brain need
5202.46 to be reduced, which
for me, is surprising
5207.17 because neurons love glucose.
5210.392 There are some
really nice studies.
5211.85 One that I can think
of recently that
5213.44 was published in
Neuron, if you just
5214.94 look at the tuning of a neuron,
how well a neuron in the brain
5218.75 represents some visual image
in the environment in terms--
5222.578 here, we can just
generalize and say,
5224.12 more action potentials,
more electrical signals
5226.43 from the neuron
generally correlates
5227.93 with better high
fidelity representation.
5230.63 It's sort of if everyone's
time someone says, shout,
5233.792 and then someone
shouts, the neuron
5235.25 is the one responding
to the order.
5237.83 And these neurons just,
when there's high glucose,
5240.14 they are faithful
representatives
5242.48 of what's out
there in the world.
5244.28 But then when you
fast an animal,
5246.2 they become less
faithful representatives
5248.24 of what's out there.
5249.38 And yet when I've done
intermittent fasting,
5251.78 and I do a kind of
modified version of it,
5253.67 my mental clarity is
far better than when
5255.59 I've had a big bowl of pasta--
5257.15 probably for other
reasons related
5259.37 to serotonin and tryptophan.
5261.65 So I think for the typical
listener out there,
5264.932 I have to imagine, it's got
to be a little confusing.
5267.14 We hear neurons love glucose.
5268.94 They live on glucose.
5270.89 And here, we're saying, let's
deprive them of some glucose.
5274.04 Or let's just bring
glucose levels down.
5276.17 Or let's switch the fuel source
of the brain from glucose
5279.29 to ketones.
5280.7 And now the brain really works
the way it's supposed to.
5283.98 So this raises a little bit
of just so story question,
5286.55 like why would it be the case
that neurons love glucose,
5291.56 and yet if there's too
much glucose around,
5293.6 they become sick?
5295.76 And of course, with any
why-would-it-be story,
5299.54 as I would say, I wasn't
consulted at the design phase.
5302.005 And I'm going to
presume that you
5303.38 weren't consulted the design--
5304.4 CHRIS PALMER: I was not.
5304.76 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either.
5305.6 And that if any of
us say that we are,
5307.183 then we are probably the
patients that need evaluation.
5309.78 So I think there's
a name for that.
5311.255 There's delusion--
5312.005 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
5312.26 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right?
5312.53 OK.
5313.03 I threw out my first correct
clinical assessment of myself.
5315.98 So how do I get my
head around this?
5320.09 You've got me sold
on mitochondria--
5321.702 not that I needed to be sold.
5322.91 But that's an easy yes,
yes, absolutely, yes.
5326.0 The idea that diet can
impact mental health
5327.89 and physical health--
yes, absolutely--
5329.63 by way of mitochondria--
at least in part, great.
5333.23 But then neurons love glucose.
5335.39 So what's going on?
5336.98 Or what do you
think is going on?
5340.63 CHRIS PALMER: I am not convinced
that glucose is the real story.
5352.21 Glucose may, in
fact, be a symptom.
5358.26 We know that parts
of the brain--
5360.84 there have been a couple of
studies that just came out
5363.09 in the last couple
of weeks, I think,
5365.91 documenting that actually
astrocytes in the hypothalamus
5372.09 play a key role in glucose
regulation throughout the body.
5379.68 And it appears to be a metabolic
role, which in my mind,
5385.74 implies that the mitochondria
in those astrocytes
5389.13 are probably playing a key role
because we know mitochondria
5393.0 play a key role in
sensing glucose levels.
5397.11 They play a key role in
the release of insulin
5401.22 from the pancreas.
5403.89 But mitochondria in
the brain is also
5408.18 playing a role in
kind of balancing
5411.72 how much glucose is around.
5415.0 And so it's a difficult question
because I think in some cases,
5422.55 high glucose levels
are actually a symptom
5427.02 of metabolic dysfunction
somewhere in the body or brain.
5431.65 And when I think about,
well, what does that mean?
5436.97 In my mind, most of
the evidence currently
5440.66 is pointing to
mitochondrial dysfunction
5443.99 somewhere in the body or brain.
5447.5 That is the most likely
cause of that dysregulation
5451.58 of glucose levels.
5455.74 But we know that if you
consume massive amounts
5461.29 of junk food, sugar,
and other things,
5465.01 that you can get dysregulation
of glucose levels.
5473.05 The conundrum, though,
is that that's not
5475.5 a universal response.
5477.035 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what
about the typical person?
5479.16 I've never really liked
junk food that much.
5481.11 Maybe as a kid, I can
recall liking candy.
5483.51 But I was a sandwich for
lunch person for a long time.
5487.24 And as I've changed
that out for salad
5490.26 and maybe a small piece of
meat with my salad or something
5494.07 like that, I feel far better
during the day, far more alert.
5496.71 But I do eat carbohydrates.
5497.843 I eat starches
typically at night.
5499.26 But I tend to do some very
hard training at some point
5502.08 during the day.
5502.8 So I imagine I have
some glycogen to repack.
5505.24 OK.
5505.74 That's me.
5506.43 I only mentioned that
because I'm not in ketosis
5509.76 as far as I know.
5510.48 I haven't-- unless you
brought the strips,
5512.37 I haven't done the blood
glucose test today.
5516.82 So what about the
typical person who's
5519.06 an omnivore eating some
rice, some pasta, pasta
5524.46 salads, people that are eating
not junk food massive amounts
5529.11 of sugar but have
blood glucose that's
5531.57 in kind of moderate range?
5533.49 Do you think-- and here,
feel free to speculate.
5536.43 Do you think that those
people might feel far better--
5540.75 or even a little
bit better-- if they
5542.52 were in a lower glucose state?
5546.79 And I ask this
because I think there
5548.993 are a lot of people
out there who suffer
5550.66 from full-blown depression.
5551.95 But there are also
a lot of people
5553.367 who suffer from moodiness
and feeling not so great,
5556.84 subclinical depression.
5558.285 CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout
is what I would call it.
5560.41 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, or just
feeling some days are great,
5562.9 and then other days, they
feel lousy for reasons
5565.27 they don't understand.
5566.35 CHRIS PALMER: Yeah.
5567.43 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And those make
for less dramatic case studies.
5570.13 And yet I have to assume
that that description will
5573.28 net a large fraction
of the general public.
5577.77 CHRIS PALMER: So the way that
I kind of break this field--
5582.23 and I'm probably getting
too nerdy right now.
5584.33 But I kind of break
this field into cause--
5588.01 what's the actual root cause--
5591.04 and what are
effective treatments.
5594.4 And I really see them
as two separate things.
5597.94 Just because the ketogenic
diet is an effective treatment,
5603.01 does not imply that the
cause of the problem
5606.46 was eating carbohydrates.
5608.98 And I think that's a really
important distinction.
5612.29 There are many people who
disagree with me on that.
5614.62 There's no doubt about it.
5615.95 And everybody's
heard people say,
5617.74 sugar is the cause of
everything that ails you.
5620.56 Or carbs are the cause of
everything that ails you.
5622.87 If everybody does a low carb
diet or a ketogenic diet--
5626.17 and then they go to, so it must
be sugar that was the cause.
5631.69 I don't see it as clearly
black and white as that.
5637.66 Calorie restriction,
ketogenic diet,
5641.26 carbohydrate restriction are
inducing metabolic changes
5646.84 in the brain and body.
5649.48 And regardless of what
the person was eating,
5654.16 they are inducing
metabolic changes
5656.44 that can be really
beneficial to brain health.
5659.98 So let me just give a clear
black and white example
5662.95 of this.
5664.12 And then I can speak
to the broader topic
5666.49 that you brought up about
just the general population.
5669.55 The easy example of
the ketogenic diet
5672.31 being an effective
intervention for somebody
5675.22 who was not following a bad
diet is an infant with epilepsy.
5680.5 There are lots of infants who
have uncontrollable seizures.
5684.82 They are drinking breast milk.
5687.28 To the best of our
knowledge, that
5688.9 is the primary, most
beneficial food source
5693.34 an infant could be consuming.
5697.28 Now, some might say, well,
maybe the mother is--
5699.97 whatever, I don't buy that.
5702.41 The mother's breast milk is, in
fact, the optimal food source
5707.233 for that infant.
5707.9 And yet that infant
is still seizing.
5710.3 If we put that infant
on a ketogenic diet,
5712.73 a lot of those infants
seizures will stop.
5715.94 It doesn't mean that the
cause of the infant seizures
5719.21 was a bad diet.
5720.77 But it means that
dietary intervention
5723.23 can change brain metabolism
and improve symptoms
5727.43 in that person.
5729.81 So going to your broader
question about adults,
5732.53 modern-day, the real
answer is-- there was just
5737.61 this conference in
London, the Royal
5741.45 College of obesity medicine
or something like that.
5744.847 That's not the name.
5745.68 But it's something
along those lines.
5748.02 The conclusion of
that conference
5752.83 that invited the greatest
minds in obesity medicine,
5756.37 the overarching conclusion
of that conference was we
5759.22 don't know what causes obesity.
5765.49 It's really important
that we sit with that.
5768.47 We don't know what
causes obesity.
5770.455 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
They don't think
5771.83 excess caloric intake beyond
one's daily metabolic needs
5776.24 is causing obesity?
5778.68 CHRIS PALMER: Some
will argue that.
5780.75 And so some will say yes,
it's all energy balance.
5784.67 But why do we have an
epidemic of obesity?
5786.837 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
5787.67 Well, that's the
N-gazillion dollar question.
5791.735 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
5793.85 Some will say, it's
all the junk food.
5795.44 But we had junk
food in the 1970s.
5797.51 When I was growing up, I grew
up on Kool-Aid, and Twinkies,
5801.23 and King Dons, and HoHos, and--
5803.69 [LAUGHS]
5804.548 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm rewatching
the Mad Men series now.
5806.84 I love that series,
and I'm rewatching it.
5808.59 And I happen to know someone
who worked on that series.
5811.4 They researched
everything for the props,
5813.588 and the costumes, everything,
right down to diet.
5815.63 And if you look at the
diet, it was terrible.
5817.91 It was mostly--
yes, there was a lot
5819.41 of excessive amounts of
drinking and cigarette smoking.
5821.72 But the diets were terrible.
5823.67 It was pre-packaged foods.
5825.29 It was frozen dinners.
5826.97 That really came to prominence
in the '70s and '80s.
5829.88 But even in the '50s and, from
what I've been reading, even
5834.5 in the '30s and
'40s, people were not
5838.46 eating grass-fed
meat and Brazil nuts
5841.22 with a little bit of
broccoli rabe on the side.
5843.95 That's not the typical intake.
5847.13 So something out there--
or maybe multiple things--
5850.73 are at play to increase obesity.
5853.82 CHRIS PALMER: And at the
end of the day, I believe--
5858.3 some will call this speculative.
5859.92 But I actually think we've got
a tremendous amount of evidence
5862.62 that continues to point
in this direction.
5865.38 I believe that
mitochondria are the key
5867.99 to the obesity
epidemic, that there is
5870.87 something in our environment.
5874.51 So that is either our food,
environmental toxins, stress
5879.63 levels, poor sleep, not getting
adequate sunlight, whatever
5884.7 you want to speculate on, all of
the above, all of those things
5890.96 are known to impair
mitochondrial function.
5895.07 And if parts of your brain that
regulate metabolism and that
5901.19 regulate eating behaviors are
not metabolically healthy,
5907.1 it means that they will
not stop you from eating.
5910.64 Or it means that your
metabolism will not
5913.37 rise to the challenge
of 10 donuts,
5918.23 because some people
can eat 10 donuts
5920.15 and go on staying
thin and healthy.
5923.185 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I totally agree.
5924.56 Although, I would
just like to say
5926.6 that it seems to me that
compared to when I was growing
5929.123 up-- and again, I haven't
run the statistics--
5931.04 there are fewer and fewer of
those individuals around now.
5933.8 Just as when I was growing up,
it was one or two kids in class
5938.39 that were quite overweight.
5940.34 And then there were some
that were mildly overweight.
5942.77 But most were of healthy weight.
5946.29 Nowadays, that's
dramatically altered.
5948.6 The landscape is dramatically
altered in the other direction.
5953.1 It is rare when I encounter one
of those can-eat-anything type
5956.56 people.
5957.06 I know one, he's actually
an employee at Stanford.
5959.05 He's in our media
team at Stanford.
5960.508 And this guy, when I take
him to lunch, it's like--
5964.18 he's in his early
70s, and he can eat.
5967.0 And he's incredibly lean.
5968.137 He exercises a little bit.
5969.22 But he's one of these mutants
that just can eat, and eat,
5973.99 and eat, and he's lean
and he's vital, and he's--
5976.975 it's wild.
5978.79 And he's an expensive lunch.
5980.62 CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]
5982.36 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But those
people are seem rare.
5985.22 And even those kids
are now seem rare.
5987.57 CHRIS PALMER: They're
getting increasingly rare.
5989.57 And that leads me
to think it may
5991.67 be epigenetic factors
in the womb environment,
5995.64 so that kids are actually coming
out predisposed to obesity.
5999.268 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
let me ask you about
6001.06 that because I had a note
here to ask this later.
6003.04 But I'm going to
interrupt you now in order
6004.832 to capture this moment.
6006.52 My understanding is that--
6008.8 well, as everyone
knows, we inherit DNA.
6010.63 We get genes from
both of our parents.
6012.34 And they mix.
6012.94 Although there are incredible
data from Catherine Dulac's
6015.79 lab at Harvard and others
showing that we actually
6018.28 have entire regions
of our brain that
6020.26 carry neurons that are of
purely of mom's or of dad's DNA,
6026.51 depending on the brain region.
6027.76 This is a wild finding.
6029.5 But it's accurate.
6030.715 And this has actually been known
about in terms of heritability
6033.34 of disease, et cetera.
6036.34 Maternal DNA, DNA from mom,
genes from our mother--
6040.75 not to place blame
on mothers at all.
6044.14 My understanding is that
the mitochondrial DNA
6046.32 come exclusively through
the maternal side.
6048.81 Is that true?
6050.165 CHRIS PALMER: So it's
a great question.
6051.79 And I've been asked this before.
6053.123 And yeah, psychiatrists are
known for blaming mothers.
6056.16 And some might say that I'm
trying to redo that whole thing
6059.85 and blame mothers again.
6061.735 ANDREW HUBERMAN: The
data are the data.
6063.36 I'm not trying to
blame mothers here.
6064.902 Mothers play an essential
role in everything.
6068.89 But if it is true
that mitochondria
6071.97 are the linchpin of all this and
maternal DNA is what determines
6074.79 the mitochondrial DNA, I
think it's an important place
6077.04 to look.
6077.43 CHRIS PALMER: It's an
important question.
6079.138 And the answer is
unequivocally no.
6081.48 That's not the way it works.
6082.65 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
then vindication for anyone
6084.75 that was asserting that.
6085.81 CHRIS PALMER: And so
let me explain it.
6087.435 So mitochondria have 36
genes unto themselves.
6091.05 13 of those genes code for some
of the mitochondrial machinery
6095.28 of making ATP.
6096.51 And the other 36 play roles
in epigenetic regulation,
6101.82 play roles in whole body
metabolism, and other things.
6105.84 So that is what you're
inheriting from your mom.
6108.72 It's the mitochondria and those
36 genes for the most part.
6114.24 But the majority of proteins
that make up mitochondria,
6119.49 over, I think, 1,300 genes
that make up mitochondria
6123.18 are actually encoded
in the nuclear DNA.
6126.84 And so you inherit a copy
from both your mother
6129.81 and your father.
6131.01 So the majority of people who
have mitochondrial defects
6134.64 or rare mitochondrial
diseases actually
6139.05 could inherit them
from either mom or dad
6142.47 because it can be a defect in
the nuclear genes that code
6148.59 for proteins that
make up mitochondria.
6152.11 The much bigger issue when--
6154.54 so when I talk about
mitochondrial dysfunction
6158.11 being a primary driver of mental
illness, metabolic illness,
6165.08 it's not that people inherit
a defective mitochondrion
6170.12 or mitochondria
from mom, and then
6173.84 that just ruins
their life forever.
6176.09 That's actually not
the way it works.
6178.53 The beautiful thing
about this theory
6182.06 is that it connects
all of the risk factors
6185.12 that we already know play
a role in mental health
6189.9 but also metabolic health.
6192.21 Sleep disruption impairs
mitochondria and mitochondrial
6196.59 function.
6197.67 Stress, high levels
of stress and trauma,
6200.37 impair mitochondrial function.
6202.65 Drug and alcohol use,
alcohol, tobacco definitely--
6208.65 in terms of the smoke--
6210.15 and marijuana-- THC, in
particular-- all impair
6214.53 mitochondrial function.
6215.88 ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly or the smoke?
6219.48 CHRIS PALMER: THC directly.
6220.83 Those studies have been done.
6224.07 So mitochondria actually have
CB1 receptors right on them.
6229.17 And various
researchers, a couple
6232.92 of studies from Nature
actually documented
6235.92 this, that the mitochondrial
CB1 receptors are primary--
6244.74 kind of primary points of
the influence of marijuana
6248.64 on human behaviors and effects.
6253.44 Because when they remove CB1
receptors in animal models,
6257.69 these changes don't happen.
6260.04 So the CB1 receptors--
6263.28 we've got some large
studies of adolescents
6265.86 who use a lot of marijuana.
6267.57 And the areas where the
mitochondria have the greatest
6270.87 number of CB1 receptors
are areas of their brains
6274.5 that actually are atrophied
or shrunk compared
6279.18 to normal healthy controls.
6280.96 So that means their brain
tissue is aging prematurely.
6283.92 It's shrinking prematurely.
6287.49 But the CB1 receptors
on mitochondria
6290.19 also seem to play a role in
the memory impairment that
6293.22 can be induced from THC.
6296.97 And they also play
a role in the kind
6301.17 of lack of motivation, the
behavioral amotivational state
6305.76 from THC.
6307.56 Now, again, for people
who want to chillax,
6311.22 that's what they're looking for.
6312.99 They don't want to
remember anything.
6314.76 They don't want to think.
6316.98 They want to be spaced out.
6318.57 They want to relax.
6320.4 That's great.
6322.92 But it's important
that they know
6324.63 that they're actually harming
the mitochondria in their brain
6327.81 cells.
6329.76 And that although there's
always an opportunity
6334.14 to repair mitochondria
and always an opportunity
6337.02 to stimulate
mitochondrial biogenesis,
6339.31 so you can get it back, but if
you keep doing it chronically,
6342.57 you're probably not helping
your overall mental or metabolic
6346.58 health.
6347.08 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'm
glad you brought up THC.
6348.6 We did an episode on cannabis.
6349.92 We also did one on alcohol--
6351.69 probably lost some
friends from that one.
6354.158 When you look at the
data, it's very clear.
6355.95 I'm not arguing
that people dislike
6358.56 the effects of these
compounds when they take them.
6361.98 But it is clear
that, at least to me,
6365.19 based on the data that
regardless of what people
6367.26 have read about red wine, that
not drinking any alcohol is
6369.747 going to be healthier
than drinking alcohol,
6371.58 and that the thresholds for
alcohol ingestion before people
6374.13 start to negatively
impact their health
6375.755 is about one or two per week.
6377.4 And then THC, because of
the very high concentrations
6380.01 of THC that are present
in a lot of products now--
6383.09 vaping and smoking
THC and even edibles--
6386.0 that it can be problematic.
6388.115 You mentioned adolescents
that predisposition,
6390.65 and brain atrophy,
psychosis, et cetera.
6392.93 In any case, because
you mentioned alcohol
6396.35 because it is a
commonly used substance,
6400.34 I heard you give
a talk in which--
6402.59 I think I have this right--
in which alcohol can disrupt
6408.25 the way that the brain
uses fuels of all kinds,
6412.49 which may disrupt one's
response to alcohol,
6418.0 make alcohol seem more rewarding
to those that drink alcohol.
6423.915 So drinking alcohol
makes alcohol
6425.29 more rewarding to the
brains of alcohol drinkers,
6429.76 but that it also might
alter glucose metabolism,
6432.67 that basically alcohol is
not good for our brains.
6436.84 Do I have that correct?
6437.86 CHRIS PALMER: You do
have that correct.
6439.485 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
6441.23 What happens if you take an
alcoholic or somebody that just
6444.71 drinks two to four
nights a week a couple
6448.28 of drinks, which I think
is pretty common out there,
6451.28 and you put them on
a ketogenic diet?
6453.68 Has that experiment been done?
6455.27 CHRIS PALMER: That
experiment has been done.
6457.103 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah.
6458.653 CHRIS PALMER: It
led by none other
6460.07 than a woman named
Nora Volkow, who
6462.32 is one of the leading
neuroscientists and addiction
6466.25 researchers in the world.
6467.76 She is the director of
the National Institute
6469.85 of Drug Abuse.
6471.14 She's been hot on the trail
of metabolic abnormalities
6474.86 in the brains of people with
alcohol use disorder, which
6478.01 I will just refer
to as alcoholics
6480.17 because that's what
everybody knows it as.
6482.96 So she's been hot on this
trail for many, many years.
6487.79 And as you said, it turns
out that the reward pathways,
6493.67 in particular, are metabolically
compromised in alcoholics.
6497.75 And the metabolic compromise
essentially, in a nutshell,
6500.57 means they aren't getting
enough fuel from glucose.
6503.99 The interesting thing is that
when people drink alcohol,
6507.89 your liver converts alcohol
into a molecule called acetate.
6512.15 That acetate travels up to the
brain and fuels brain cells,
6516.98 in particular, some
of these reward
6518.75 pathway cells more than others.
6521.04 And so chronic alcoholics
have this chronic deprivation
6527.0 of energy in these cells.
6529.59 And so Nora Volkow and other
researchers at the National
6532.94 Institutes of Health did a
study in which they set out
6538.58 to see if we can change
this brain metabolic problem
6543.32 in alcoholics.
6544.79 Will that affect clinical
symptoms of alcoholism?
6548.66 And will it do anything?
6551.255 It's clinically useful.
6553.41 And so they actually
did a pilot randomized
6557.51 controlled trial, admitted
alcoholics to a detox unit.
6562.02 Half of the patients
got a ketogenic diet.
6564.5 The other half got the
standard American diet.
6567.26 And then everybody
else, all of them
6569.21 got the same detox protocol.
6571.98 The patients who got
the ketogenic diet
6575.37 required fewer benzodiazepines
for their detox.
6580.14 Despite that, they had
fewer withdrawal symptoms
6584.4 from the alcohol.
6585.99 They reported fewer
cravings for alcohol.
6590.49 And the researchers
did brain scans,
6593.11 which showed improved brain
metabolism in these key areas
6598.02 that they were looking at.
6600.39 And their brains
showed reduced levels
6603.51 of neuroinflammation,
which was also something
6606.84 they were really interested in.
6609.19 And so that one study says to
us that even though most people
6616.38 would think alcoholism has
nothing to do with diet,
6619.8 alcohol is just
drinking too much.
6622.08 It's a matter of willpower.
6624.18 Or it's somebody
who's addictive.
6625.67 They've got an
addictive personality,
6627.81 and it's that simple.
6629.38 You come out of the womb with
an addictive personality.
6632.31 And those people are novelty
seekers, and they're impulsive.
6637.89 And they have no patience.
6639.42 They have no discipline.
6640.71 They can't sustain any kind
of rewarding experience.
6645.45 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or
childhood trauma.
6647.67 There's a--
6648.21 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
6648.63 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --story there,
which there very well may be.
6651.15 But--
6651.54 CHRIS PALMER: And there may be.
6652.38 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
6653.58 CHRIS PALMER: But what that
research study strongly
6656.52 suggests--
6657.81 and again, yes, maybe we need
larger controlled trials.
6661.29 But this is one of the leading
neuroscientists in the world
6663.78 who's hot on this trail.
6664.83 This is what she believes.
6666.09 And this is what I believe.
6668.25 It's that if we can correct
the brain metabolic defects
6671.82 from chronic alcohol
use, we might
6674.49 be able to help people be
sober and give them a fighting
6679.11 chance.
6679.68 Or give them an edge
up or pull a lever
6682.98 that we can use in their
favor, for their benefit.
6687.66 There's one caution to
all of this research
6689.58 that I really do
want to highlight.
6691.3 And so now, I'm going
to get hate mail
6693.24 from all the keto community.
6695.34 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's OK.
6696.81 I admire you for talking
about nutrition at all
6698.97 because anytime one
talks about nutrition,
6701.58 you're going to get
hate mail from somebody.
6704.52 CHRIS PALMER: So the
caveat to all of this
6707.91 is that as part of the research
that those researchers were
6712.77 doing, they actually
wanted to see
6715.26 what will happen
to alcohol levels
6719.64 if an animal consumes alcohol
while on a ketogenic diet.
6726.1 So they didn't do
this in humans yet.
6728.22 This is a fairly
easy study to do.
6730.29 So I'm hoping somebody
will do this study soon.
6732.87 But they instead put
rats half of them
6736.44 on a standard diet and half
of them on a ketogenic diet.
6739.175 And then they exposed them
to the exact same amount
6741.3 of alcohol.
6742.8 The rats who were on
the ketogenic diet
6745.11 had a five-fold increase
in blood alcohol levels.
6749.84 Five-fold increase.
6750.82 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Meaning, they drank more?
6752.57 Or--
6752.9 CHRIS PALMER: No.
6753.11 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it was
metabolized differently.
6754.73 CHRIS PALMER: It was
metabolized differently.
6756.605 The rats all got the
same amount of alcohol.
6759.3 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for people
out there who are ketogenic,
6762.59 I'm chuckling, but who are
not alcoholics-- please,
6764.763 alcoholics, please
do something about it
6766.43 because it's so detrimental.
6767.597 But I guess does this mean that
they can drink less in order
6770.66 to get the effect of alcohol
that most people are seeking?
6773.3 CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates.
6774.56 Cheap date is what
you call that.
6776.3 You only need a half a drink
instead of three drinks.
6778.858 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I would think
the keto community would thank
6781.4 you for this unless they somehow
have a stake in the alcohol
6784.67 industry.
6787.047 CHRIS PALMER: The
reason that I put it
6788.63 as a caution is that if anybody
is struggling with alcoholism
6792.32 and thinks hey, I
need an edge up.
6794.33 I need a lever to pull
because I'm really struggling
6796.94 to give this stuff up.
6798.47 I just find myself going back.
6800.27 And if you're telling me my
brain metabolism is messed up,
6803.39 and this might help it,
I'm all in favor of that.
6807.56 And yes, that's what the
researchers are pursuing.
6809.9 And that's what I'm saying
with the following caveat--
6814.07 that if you relapse while
on a ketogenic diet,
6817.7 you better not drink the
same amount of alcohol
6820.4 that you think you can drink.
6822.99 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It could be deadly.
6824.49 CHRIS PALMER: It
could be deadly,
6826.01 and/or it could be really--
6828.41 yeah, deadly to you or someone
else because unfortunately,
6831.47 a lot of times
when people drink,
6833.21 they get behind the wheel.
6834.8 And they think that they can
handle two drinks safely.
6838.28 And they think, well,
I can go out for dinner
6840.83 and have two glasses of
wine and drive home safely.
6844.1 I know myself.
6845.48 If you go to a
ketogenic diet, please
6848.93 don't drive with
the same two drinks
6851.54 because it means your
blood alcohol level--
6854.36 if it models anything that
we found in the rat study--
6858.08 your blood alcohol levels
may be five times higher
6860.72 than they would normally be.
6862.32 And that means you
are really wasted.
6865.13 And you're probably
not safe to be driving.
6866.922 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Probably the same
6868.338 is true for drinking on
an empty stomach, right?
6870.35 CHRIS PALMER: Yup.
6870.62 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
6871.537 Now, it's a very
important point.
6872.96 And thank you for raising that.
6875.21 I hear this again
about mitochondria,
6880.97 about blood glucose, you
mentioned astrocytes.
6884.09 And for those of you--
6885.65 that earlier astrocytes
are a non-neuron cell type
6888.83 in the brain, a glial cell type
that my postdoc advisor was
6893.6 known for popularizing the
modern science of glia,
6896.638 which include astrocytes.
6897.68 And I'd be remiss if I didn't
say that they are considered
6902.27 the cells that hold everything
together in the brain
6904.64 and are kind of
passive observers.
6906.29 But they do many
things actively.
6909.41 I think now people appreciate
the astrocytes at least
6913.04 as important as the neurons.
6915.07 And certainly, for
disease, they are often
6916.82 implicated in warding off
of disease, et cetera.
6920.76 Everything that you're
telling me about the fact
6922.76 that the brain can regulate
things that are happening
6924.98 in the body, metabolism, et
cetera, organ health, obesity,
6928.91 et cetera, to me,
as a neuroscientist,
6930.74 that's not surprising.
6932.15 All of it just screams
hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
6935.075 hypothalamus because
here, you're telling me,
6936.95 it's regulating these basal
functions like metabolism.
6940.4 It's regulating how
much we crave things.
6942.92 And of course,
hypothalamus is involved
6944.84 in motivation and craving.
6946.04 There are other areas, too--
6947.542 other areas of the
brain, too, of course.
6949.25 But I would imagine
that someone ought to
6953.03 or has mapped out where the
receptors for all this business
6959.55 are in the brain.
6962.13 And I guess that raises
the question of, when
6964.38 one goes on a ketogenic or low
blood glucose diet or fast,
6970.32 has anyone observed
changes in the brain?
6972.39 Has anyone had neuroimaging
of humans and their brains
6976.59 under conditions of ingesting
one diet or another,
6979.38 whether or not
they're psychiatric--
6980.97 suffering from a
psychiatric disorder or not?
6984.12 I would think that's
where the gold is.
6986.49 CHRIS PALMER: We do have
some of those studies.
6991.845 When you do a
neuroimaging study,
6993.51 you can measure a lot
of different things.
6995.26 So one thing with
a PET scan, you
6997.32 can measure glucose metabolism.
6999.49 So a researcher,
Stephen Cunnane is
7002.39 doing that research in
particular in Alzheimer's
7005.42 disease patients and Alzheimer's
disease models but in humans.
7011.12 And that's because
we know that--
7015.47 again, a common
finding in patients
7018.41 with Alzheimer's disease is
this glucose hypometabolism,
7022.83 some people are
attributing it to insulin
7025.82 signaling impairment.
7027.26 And so some people are
calling it type III diabetes.
7030.26 At the end of the day,
I think the clearest
7033.68 signal that we
have is that cells
7036.14 aren't getting enough energy
from glucose as a fuel source.
7039.95 That is something that I
think I can confidently
7042.98 say that's backed by
numerous research studies.
7046.67 There's debate in
the research field
7048.26 about whether that's a
primary driver of the illness.
7051.68 I happen to believe it is.
7053.48 And if you ask the
question, well,
7055.56 why would cells not be getting
enough fuel from glucose?
7059.03 You have to focus
on mitochondria
7060.71 because they're
the ones producing
7062.18 the fuel from that glucose.
7064.08 So you somehow you have
to implicate mitochondria
7066.44 in that process
one way or another.
7069.83 Others will say, no, that's
just a side effect of whatever's
7073.31 causing Alzheimer's disease.
7075.44 So Stephen Cunnane has
done studies where he even
7077.72 gives ketone supplements.
7079.82 ANDREW HUBERMAN: These
are liquid ketone esters?
7081.89 CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone
esters or ketone salts.
7084.74 And it has actually found that
these brain metabolism deficits
7090.05 can be corrected,
at least short-term,
7093.41 by giving a ketone supplement.
7096.138 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is this
in the context of people
7098.18 also ingesting
some carbohydrate?
7099.95 Because I confess, I've
tried the ketogenic diet.
7103.64 I probably did it wrong.
7104.768 This was years ago.
7105.56 And then the cyclic
ketogenic diet.
7107.09 But in the last year
or so, I've started
7110.87 using liquid ketone esters.
7113.36 And I do eat some
carbohydrates each day,
7116.33 usually in proportion to how
much high intensity exercise
7119.6 I'm doing.
7122.05 Those liquid ketone
esters, for me--
7125.14 at least subjectively--
I feel greatly
7127.45 increase my energy levels and
my ability to focus mentally.
7131.53 And they improve my sleep.
7133.06 This is my observation
tracking some data
7135.61 but just, again, subjectively.
7137.32 So in this example,
are you talking
7139.39 about people taking
ketone esters or ketone
7141.58 salts on a backdrop
of a ketogenic diet
7144.82 or on the backdrop of
a more typical diet?
7147.88 CHRIS PALMER: So he's done both.
7149.98 So he's done studies where
patients aren't doing
7154.66 anything special with the diet.
7156.08 So they're eating
whatever they normally
7157.747 eat, absolutely
nonketogenic, giving them
7160.9 a ketone salt or ester,
and then noticing
7164.62 immediate and direct
changes in the metabolism
7168.16 of these metabolically
compromised brain cells
7173.41 as measured by PET imaging.
7176.063 ANDREW HUBERMAN: These are not
household pets, by the way.
7178.48 Sorry, I have--
we have to just--
7180.01 P-E-T, positron emission
tomography, not pets.
7182.277 Although, I'm sure that
there are people out there
7184.36 who have their dogs,
or cats, or whatever,
7186.49 or their pet kangaroos,
whatever you might own,
7189.25 on ketogenic diet.
7190.29 OK.
7190.878 CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
7191.92 So he's actually moved further.
7193.93 He's done a pilot
trial in a nursing home
7196.12 actually, where he did
not put the patients
7198.76 on a ketogenic diet.
7200.32 He simply reduced
carbohydrate consumption
7204.43 at breakfast and lunch.
7206.89 They still got the same
dinner as everyone else.
7209.8 And simply reducing
carbohydrate consumption
7212.68 at breakfast and lunch resulted
in cognitive improvement
7216.79 in a statistically significant
way in some of those subjects.
7220.755 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, I love
that result. I'm sorry,
7222.88 I just have to highlight this.
7224.13 I'm a huge believer in
directing carbohydrates
7227.53 to specific portions
of the day when
7229.18 one needs to be less
focused and alert
7231.97 and yet can replenish glycogen.
7235.33 Limiting carbohydrates most
of the time during the day,
7238.75 for me, has been a game
changer in terms of maintaining
7241.96 alertness, et cetera.
7242.92 I'm not aware that I have
age-related cognitive decline.
7245.89 But then again, I would-- people
around me may argue otherwise.
7248.875 CHRIS PALMER: Let me say,
you are Andrew Huberman.
7250.96 There is no way you have
[LAUGHS] cognitive impairment.
7253.96 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although
you didn't know me
7254.62 as a six-year-old--
7254.83 CHRIS PALMER: If you have
cognitive impairment,
7256.36 we're all screwed.
7257.5 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, I have plenty
7259.0 of flaws and impairments--
well over 3,000
7261.07 documented by people
very close to me.
7265.37 But this is very
interesting, I think,
7267.272 in the context of everything
we've been talking about
7269.48 because could it be
that supplementing
7272.81 with liquid ketones
or prescribing
7276.53 liquid ketones to people
who are challenged with mood
7281.42 disorders-- or things of that
sort-- could be beneficial,
7284.24 even if they are not
willing or able to adhere
7287.63 to a ketogenic diet?
7288.738 CHRIS PALMER: That is the
million dollar question
7290.78 right now.
7291.35 And we don't have good
trial data to say yes or no.
7299.06 My speculation, my hunch,
having tried that clinically
7303.86 with patients, is it
doesn't seem to work.
7308.4 It's not the same thing.
7312.01 The bigger reason for my
feeling confident in saying that
7316.87 is that we've had
ketone salts and esters
7320.68 available for over a decade now.
7324.64 We have tens of thousands of
children and adolescents who
7328.33 are following a strict,
ridiculously strict, ketogenic
7332.53 diet to control their epilepsy.
7336.03 Those kids would love to
be off the ketogenic diet.
7339.84 Their parents would love to have
them off the ketogenic diet.
7343.255 ANDREW HUBERMAN: They had no
birthday cake, no ice cream.
7345.63 CHRIS PALMER: There
is not one case report
7349.26 of any child controlling
his or her seizures using
7353.79 exogenous ketones without
also doing the ketogenic diet.
7359.53 I just find it hard to
believe that at least some
7363.1 of those people haven't
tried it out to see.
7366.58 I do know some patients
with bipolar disorder
7370.27 and even schizophrenia who
are doing extraordinarily well
7375.49 on a ketogenic diet.
7377.35 They have tried to switch
off the ketogenic diet using
7381.07 exogenous ketones.
7382.72 Their symptoms came back.
7384.89 And so they found that
it just wasn't effective.
7388.49 Now, again, those are anecdotes.
7391.61 My scientific
speculation about why
7395.24 is because the ketogenic diet is
actually not necessarily about
7401.4 ketones themselves.
7403.86 Ketones are one of a
multifaceted story there.
7408.16 And so when people
do a ketogenic diet,
7411.96 they're also improving--
they're lowering glucose levels.
7415.35 They're improving
insulin signaling.
7418.65 They're ramping up mitochondrial
biogenesis, in particular,
7423.81 in the liver because
mitochondria actually
7427.65 make ketones.
7429.24 That's where they're made.
7430.35 And they're primarily made
in the liver mitochondria.
7433.72 So when somebody is
on in a fasting state
7436.68 or on a ketogenic diet,
their liver mitochondria
7440.79 go through the roof because
they're being called to action.
7444.42 It's like, hey, body's
in starvation mode.
7447.03 Get to work.
7448.09 And so the mitochondria--
7450.18 the cell senses we need
more mitochondria to process
7454.02 fat to turn it into ketones so
that those ketones can get up
7457.53 to the brain and keep
the brain fueled,
7459.9 because fatty acids
can't fuel the brain.
7463.5 Only ketones can.
7465.78 Now, so my sense is that--
and the gut microbiome changes
7470.94 and everything, the
changes in hormones--
7472.93 so if you're eating
a lot of donuts
7476.94 and drinking a
bottle of ketones,
7479.49 the donuts are going
to prevent your body
7482.79 from lowering glucose levels.
7484.598 You're still going to
have the high glucose
7486.39 levels from the donuts.
7487.512 You're still going
to probably have
7488.97 the impaired insulin signaling.
7490.89 You're probably still
going to possibly
7493.59 have some inflammation from
the inflammatory effects
7497.19 of that food.
7499.62 And so just drinking ketones
alone won't be enough.
7505.41 I think for people who are
metabolically healthy, I'll
7509.37 include you in that, I think
ketones can play a really
7512.67 beneficial role, no doubt.
7515.01 I think exogenous
ketones may, in fact,
7519.75 proven valuable in
clinical use for patients
7524.13 who maybe can't follow a
super strict ketogenic diet
7526.77 but maybe could do
a low carb diet.
7529.403 And then given the
research that's
7530.82 happening with
alcohol use disorder,
7534.17 I could imagine a
situation-- here's
7536.36 the million dollar
tip to whoever
7539.84 wants to go out and get this,
if it actually turns out
7542.09 to be true.
7543.6 I could imagine a scenario
where we use exogenous ketones
7547.25 with alcoholics.
7548.78 And that every time they have
a severe craving for alcohol,
7552.08 they drink ketones instead.
7554.34 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which sort
of tastes like alcohol.
7556.54 The ketone esters, when I take
them, I drink them straight.
7560.162 Sometimes I'll put
them in seltzer.
7561.62 And I'm not a big
drinker, as I mentioned.
7563.37 I might have an alcoholic
drink every once in a while.
7565.7 I just don't ever crave it.
7567.11 I just do it every maybe--
7570.47 I think 2020 was the last
time I had a drink of alcohol.
7574.31 So obviously, I'm not a
good representative example.
7577.55 But the ketones
taste good to me.
7579.83 And they obviously
don't get you drunk.
7582.56 They do seem to flick on my
alertness pretty quickly.
7588.11 My understanding is that they
are the brain's preferred fuel
7592.52 source.
7593.49 Meaning, they are going
to be the first fuels used
7596.9 by the brain when there's a
buffet of fuels available.
7603.818 If there's glucose
in my bloodstream,
7605.36 there's circulating
liquid ketones,
7607.49 the ketones would be used
first or preferentially.
7610.4 Is that true?
7612.12 CHRIS PALMER: I think
it's a complex question.
7617.015 Some research that we have
suggest that there are brain
7620.93 areas or brain cells that
require glucose and cannot use
7626.27 ketones.
7627.51 So 100% of the brain cannot
be fueled with ketones as far
7631.58 as we can tell.
7632.81 So there are some areas
that require glucose.
7636.71 And that's probably the
reason we have gluconeogenesis
7639.56 to keep the body going and keep
the brain going no matter what.
7645.57 But when ketones are available,
especially if ketones are high,
7652.66 the way I think about
it is not that ketones
7655.9 are the preferred fuel
source and glucose
7658.45 goes to the wayside.
7660.7 But the way I think
about it is that you
7662.8 have a range of
cells with varying
7666.16 degrees of metabolic health.
7668.86 And some of those
cells are going
7670.24 to be extraordinarily healthy
with appropriate healthy
7674.83 abundant mitochondria.
7677.21 And those cells
are probably going
7678.82 to continue to use
glucose as a fuel source.
7682.22 But if ketones
happen to be there,
7683.89 sure, they'll use that, too.
7685.3 Why not?
7686.89 But the real money
is metabolically
7689.14 compromised tissues,
whether it's
7692.23 brain cells or
other tissues that--
7695.13 we're talking about the brain.
7696.38 So if you've got metabolically
compromised brain cells--
7699.76 because it's not
across the board.
7701.44 Like with Alzheimer's
brain scans,
7703.93 there are specific regions
that are more metabolically
7706.9 compromised than others.
7708.35 And that's why we see patterns
of atrophy in specific brain
7712.81 regions.
7713.68 It's because those regions are
dysfunctional metabolically
7718.63 for whatever reason.
7720.1 And we can get into
why that might be.
7723.97 But my sense is that if you've
got a metabolically compromised
7727.21 cell, that cell is sending
out a distress signal.
7730.96 That cell is calling resources
from the body, like feed me.
7737.35 Give me something.
7739.03 And if it can't use
glucose effectively,
7741.58 it is going to suck
up those ketones
7744.1 and then start running on all
cylinders or closer to it.
7749.38 And that process is so
critical because what it means
7755.17 is that if that cell
was barely getting
7759.58 by on 60% of its
real ATP requirement,
7765.19 it means that it doesn't have
enough energy for maintenance
7768.34 and repair functions.
7770.74 As soon as you give that
cell a hundred percent energy
7774.19 or close to it, even
if you get it up
7776.77 to 90% of its preferred
energy amount,
7782.74 it can start to repair itself.
7786.01 That's the beauty
of the human body
7787.84 in living organisms,
is that they
7789.94 have a priority list of
what they're going to do.
7795.325 If that cell senses that
there are defective molecules,
7800.2 defective proteins
in this cell that
7803.17 need to be replaced,
once it gets enough fuel,
7807.61 it will start repairing
itself and doing that work.
7811.963 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That makes sense.
7813.38 Thank you for that
clarification.
7817.463 I'd like to talk
about Alzheimer's
7818.88 and age-related cognitive
decline generally.
7822.36 I know many people
out there are just
7825.3 terrified of losing their
memory for the obvious reasons.
7829.32 Memory sets context, et cetera.
7831.48 And many people
have relatives that
7834.51 suffer from Alzheimer's or
other forms of dementia.
7837.75 I've heard that the
ketogenic diet and diets like
7841.86 it can be very
effective for helping
7846.12 to offset some of the
symptoms of Alzheimer's
7848.88 and age-related
cognitive decline.
7850.51 In fact, I even have a friend
I won't out by institution,
7854.22 who's the chair of
Cardiology, who contacted me,
7857.88 of all people, asking whether or
not I was aware of any studies
7863.28 or whether or not I knew of
anybody who had benefited from
7867.42 ketogenic diet for Alzheimer's.
7868.868 And I thought, well, why don't
you ask one of your colleagues
7871.41 in neurology?
7872.22 But his response was
really interesting.
7874.57 He said there are many books out
there for the general public.
7878.46 There are a lot of online
discussions about this.
7880.832 There are a lot of
assertions about this,
7882.54 and some animal studies.
7885.26 Again, these are his words.
7887.92 There are very few, if any,
controlled clinical trials
7892.47 exploring the role
of the ketogenic diet
7895.17 for the treatment or
reversal of Alzheimer's
7898.17 and age-related
cognitive decline.
7899.76 I'm hoping that statement
was incorrect or soon will be
7902.7 incorrect-- because those
trials are ongoing--
7904.92 but he said, yeah, the people
are most popular for telling us
7910.59 about the important role
and positive role of being
7914.67 in ketosis for Alzheimer's,
for some reason,
7917.22 they just won't do
a clinical trial.
7919.51 And that's been frustrating
to the community.
7922.36 So this is a very educated,
very accomplished person
7925.11 who's a physician of
heart medicine as opposed
7928.44 to something else
related to the brain.
7932.26 But what is the story there.
7935.28 And for goodness' sake, why
aren't there clinical trials
7938.31 on ketogenic diet
and Alzheimer's?
7940.26 I don't expect you to be
responsible for that fact.
7945.42 But goodness, I would
think this would
7947.67 be the obvious thing for NIH.
7951.12 I'm on study section but not
for these sorts of experiments.
7954.93 Why isn't money just avalanching
into this area based on all
7959.04 the anecdotal evidence that
people are talking about?
7962.082 CHRIS PALMER: So
we've got a couple
7963.54 of small pilot clinical trials.
7967.08 The best one was a
randomized controlled trial.
7970.62 I think it only included 26
subjects, something like that,
7974.52 randomized to 12 weeks of a
low fat diet, 10-week washout,
7981.54 12 weeks of ketogenic diet.
7984.45 Some of the participants got
keto first and then low fat.
7987.9 Other participants
got low fat then keto.
7991.02 And that trial actually
found that when patients
7996.18 were in ketosis, they had
statistically significant
8002.87 improvement in activities
of daily living and quality
8007.49 of life.
8008.99 And they did have improvement
in cognitive function.
8012.47 But it didn't reach
statistical significance,
8015.05 that improvement did not.
8018.65 We've got other trials.
8020.84 We've got several animal models
showing that the ketogenic diet
8025.49 can improve biomarkers
of Alzheimer's disease
8029.12 in Alzheimer's models.
8031.28 So it can reduce
plaques and tangles,
8033.68 can even improve cognitive
impairment in animal models.
8040.25 And we've got a couple
of other small pilot
8042.62 trials of ketogenic
diet in humans,
8045.95 showing that it improves
biomarkers compared
8048.98 to, say, the low fat diet or
the American Heart Association
8051.8 diet.
8052.58 So we've got those.
8055.23 I think one of the
biggest challenges
8056.87 that I'll just share openly--
8059.535 and this is-- I'm
somebody who's pretty
8061.16 passionate about this research.
8062.48 And I believe it has
a lot of potential.
8066.32 But Johns Hopkins'
researchers attempted
8070.58 to do exactly this kind of a
study, Alzheimer's patients'
8076.88 ketogenic diet
versus the, I think,
8080.15 American Academy of Aging--
8081.56 or something like that--
diet, is the controlled diet.
8083.965 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which presumably
8085.34 has starches in there.
8086.48 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
8086.54 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think
that's the key variable.
8087.56 CHRIS PALMER: Probably
lots of-- yeah, lots of--
8089.33 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And some potatoes--
8089.93 CHRIS PALMER: Whole grains,
lots of whole grains.
8091.08 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, some potatoes.
8093.11 CHRIS PALMER: And they spent,
I believe, over three years.
8098.26 They screened over 1,300
people who expressed interest.
8107.583 At the end of the
day, I think they only
8109.25 got 27 people to enroll.
8112.49 And only 14 of those
people completed the study.
8116.18 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
8117.53 CHRIS PALMER: Despite
that, what they
8119.69 found was that the subjects
who achieved ketosis
8123.41 had cognitive improvement.
8126.98 But people on study
section are going
8129.56 to look at a study like that
and say, even if the science is
8135.11 there, if you can't get
people to do this diet,
8139.86 why would we spend money
on researchers trying
8143.7 to get people to do this diet?
8145.35 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I should mention,
8146.767 study section is this closed
door panels of 40 or so people.
8151.303 There are many of these panels.
8155.34 Different divisions in the
National Institutes of Health
8158.005 use different panels.
8158.88 And then grants are
evaluated in a very small,
8163.128 because of the size of the
federal budget for research,
8165.42 a very small percentage.
8168.54 Usually, about 10% of
these studies are funded.
8171.78 The rest generally
don't end up happening.
8176.7 That is very informative.
8179.94 What you just described
is very informative
8181.8 because now it
makes sense to me.
8184.83 There's no conspiracy.
8186.69 It's not big pharma,
I don't think,
8188.97 is trying to suppress
trials of ketogenic diets
8193.027 on Alzheimer's because
I would imagine
8194.61 the first thing that
pharma would want to do
8196.68 is to see that study done.
8197.921 So they didn't have to.
8198.879 And then the moment it was done,
if it showed a positive effect,
8201.45 they'd probably want
to isolate the molecule
8203.283 and wrap it up in something
that people would take, right?
8205.74 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
8206.01 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So I don't think
8206.67 there's any active
suppression by pharma.
8208.378 I think pharma would probably
be cheering from the sidelines
8210.93 because they could capitalize
on it, because ultimately,
8213.472 the studies are
done by scientists.
8214.93 But the treatments are
generally doled out
8216.9 by pharmaceutical companies
and/or physicians.
8219.67 So I don't believe there's
a conspiracy there.
8221.79 That is very interesting.
8223.2 And it's kind of amazing,
given our discussion
8227.17 of earlier, which is that
you had a patient that
8229.93 was having schizophrenic
symptoms who
8232.54 managed to stay on this diet.
8234.1 So is there something special
about Alzheimer's patients
8238.15 and people with age-related
cognitive decline?
8240.309 Presumably, they're
very dependent on others
8242.86 to cook for them
and shop for them.
8246.58 I think that this is almost
perfect controlled environment
8249.43 for getting this study done.
8250.91 CHRIS PALMER: I think
that is the key issue.
8253.82 So again, I got patients--
8256.48 I get patients with bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia,
8261.16 extraordinarily impaired
people to do this diet
8265.6 and stay with it.
8266.59 But it's because I'm providing
a weekly session for them.
8272.32 And I imagine this
study did not provide
8276.04 that kind of intensive support.
8279.52 In the pilot trial that
I described to you,
8281.83 they actually got, I
think, over 90% compliance
8284.709 with the different
dietary interventions.
8287.57 So some of it is going to
be dependent on the research
8291.58 group.
8292.18 And does the research group
understand that this is not--
8295.87 it's not like
prescribing a pill.
8298.18 Here, take this pill.
8300.1 And take it every day and
come back in three weeks.
8303.79 And even then, we
don't know for sure
8305.44 that the patient took
the pill every day.
8307.27 We just assume they
took the pill every day.
8309.52 And studies say they
probably didn't.
8312.79 So I think when we think
about a dietary intervention,
8315.7 we need to think about
more intensive support
8319.6 and education.
8321.129 And that support could be a
health and wellness coach.
8324.44 It could be a dietician.
8326.02 It could be education
of the family.
8328.54 It might even be providing
them with dietary meals.
8335.02 That maybe for six months,
we actually provide them
8339.67 with ketogenic meals--
8342.879 once a week, put
them in your freezer.
8345.91 Microwave them when needed--
8347.77 to make this diet as easy
and doable as possible.
8354.2 Because if we can get
people to do the diet,
8356.99 if we can get them through
the first couple of months,
8359.879 most people can learn
how to do this diet.
8363.26 More importantly-- I
didn't mention this before.
8367.23 But the number one reason I
am so successful at getting
8370.85 patients to stay on
this diet for years,
8374.98 is because of the consequences
to them when they go off of it.
8379.95 That is the reason I can
get schizophrenic patients
8383.37 and bipolar patients
to do this diet,
8385.629 whereas other people can't
get an everyday human
8388.8 being to do it for weight
loss because the weight loss
8391.98 patient doesn't experience
devastating tormenting symptoms
8398.34 when they break the diet.
8400.83 Oftentimes, they are rewarded.
8402.45 They eat something
they really enjoy.
8405.24 And they get a little bit
of a dopamine rush from it.
8407.76 And they're off to the races.
8409.02 They're like, I'm going to--
oh, I've already cheated.
8411.27 I'll cheat again.
8412.21 I'll get back on it someday.
8413.52 And they never get around to it.
8415.85 My patients, when
they go off the diet,
8419.3 they start hallucinating
within 48--
8421.4 or 24, 48 hours.
8424.01 And they quickly realize that
was a really stupid thing
8427.4 to do.
8428.21 That piece of cake
was not at all worth
8431.39 the torment that I'm
experiencing now.
8434.3 So they get back on the diet.
8436.25 I suspect with
Alzheimer's disease,
8438.48 we might notice
something similar.
8442.28 Some of these people
have very mild symptoms.
8444.99 So maybe they won't
have that kind
8447.65 of a reinforcement, negative
reinforcing kind of experience.
8452.51 But I think some of them will.
8454.34 Some of them recognize that
they are impaired cognitively.
8460.7 And if this diet could
help them remember better,
8464.33 if this diet could help
them function better--
8466.883 and again, that's what
the pilot trial showed,
8468.8 is activities of daily living.
8470.367 That means these
people are able to go
8471.95 to the bathroom on their own.
8473.39 They're able to get
themselves dressed.
8475.4 Whereas, they needed help
with those things before.
8479.81 Those are actually
really important things
8482.72 to both the patient
and the caregiver.
8487.37 And if they go off
the diet and then
8489.26 quickly revert into a
more symptomatic state,
8493.58 that might be reinforcing
enough for them
8497.57 to figure out a way to
do the diet on their own.
8501.38 And if we think
about, if this really
8503.33 is an effective
intervention-- and yes,
8505.13 we need longer trials,
larger trials, all of that,
8508.04 because there are
plenty of stories
8510.32 in the medical field where
pilot trials looked really
8514.4 spectacular and promising.
8516.59 And then larger trials just
failed to show the benefits.
8521.55 I believe, based on all
the science of metabolism,
8525.3 mitochondria, glucose
hypometabolism, all of that,
8528.3 I believe the science makes
this an obvious treatment that
8534.42 has real potential.
8536.19 So people will call me biased.
8539.19 That's fine.
8539.727 I've got my bias.
8540.435 ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based
on clinical observation
8542.76 and extensive clinical
observation at that--
8545.61 I think biases that
are simply because we
8548.22 want to feel a certain
way or believe something
8551.34 are worth critiquing.
8553.53 But bias based on
observation-- here,
8557.01 I should mention that most of
what we know about human memory
8562.17 was sparked by one patient,
a famous HM, who I think
8565.62 was living in Harvard Medical,
in one of the hospitals around.
8569.697 There are many hospitals
on Longwood Campus.
8571.53 But one patient, the
reason we associate
8576.21 the hippocampus with memory
is because we knew that HM's
8579.69 the hippocampus
was intentionally
8581.73 damaged for epilepsy treatment.
8584.28 So this idea that
everything has to be
8586.89 a randomized clinical
trial, to me, is crazy.
8589.89 Of course, that's
a gold standard.
8592.35 And it's essential.
8594.0 But there's so much information
in textbooks, medical textbooks
8598.38 in particular, that are gleaned
from single-patient case
8601.38 studies or from three-patient
neurostimulation in the brain
8605.34 or something of that sort.
8606.46 So to me, I'm still
perplexed as to why
8612.78 there's this insistence on
only one form of evidence.
8617.46 Clearly, what you're
doing, the important work
8620.328 that you're doing clinically,
and in the research side,
8622.62 and in public communication,
is assisting this.
8626.05 I have a question about--
8627.79 or more of a statement/question
about the ketogenic diet.
8631.54 Based on everything
that we've talked about,
8633.73 seems to me that the
ketogenic diet for weight loss
8637.6 is a very interesting
aspect of the diet
8640.15 as is intermittent
fasting for weight loss
8643.09 even though it might just be
by way of caloric restriction
8646.06 that occurs with fasting.
8647.97 But then in some
ways, the effects
8650.88 of the ketogenic
diet on weight loss
8653.19 are a bit of a decoy
for most people.
8655.402 That's where their mind goes.
8656.61 This person lost X
amount of weight.
8658.26 Maybe that made
them feel better.
8659.47 Maybe that actually
made them underweight.
8660.72 I think you've talked about it.
8661.59 For some people, it can actually
bring them under weight.
8666.68 I'm glad that we got
the chance to dive
8668.33 into the description of
ketogenic diet for epilepsy
8670.73 because it really is a
medical intervention that
8673.88 has a side effect of
weight loss or could
8676.73 be used to treat obesity
and induce weight loss.
8680.12 But it's really about
far more than that.
8684.12 And that raises a question
for me, which is--
8687.431 we've been talking about the
ketogenic diet as one thing.
8691.07 But I've heard you
discuss this before,
8693.65 where just as a physician will
prescribe different dosage
8698.45 ranges of a given drug, you
can prescribe different dosage
8702.8 ranges of a nutritional
plan, a diet.
8705.63 It's not one thing.
8706.73 It's not necessarily
zero carbohydrates
8709.22 or 100 grams or 50 grams.
8710.69 It depends on the patient
and a lot of other factors.
8714.14 I've heard you list off
various things classic keto.
8716.667 Maybe you could just briefly
tell us what that typically
8719.0 is, because I think
most people think
8721.4 it means eating a lot of
meat and not carbohydrates.
8724.82 But it might not be that.
8727.01 Fasting and then some
of the other-- you
8729.2 mentioned Atkins earlier.
8730.488 We don't have to go into
each of these in detail.
8732.53 And I know in your
book, you talk about
8734.155 not just the science and
clinical background but also
8736.43 some actionable steps that
people could consider.
8739.26 So they can refer
there for more detail.
8741.66 But for somebody
who, let's say, is
8744.17 depressed-- they've had
some rounds of depression.
8746.78 Maybe they're on
antidepressants, maybe not--
8748.85 and they want to try
something like this.
8751.56 Obviously, this has to be done
in concert with a physician
8754.91 observing all this.
8756.14 But what is the typical thing
that you probe with first?
8760.167 Just like with a
drug, you might probe
8761.75 with 20 milligrams of a drug.
8763.22 What's your typical initial
dietary intervention probe?
8768.26 Terrible languaging, I realize.
8769.67 And I'm criticizing
myself for that.
8771.95 But I think people get the idea.
8774.08 CHRIS PALMER: The real
answer is that I don't have
8776.24 a one-size-fits-all
recommendation for any person.
8779.365 So the first thing
that I'm going
8780.74 to assess with the patient is,
what symptoms are they having?
8784.55 What is their current diet like?
8786.56 And what are they willing to do?
8788.6 I try to meet them
where they're at.
8790.68 So if somebody-- and
I want to point out.
8794.72 You mentioned the
all-meat version
8797.39 of this diet, which
is often referred
8799.82 to as the carnivore diet.
8800.972 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Very
controversial diet.
8802.68 CHRIS PALMER: There is
no doubt that exists.
8804.94 Some people swear by it.
8805.94 They swear they've tried other
versions of ketogenic diets
8808.618 and only when they went
to a carnivore diet
8810.41 did they get benefits.
8812.09 But there are vegetarian
and vegan versions
8814.55 of the ketogenic diet.
8816.18 So in my mind,
this is not at all
8818.9 about the diet wars
of animal-sourced
8821.54 versus plant-sourced foods.
8823.28 It's about inducing a
state of ketosis, which
8827.06 is mimicking the fasting state.
8829.07 That is what it's about.
8830.42 And you can do that by
not eating anything,
8832.94 by fasting and/or
intermittent fasting.
8835.88 And you get your results.
8837.36 So no diet is a ketogenic diet.
8841.62 So it's not about the
foods or the types of foods
8844.67 that you're eating.
8845.55 It's about inducing
a state of ketosis.
8848.27 The first variable I'm going to
look at when I recommend this
8851.09 or prescribe this is the
person's current weight.
8854.39 If somebody is obese
versus somebody who's thin,
8859.58 I'm going to use different
dietary strategies
8861.71 for those two situations.
8863.18 In the obese patient, they
have tons of fat stores
8866.45 on their body already.
8868.22 Usually, it is a goal of theirs
to tap into some of those.
8871.82 And they'd like to
lose some weight
8873.83 if they're going to try a
ketogenic diet for brain health
8876.53 anyway.
8877.76 And so I'm going to use that.
8879.9 So that person, really, the diet
is carbohydrate restriction.
8884.42 And that usually is a
sufficient intervention.
8887.158 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Both
simple carbohydrates,
8888.95 meaning sugars
and fructose also?
8891.89 CHRIS PALMER:
Fructose, definitely.
8893.39 So no added sugars, essentially.
8896.69 You can have added natural
sweeteners like stevia or monk
8900.68 fruit.
8902.09 You might use
artificial sweeteners.
8906.26 Years of doing
this, I'd probably
8908.858 recommend steer away
from them if you
8910.4 can because I think
they tend to stimulate
8912.2 cravings for high carb foods.
8915.02 So if you can kind of get
through a couple of weeks
8917.84 without sweet things,
your cravings for those
8923.09 will go down.
8923.87 And it'll make the diet easier
and a little more sustainable.
8926.42 But let's say you can have
your artificial sweeteners,
8929.72 if that's what you really want.
8932.93 So I'm going to say less
than 20 grams of carbs a day
8935.17 for those people.
8936.93 They can have all the
protein they want.
8939.06 They can have vegetables.
8940.643 And they can have all
the fat they want.
8942.31 But I'm not going to
push fat on those people.
8945.06 I'm not going to tell them, eat
a lot of fat, at the same time
8947.82 because I want to use the fat
on their body as the fat source,
8952.44 at least early on.
8953.64 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Are you encouraging
8955.14 healthy fats like
monounsaturated fats,
8956.91 like olive oil?
8957.66 Are you encouraging people
to eat a little less
8961.83 butter, et cetera?
8967.26 CHRIS PALMER: I tend
to encourage, again,
8970.85 a wide range of fats.
8971.825 And it's going to
depend on the person.
8973.45 A lot of times, people come to
me with very specific ideas.
8977.17 But I'm going to tend to
encourage olive oil, avocados,
8981.53 nuts, which are
usually considered,
8984.07 even by the American
Heart Association,
8985.75 healthy sources of fat.
8988.21 The more controversial
thing are things
8989.98 like coconut oil or coconut
cream, which the American Heart
8993.46 Association might say
is not a healthy fat,
8996.1 I kind of disagree with
that and don't think
8998.68 it's unhealthy at all actually.
9001.17 And when you look at the
epidemiological studies
9004.14 of saturated fat
causing heart disease
9007.47 or causing adverse outcomes, at
best, maybe increases your risk
9012.6 10% to 15%-- at best.
9013.908 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
How much coconut oil
9015.45 can people ingest, anyway,
before they either develop
9019.29 diarrhea-- no joke--
or just sort of get
9021.99 tired of coconut oil?
9023.61 Anyway, your point is taken.
9027.06 But they can eat meat
if they like meat?
9029.46 CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
9029.64 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or
they can eat eggs.
9030.81 Or if they don't
like meat and eggs,
9032.4 they could eat sardines
or things of that sort.
9034.5 I personally can't--
9035.407 I can't even stomach the--
9036.49 I don't even like
the word "sardine."
9038.365 I have nothing against
the actual fish.
9039.99 But that's just me.
9041.73 But obviously, people have--
9042.99 I say this because people have
different preferences, right?
9045.6 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
9046.14 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I'll eat a steak.
9046.77 But I'm not going
to eat a sardine.
9047.91 CHRIS PALMER: And I'm
going to go with that.
9049.743 And again, there are vegan
sources of protein that--
9052.38 people can eat tempeh
and other things.
9055.51 So that's the obese person.
9060.12 It's carb restriction as
the primary initial phase.
9064.72 The thin person is going
to need to eat a lot of fat
9067.38 because they don't have a lot
of fat stores on their body.
9070.66 And if I want them in
ketosis, clinical ketosis,
9073.98 I'm going to have
to feed them fat.
9075.612 So that's the person
that I'm going
9077.07 to say, make sure
you get in avocados,
9080.79 olive oil, butter,
maybe heavy cream.
9085.72 So heavy cream is delicious.
9087.09 It's a delicious way
to get your fats in.
9090.105 I have one patient who
just drinks it straight,
9092.25 to just try to get it in.
9093.597 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I get it.
9094.68 I've never had an
appetite for sweets.
9098.49 I absolutely love
savory fatty food.
9102.0 When I was in high
school, I was thin.
9104.52 So I was able to do this.
9106.27 But I used to drink
half-and-half.
9107.687 Sometimes I wake up in
the middle of the night
9109.603 and drink it just because
it tastes so, so good.
9111.78 CHRIS PALMER: It
does taste good.
9113.57 So if they're on
a ketogenic diet,
9115.08 I'm going to push them
away from half-and-half
9117.93 and toward heavy whipping cream.
9121.62 So you can whip that up.
9123.15 You can freeze it.
9124.11 It turns into ice cream.
9125.53 You can add vanilla.
9126.42 You can add cocoa powder.
9127.667 You can add all sorts of things.
9129.0 And you're off to the races
with shakes, and ice cream,
9132.21 and mousse, and all sorts
of things that you can have.
9137.82 With any of these patients,
the beauty of this diet
9141.45 is I have objective biomarkers.
9144.06 I'm going to have them
measuring ketones.
9146.13 And I'm going to adjust the diet
based on their state of ketosis
9150.09 and/or the clinical benefits
that I'm looking for.
9154.02 If it's an average person,
who is not currently
9157.08 under psychiatric care, not
taking prescription medicines
9161.64 but is saying, I'm burned out.
9164.43 I'm exhausted.
9165.93 I want some of that brain
energy that Andrew Huberman
9168.63 is talking about.
9169.98 He talks about feeling good.
9171.33 I want some of that.
9173.16 I'm probably actually
going to recommend
9174.93 the protocol you
describe, which is,
9177.36 let's see if we can just
carb restrict for a while
9181.47 and see if that produces
clinical benefit.
9184.41 I have one-- he's
not even a patient,
9187.32 just somebody who read my book.
9191.61 I didn't tell him anything.
9193.65 And he came away
from it saying--
9195.57 he was ready to start an
antidepressant for his anxiety.
9200.1 He had chronic anxiety,
was trying meditation,
9202.59 was trying all sorts of things.
9204.84 Nothing-- those
things weren't enough.
9207.64 He was ready to go on
prescription medicine.
9210.3 He read an early
copy of the book.
9212.16 He took it upon himself without
consulting with me to restrict
9215.31 carbohydrates alone.
9216.66 He did not go ketogenic.
9218.4 He is a vegetarian.
9221.02 He restricted carbs.
9222.75 Within three weeks,
said, I don't
9225.84 need prescription medicine.
9227.31 I can't believe how
much better I feel.
9229.89 And all I did was cut
out some of the high carb
9233.19 foods in my diet.
9235.27 So I think for some people,
it can be that simple.
9239.44 For people with serious
mental disorders,
9242.45 if they are chronically
depressed, if they're
9244.51 on lots of prescription
meds, if they're
9246.43 disabled by their
symptoms, and certainly,
9248.83 if you're bipolar or have
schizophrenia or something,
9253.6 those are the people
I really do want
9255.16 them to work with a
medical professional
9257.87 because meds may
need to be adjusted.
9262.28 They need a real
shot at this diet.
9266.71 It's not like weight loss.
9268.16 Weight loss, everybody wings it.
9270.41 And either you're
successful or you aren't.
9272.36 You look on the internet or
you read a book or you do--
9275.51 even the colleague
that you mentioned,
9277.7 he's probably just reading--
9280.17 who knows whether it's
credible information or not--
9284.37 and just winging it, and
seeing whether it works or not.
9290.05 For people with serious
mental disorders,
9293.08 I want you to treat it like you
have epilepsy because you do
9298.75 have a serious brain disorder.
9301.39 It's impairing your ability
to function in the world.
9304.21 It's impairing your
health and happiness.
9306.55 You deserve a competent
medical treatment.
9309.76 And we have that.
9310.81 We have a hundred-year
evidence-based.
9314.24 We've got dieticians
who know this
9317.06 like the back of their hand.
9318.62 They can monitor your
level of ketosis.
9324.13 They can help look for vitamin
and nutrient deficiencies
9327.13 that can be a
consequence of the diet,
9329.53 and make sure that you're
not developing those.
9331.81 They can help tweak
the diet if needed.
9334.99 They can give you ideas if
you're getting bored with eggs
9337.45 every morning.
9338.11 They can give you ideas for
what else you might have.
9340.825 And if you're using it to
treat a serious disorder,
9345.22 I think you need serious help.
9348.24 ANDREW HUBERMAN: A
couple of questions,
9350.33 a little more detailed,
but I think a lot of people
9353.09 will have this on their mind.
9355.13 Is it ever the case
that you'll prescribe
9357.8 somebody the ketogenic
diet in conjunction
9360.59 with intermittent fasting?
9361.7 So eat keto but eat
between the hours
9364.16 of, whatever, 11:00 AM and
8:00 PM or something like that.
9368.057 That's the first question.
9369.14 CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
9370.58 And I have one patient with
type 2 diabetes and chronic
9373.85 depression.
9374.63 And he will try to follow
the ketogenic diet.
9378.05 And sometimes, his blood
sugars are still very high.
9382.74 And sometimes I
will ask him to do
9385.13 either intermittent fasting or
even a three or four day water
9389.39 fast.
9390.89 And it is shocking.
9392.93 When he does a three or four
day water fast, the first day
9397.22 or two, he feels like crap.
9398.87 I'll just say up front,
don't do it if you've got
9401.96 an important meeting or
business trip or anything.
9404.51 Don't be--
9405.11 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So this
is just consuming water.
9406.89 CHRIS PALMER: This is
just consuming water.
9408.682 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
No black coffee?
9410.6 CHRIS PALMER: I usually tell him
he can have plain black coffee
9413.9 or tea.
9415.37 But--
9416.275 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
have mercy after all.
9418.025 CHRIS PALMER: I have
a tiny ounce of mercy.
9422.43 But when he does it, his blood
sugars plummet in a good way,
9428.22 his blood sugars
are normalizing.
9430.6 But the last time he did it,
he actually got to seven days
9434.8 at one point.
9436.14 And he said, I feel great.
9437.44 I want to keep going.
9438.45 I can't believe
that I'm not hungry.
9440.92 But I am not hungry at all.
9442.59 I don't miss food at all.
9444.96 And at seven days, I
kind of cut the cord.
9447.15 I was like, no, no.
9448.02 We're done.
9448.44 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
He needs to eat.
9448.785 CHRIS PALMER:
[LAUGHS] We're done.
9449.73 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You got to eat.
9450.48 Well, I find it
really interesting
9451.71 that the intermittent
fasting, of course,
9453.418 controversial at some level,
but as to whether or not
9457.56 it's just beneficial by way
of caloric restriction--
9460.77 because it is one way to
achieve caloric restriction--
9463.345 whether or not has
additional benefits.
9464.97 But I'm very interested
in the neural side of it.
9469.14 And it does seem
that the fasted state
9471.18 can start to take on its
own rewarding properties,
9473.97 where people get
dopamine release not
9477.3 from eating, as
most everyone does,
9479.34 but from abstaining from food.
9481.45 Now, this can be pathologic
in the sort of example
9484.35 of anorexia nervosa, which
is we both know as the most
9488.4 deadly psychiatric illness.
9490.32 But for non-anoxerics,
I think it's
9493.47 interesting to note that
eventually not eating can have
9496.53 its own rewarding properties
to it that aren't just related
9499.86 to weight loss.
9500.65 But in the short-term, feeling--
9502.03 in other words, feeling
really good by way
9503.82 of abstaining from eating.
9505.08 CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
9506.13 And that's actually-- it
raises an important risk
9509.76 that I haven't mentioned yet.
9511.89 But at least in
psychiatric patients--
9513.87 but even in some
patients who just
9515.55 use the keto diet
for weight loss,
9517.35 I have seen definite hypomania.
9520.83 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So these are people
9522.33 that aren't sleeping very much.
9525.21 Are they also getting
kind of delusional,
9527.43 thinking they're going
to run for president?
9529.44 CHRIS PALMER: No.
9530.25 So the distinction between
hypomania and mania--
9533.46 so mania, you might become
psychotic and delusional.
9536.88 Mania, by definition,
is problematic.
9539.73 It's causing a problem
in some way or another.
9542.4 And if you have
psychotic symptoms,
9543.91 it's definitely called
mania, full-blown mania.
9546.57 Hypomania, for
better or worse, is
9549.84 something every human
being probably craves.
9552.66 So it is feeling
extraordinarily good.
9557.43 It's getting by on less sleep.
9559.38 But you don't need to sleep.
9560.58 Who needs sleep?
9561.42 I've got things to do.
9564.51 My brain is running
on all cylinders.
9568.89 I feel so creative.
9572.44 There have been lots
of famous people
9574.18 through the ages who have been
bipolar, probably bipolar.
9579.04 And some of their most
productive periods of time,
9582.62 whether it's art or
creating scientific models
9587.08 or what-have-you, were probably
during hypomanic episodes.
9591.23 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what
do you do in that case?
9593.29 I'm obsessed with getting
sufficient quality sleep.
9596.32 It's a kind of a repeating
theme in our podcast
9599.17 and many of my
social media posts.
9601.69 And I always recommend
behavioral tools first,
9605.41 then exercise, viewing
sunlight, et cetera,
9609.1 at appropriate times,
avoiding late night
9611.2 artificial light exposure,
et cetera, and occasionally,
9615.465 for people who
are doing all that
9616.84 and still struggle with
sleep, supplementation.
9619.36 One of the things that
I've seen some data on
9622.66 is that for people who are
following a low carbohydrate
9625.09 diet, that inositol,
in particular,
9627.55 can be helpful for
getting into sleep
9631.06 probably because it's
a bit of an-- has
9632.89 a bit of an anti-anxiety effect.
9634.63 But presumably, there are
other things out there, too.
9636.88 The magnesiums will
generally do that.
9638.47 A hot bath will do that,
too, for that matter.
9640.72 But what you're talking about
is people who are going,
9642.97 what, a day and a
half without sleep?
9644.86 Or they're just two
hours of sleep a night?
9648.525 CHRIS PALMER: So
the worst case I
9649.9 saw was actually a mental
health professional who
9652.15 didn't recognize it initially.
9653.92 He went six months with
two to four hours of sleep
9657.73 every night.
9658.42 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because they
were on a ketogenic diet?
9659.89 CHRIS PALMER: He was
on a ketogenic diet,
9661.75 was getting by on two to four
hours of sleep every night,
9664.75 did not initially recognize
that this was a problem.
9668.24 He was feeling great.
9670.76 He was feeling that keto high.
9674.29 And he was actually
waking up at 4:00 AM,
9679.09 going for 10 to 20
mile runs most days.
9683.2 He finally stopped the ketogenic
diet after about six months
9686.26 because he said, I can't
maintain my weight.
9689.14 I'm losing too much weight.
9690.7 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, I
didn't mean to interrupt.
9692.28 I was just thinking there
are some social media
9694.238 personalities associated
with nutrition
9696.13 that might be hypomanic.
9698.53 I'll let you do the
clinical evaluation.
9702.47 So what does somebody
do in that case?
9704.47 So I don't know that
I've ever been hypomanic.
9707.29 But as I mentioned
earlier, unless I've
9709.54 done a very high intensity
workout early in the day
9712.067 and I need to replenish
carbohydrates,
9713.65 I typically eat meat, fruit, and
vegetables throughout the day--
9718.33 minimum amounts
of fruit but some.
9720.76 And then at night, I switch
over to mainly carbohydrate.
9723.7 It really helps me sleep.
9724.9 It replenishes glycogen stores.
9726.7 I sleep really well, wake
up the next morning, repeat.
9730.425 And of course, this goes
against a lot of the dogma
9732.55 that, oh, you're not
supposed to eat carbohydrates
9733.99 late in the day and [MUMBLES].
9735.37 This is what works for me.
9738.31 And so I do it.
9740.08 For somebody like this mental
health professional, who
9743.26 is hypomanic, would going off
the ketogenic diet entirely
9747.31 be the best idea?
9748.63 Or could it be
that adjusting when
9751.54 they eat their carbohydrates
would be advantageous
9754.42 in order to make
sure that they felt
9756.158 alert and great during the day?
9757.45 Maybe not hypomanic
but then could
9761.68 have a four to eight-hour a
night sleep as opposed to a two
9765.04 to four hours a night, which
is really very little sleep.
9767.59 CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, it's not--
9768.31 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It
can't be healthy.
9769.33 CHRIS PALMER: It's not healthy.
9770.35 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even if you
can do it and feel great,
9771.98 I imagine that the
brain is suffering.
9773.657 CHRIS PALMER: It is.
9774.49 And the body is suffering.
9776.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
your friends and family
9777.01 are suffering.
9777.593 CHRIS PALMER: The body is
repairing itself with sleep.
9780.02 And so yeah, it's--
9784.51 if it's somebody who
is not a patient,
9787.4 they're not a mental
health patient.
9789.25 They're not using
the ketogenic diet
9791.2 as a mental health treatment.
9792.52 They're simply doing
it for whatever.
9795.55 I actually start with
everything you've just outlined.
9800.61 Let's start with
behavioral measures first.
9804.03 And the first
intervention is education.
9807.51 You need at least six
hours of sleep a night.
9811.14 Period, end of story.
9812.85 That's non-negotiable.
9814.44 If you're not getting at least
six hours of sleep a night,
9817.56 we need to consider
this a problem.
9819.82 So figure out a way to
get 6 hours of sleep.
9822.66 For some people, that's
enough, just the education.
9825.83 They don't get out
of bed at 3:00 AM.
9829.258 It might take them an hour
to fall back to sleep.
9831.3 They fall back to sleep.
9833.57 For most people, if you can get
three nights of decent sleep
9838.31 in a row, the
hypomania goes away.
9842.3 That is the way
to extinguish it.
9845.36 And then they still go on
feeling a high from it.
9848.51 They feel great.
9850.4 Their brain feels good in
terms of memory, concentration,
9855.47 motivation, all of those things.
9857.27 But they're not
hypomanic anymore.
9861.34 And then I might use
supplements, melatonin, others
9865.53 that you mentioned,
magnesium is a big one.
9867.99 And for some, I will recommend
exactly what you're doing--
9873.0 eat some carbohydrates
in the evening
9875.94 before you're going to bed.
9877.66 Either have them at dinner
and then wait a few hours
9880.235 before you're going to go
to bed or have them right
9882.36 before you're going
to go to bed, just
9884.22 to try to calm your body
down and get it going.
9890.37 When I'm using this as
a clinical intervention,
9892.9 especially with patients
with serious mental illness,
9897.05 I actually want them in a
state of ketosis long-term.
9901.11 So I'm not going to do the
carbohydrate intervention.
9903.71 I'm going to try
all the other ones.
9905.81 But if they still can't
sleep even with supplements,
9909.05 over the counter
supplements, then I'm
9910.76 probably going to go with
prescription, sleeping
9914.24 medicines, as a
temporary stopgap
9918.72 to try to get them three to
seven days of decent sleep.
9923.88 That usually breaks
the hypomanic cycle.
9927.41 And then they stay
on the ketogenic diet
9929.75 because it ends up resulting in
all of these other improvements
9932.96 that I've described.
9934.73 Their illness can sometimes
go in to full remission.
9939.95 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it low
dose trazodone as a first line
9942.5 prescription?
9943.28 CHRIS PALMER: I would
not use trazodone.
9944.99 I would actually
specifically avoid trazodone
9947.21 because it's an antidepressant.
9949.46 And they're already hypomanic.
9951.26 And I certainly don't
want to push that further.
9953.97 So as long as it's somebody
without a history of addiction,
9958.43 I'm going to use
a benzodiazepine
9961.37 or either commonly called
the Z medicines for sleep--
9966.68 zolpidem or Ambien or
something like that.
9969.17 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those tap
into the opioid pathway?
9971.48 GABA opioid?
9972.5 CHRIS PALMER: GABA.
9974.3 I usually start with something
like Ativan or Klonopin
9976.55 or something like that--
9977.75 probably Ativan because
it's shorter-acting.
9980.76 And again, I'm only looking
to use it short-term.
9983.09 I let them know that up front.
9984.95 We're looking for three to
seven days of decent sleep.
9987.62 And then we're going to try
to get them off that medicine.
9990.83 And usually, people
are off to the races
9993.59 and can sustain it well.
9997.73 ANDREW HUBERMAN: A
question about hormones.
10000.01 Many of the Huberman Lab
podcast listeners will ask--
10004.39 any time we're talking about
something like exercise
10006.85 or a drug treatment or
behavioral training,
10009.46 people will say, what
about the menstrual cycle?
10012.19 How is that impacted by this?
10015.88 How does the menstrual cycle
impact its efficacy, et cetera?
10020.84 Carbohydrates and
caloric restriction
10023.93 have been implicated in
different interactions--
10027.05 are known to interact
with the endocrine system.
10030.33 So what do you do if you have
a patient who is depressed
10036.95 or could have
psychotic symptoms--
10038.493 but let's go with depression
because that's probably a bit
10040.91 more familiar to most people--
10042.92 and then they're on
a low carbohydrate
10045.23 or full ketogenic diet, but
their menstrual cycles cease.
10050.72 How do you deal with
those adjustments?
10053.58 And I guess we could
expand this conversation
10055.7 and say, what about
male fertility also?
10057.8 Because some caloric
diets seem to--
10061.67 my understanding is that
submaintenance caloric diets,
10067.67 so weight loss
diets, will improve
10071.35 testosterone-estrogen ratios
in males that are obese.
10074.86 But for someone
that's not obese,
10077.95 to go on a sub-caloric diet,
that it can start to impair
10081.64 testosterone levels and--
10083.29 probably not render
them infertile
10085.51 but certainly adjust
that whole axis.
10088.94 So what about interactions
between ketosis, diets,
10093.37 et cetera, and the
endocrine system?
10095.895 CHRIS PALMER: The
real answer is,
10097.27 I don't think anybody knows.
10098.71 And there's not a
one-size-fits-all answer
10101.41 because I've seen examples.
10104.94 And I'm aware of science to back
up polar opposite conclusions.
10113.07 So the first general
observation that I'll make--
10115.97 I know so many couples,
husbands and wives,
10120.41 boyfriends and girlfriends,
heterosexual couples,
10124.58 who have tried the ketogenic
diet to lose weight together--
10127.893 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
end up with a baby?
10129.56 No, I'm just kidding.
10130.18 [LAUGHS]
10130.51 CHRIS PALMER: No.
10131.218 Almost universally, the men
have a much easier time with it
10134.56 than the women.
10138.005 It's not across the board.
10139.49 But I know so many examples
where the women say
10142.97 I couldn't tolerate that diet.
10145.73 It did not make me feel better.
10148.08 It actually made me feel worse.
10150.26 And I think in those
cases, it probably
10152.57 does relate to hormones.
10155.75 I'm aware of animal
models, of mice--
10159.35 in particular, ketogenic
diet in mouse models.
10163.16 One researcher shared with me,
the thing that was striking
10167.39 is that the female
mice never got pregnant
10171.53 on the ketogenic diet.
10173.79 Whereas, the mice
on the standard diet
10175.91 were just having
babies right and left.
10177.86 And it was just
shocking, the difference.
10182.16 On the surface, it makes sense.
10185.07 The ketogenic diet is
mimicking the fasting state.
10189.56 Women who are
trying to reproduce
10191.57 should not be fasting.
10194.87 If your body is in
a fasting state,
10197.84 it probably does not
want to expend resources,
10202.55 metabolic resources, calories,
nutrients, and other things,
10206.96 to creating a baby
because your very life is
10210.8 being threatened
by, quote unquote,
10213.62 "fasting" or starvation.
10216.41 That even though
the ketogenic diet
10218.75 is a sustainable,
nonstarvation diet,
10221.66 we're really using
that diet to trick
10223.79 the body into thinking that it
is in a fasting or starvation
10227.99 state.
10229.22 And so just from a kind
of evolutionary stance,
10233.51 it makes sense that
women's bodies may actually
10237.26 have significant changes
in hormonal status
10240.38 to prevent pregnancy
because a woman should not
10244.49 be having a baby when
she's starving to death.
10249.97 I know of examples of women
who are the opposite, though,
10255.83 who have benefited
dramatically and tremendously
10259.99 from the ketogenic
diet, have put
10262.51 schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder into full remission.
10265.12 And I do actually know of
one case, at least one case.
10269.12 A woman, infertile,
she and her husband
10272.08 had been trying for three
years, no pregnancy.
10275.23 She went keto.
10276.58 Within four months,
she was pregnant.
10280.85 How do I make sense of that?
10282.62 I don't know.
10283.58 And unfortunately, I
don't think we really
10286.04 have good control data on what
does the ketogenic diet do
10292.31 to male hormonal systems, what
does the ketogenic diet do
10296.27 to female hormonal systems.
10299.21 But clearly, I think
changes are happening.
10306.61 I don't have a way to
predict it, at least.
10308.44 If somebody else has great
insights, I welcome them.
10311.45 But I haven't seen
them published.
10313.27 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
a terrific answer
10314.895 because when things are all over
the place and bidirectional,
10317.71 depending on one
circumstance or the other,
10319.88 I think it screams for
controlled studies,
10323.11 and more descriptions
of case studies,
10325.93 and anecdotal data, too.
10327.53 So I think it's an
excellent answer.
10329.53 It also calls to mind the
important public service
10333.13 announcement that because of
these bidirectional effects
10336.04 that you described,
please don't use
10337.96 fasting or the ketogenic
diet as a reliable form
10340.312 of contraception.
10341.02 CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]
10342.21 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yes, please don't.
10343.99 I have a final
question, which relates
10347.38 to something that is very much
starting to get buzz now--
10352.48 and maybe more so
for people that
10354.16 hang out in the Twitter
space or the nutrition space.
10356.92 But there's a new
class of drugs that I
10359.71 think initially were
developed to treat diabetes
10364.03 but are now being evaluated
for their efficacy
10367.84 to treat obesity.
10369.22 And these are the semaglutide
drugs that are involved in--
10377.98 they tap into these glucagon
related GLP-1 pathways.
10382.03 And it is a story that we've
talked about a little bit
10385.39 on the podcast before.
10386.38 But many people, I
imagine, probably
10387.97 haven't heard that conversation.
10389.5 I would simply like to know what
you think about these drugs.
10393.37 They obviously adjust the way
that glucose and insulin are
10397.39 managing energy, both in
the body and the brain,
10400.96 and can produce weight loss.
10402.91 So that to me, when I look
at the data, it's impressive.
10406.33 But a good logical shift
in diet and exercise
10412.75 could achieve
similar weight loss.
10414.28 But a lot of people
just won't do that.
10415.905 So the question I have
is, what are your thoughts
10418.57 on semaglutide and other GLP--
10420.818 I think I might have said
GLT before, excuse me--
10422.86 GLP-1 related compounds?
10426.16 And do you ever prescribe
these in conjunction
10430.03 with these dietary shifts?
10431.47 Because it seems
to me, they would
10432.97 fall right in with the
catalog of other approaches
10436.39 that you have available.
10439.155 CHRIS PALMER: The
real answer is,
10440.53 I am not at all an expert
on these medications.
10444.558 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But what
are your thoughts about them?
10446.85 They seem to be
weight loss drugs,
10448.44 not unlike the fen-phen
drugs of the '90s that
10451.56 then were banned because a few
people didn't handle them well.
10454.682 CHRIS PALMER: They are.
10459.33 We had fen-phen.
10460.5 And even before
that, in the 1950s,
10462.72 and '60s, and '70s, Dexedrine--
10465.142 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine.
10466.35 CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine--
10467.04 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mother's little helper.
10467.97 CHRIS PALMER: --was,
yes, was the treatment
10469.92 of choice for women
across the United States
10473.49 to keep their slim figures.
10475.95 And we created addicts
and all sorts of problems.
10480.33 But they were widely used and
probably millions of women
10484.05 because they work.
10486.127 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because
they kill appetite.
10487.96 CHRIS PALMER: They
kill appetite.
10494.57 My overall thoughts are this.
10496.7 There is zero doubt in my
mind that the obesity epidemic
10502.94 is a threat to human health and
potentially the human species.
10508.69 If it keeps going at
the rate it's going,
10511.54 it is a threat to our species.
10515.88 We have to figure out what
on Earth is happening,
10518.73 and what can we do about it.
10523.3 These medications,
in early studies,
10527.49 are highly effective
over a year or two.
10534.31 That's promising.
10537.55 I am worried, though,
that we're not attacking
10541.57 the root cause of obesity.
10546.4 If the root cause
of obesity ends up
10549.31 being some kind of poisoning
of the metabolic machinery
10555.77 in the brain or body--
10558.08 and I would argue that probably
relates to mitochondrial health
10562.16 and mitochondrial function--
10564.86 I have every reason to believe
that taking a medication that
10570.01 helps you lose weight may not
be addressing that problem.
10577.41 And therefore, may
not be addressing
10580.38 all of the negative health
consequences of what
10584.01 we call obesity.
10587.4 So obesity, in it
of itself, we know
10589.68 that excess fat can
become inflammatory
10593.55 and can cause problems,
in and of itself.
10596.04 But I actually see
obesity as a symptom.
10600.75 I see obesity as a symptom
of metabolic derangement
10604.41 in the body or brain.
10607.04 And that is why
people become obese.
10610.63 And that if we're really
going to get anywhere,
10612.73 we need to identify
what is causing
10614.89 that metabolic derangement.
10617.82 Using a symptomatic treatment
like a GLP-1 medication,
10628.23 to the best of my
knowledge, is not addressing
10630.6 that core problem.
10632.82 And we're just ignoring it.
10635.55 Maybe I'll be wrong.
10637.05 And maybe these will
be the wonder drug that
10639.84 saved the human
species, and everybody
10642.15 will be thin and healthy
forever and ever.
10646.33 I'm not hopeful, because
we've never-- we've
10649.59 had so many promising
drugs come along.
10653.22 Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,
and other things,
10655.5 we've had so many
promising drugs.
10659.81 And at the end of
the day, when you
10661.28 try to muck with
human metabolism using
10663.59 a single processed
molecule, manmade,
10668.96 I can't think of even one
example where it's been great
10675.65 for large numbers of people.
10678.56 Certainly,
manufacturing insulin is
10681.05 life-saving for people
with type 1 diabetes.
10684.33 So that would be an example.
10686.45 But giving massive
doses of insulin
10688.76 to people with type 2 diabetes,
actually is a downward spiral.
10693.76 I would much rather see people
with type 2 diabetes control
10696.55 their diabetes through
diet and lifestyle.
10699.01 And that might be a ketogenic
diet, or a low carb diet,
10701.96 or exercise or good sleep,
or all of the other thing.
10705.85 All of it.
10707.46 I'd much rather see
that because when
10709.26 people try to control their
type 2 diabetes with a molecule,
10712.3 even though it's a
natural molecule insulin,
10714.84 we know that thats results
in really poor health
10718.26 consequences, results
in higher rates
10720.87 of cardiovascular
disease, higher
10722.46 rates of mental
disorders, higher
10724.32 rates of premature mortality.
10726.75 Do I think GLP-1 molecules
are going to be different?
10731.46 No.
10732.0 I don't have any reason to
think they are going to be.
10735.36 So that would be my two
cents, but we'll see.
10739.15 Time will tell.
10740.297 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will tell.
10741.63 Meanwhile, I want to
thank you for doing
10745.08 what is, without
question, pioneering work.
10750.75 Again, I'm not a clinician.
10752.25 But I've been around
this space long enough
10755.64 to know that indeed there
there are no wonder drugs.
10759.57 There are drugs that certainly
can help alleviate symptoms
10762.78 in some individuals.
10764.98 But that lifestyle and in
the case of your work--
10768.89 in particular, in the
discussion today--
10770.63 diet and, the ketogenic diet,
in particular, it's clear,
10775.82 can have incredible
effects, miraculous effects,
10778.82 in some individuals.
10780.32 And positive effects
in others that
10782.66 might not be of
the same magnitude
10784.25 but nonetheless are
extremely important,
10786.84 so on behalf of myself, and the
listeners, and and certainly,
10791.18 just on behalf of everybody out
there-- because everyone does
10795.29 need to be concerned about
mental health issues,
10797.908 whether or not they have them
and in their family themselves.
10800.45 Or otherwise, because
they impact everybody.
10802.61 Just really want to thank
you for viewing the work
10804.693 that you're doing because
it really is pioneering.
10807.44 And it's brave.
10808.82 And I can see now, based on our
discussion, why it would work.
10815.54 You've given us a lot of hints
into the underlying mechanisms
10819.48 that suggest as to
why it would work.
10821.58 And you're going to
given us examples
10823.38 as to how it has worked
in patients that you've
10826.2 worked with.
10826.74 And this field is
expanding fast.
10829.17 I think this is an area
of psychiatry and medicine
10831.87 in general.
10832.492 Meaning, behavioral,
nutritional interventions,
10834.45 that is expanding very fast.
10836.16 So thank you for being brave and
for taking this on, and doing
10840.72 it in such a structured way,
and for communicating it
10843.39 here today.
10843.89 And with the general
public, through your book,
10845.848 and your online presence.
10847.02 We will certainly point
people in the direction
10848.978 of those valuable resources.
10851.26 Thanks so much.
10852.03 CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, I know.
10852.43 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I appreciate it.
10853.18 CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew,
for being brave and having me
10855.763 on your [LAUGHS] show--
10856.847 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And a pleasure.
10858.18 CHRIS PALMER: --and for
a great conversation.
10860.132 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank you for
joining me for my discussion
10862.59 with Dr. Chris Palmer.
10863.94 I hope you found it to be
as informative, actionable,
10866.94 and exciting in terms of
the various treatments
10869.61 that we can now think about
when considering treatments
10873.0 for psychiatric disorders.
10874.38 Once again, if you're interested
in his work or his new book,
10877.2 Brain Energy, I encourage
you to go to his website.
10880.02 That's chrispalmermd.com.

the book Brain Energy
10883.59 by Chris Palmer on Amazon
and other sites where
10885.84 books are sold.
10886.69 And we provide links to the
book and to Dr. Palmer's website
10889.77 in the show note captions.

10921.0 During today's episode, we
did not discuss supplements.
10923.52 But on many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab podcast,
10926.4 we do discuss supplements
because while supplements
10929.16 aren't necessary for
everybody, many people
10931.29 derive tremendous
benefit from them
10932.82 for things like enhancing
sleep, and focus, and hormone
10935.37 augmentation, and so forth.
10936.787 The Huberman Lab
podcast has partnered
10938.37 with Momentous Supplements
because they are
10940.68 of the very highest quality.
10942.33 And they ship internationally.
10943.943 And in addition
to that, they have
10945.36 single-ingredient
formulations that
10947.19 allow you to devise the
supplement regimen that's
10949.8 most effective and most
cost effective for you.
10952.203 If you'd like to see the
supplements discussed
10954.12 on the Huberman Lab
podcast, please go
10956.16 to LiveMomentous.com/Huberman.

science-related tools
10995.873 for mental health, physical
health, and performance.
10998.04 Some of which overlap
with information
10999.99 covered on the
Huberman Lab podcast.
11001.67 But often which is distinct
from information covered
11004.43 on the Huberman Lab podcast.
11005.66 So again, that's Huberman
Lab on Instagram, Twitter,
11008.01 and Facebook.
11008.84 Once again, thank
