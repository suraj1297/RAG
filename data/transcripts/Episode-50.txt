0.37 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.35 where we discuss science
and science based tools
4.93 for everyday life.
9.27 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.21 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
12.92 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.73 Today, we are going to discuss sugar,
16.89 in particular, how our
nervous system regulates
18.99 our sugar intake and our
are seeking of sugar.
22.13 We're also going to discuss how sugar
24.33 regulates our nervous system.
25.84 And as you'll soon learn,
27.28 sugar really impacts our brain and body
29.09 by two main mechanisms.
30.95 One of those mechanisms is based on
32.62 the sweet taste of sugar,
which itself is rewarding.
35.97 Even if you're not much of a sweet tooth,
37.66 I confess I'm not,
39.09 most people enjoy sweet tastes
more than bitter tastes.
43.13 And the sweet taste of
sugar and its various forms,
46.94 is strongly reinforcing,
48.51 meaning it triggers the
activation of neurons,
50.82 nerve cells in the brain and body,
52.33 that make us want to consume
more of that sweet substance.
56.07 Incidentally, sweet tastes also
make us want to eat more of
59.49 other substances as well.
61.17 You may be familiar with that phenomenon.
62.98 Now sugar also triggers
mechanisms in the brain and body
65.84 based on its nutritive content,
67.9 independent of its sweetness.
69.72 What that means is that
the actual caloric content
74.05 and the way that sugar interacts
with your nervous system
76.82 at a subconscious level,
without your awareness,
79.91 also impacts your craving and seeking
82.06 of sugar and other foods.
84.5 Today, we are going to
discuss what happens
86.53 when you ingest sugar in
terms of your body's reaction
90.06 and your brain's reaction.
91.67 We are also going to
talk about what happens
93.07 when you don't ingest enough sugar.
95.43 'Cause it turns out sugar
is such a powerful fuel
98.5 for the brain
99.34 that under conditions
where people don't ingest
101.43 enough sugar, or where their
so-called blood glucose,
104.4 which is basically blood
sugar of a particular form
107.0 gets too low, their neurons
don't function as well.
110.7 That said, there are conditions
of very low blood sugar
113.53 in which neurons can function even better.
116.23 So today we are going to
talk about the ins and outs,
118.58 the ups and downs of sugar
119.98 as it relates to your nervous system.
121.48 And by the end of this episode,
122.94 I'm confident that you
have a much clearer picture
125.34 as to how much sugar
you should be ingesting,
128.61 whether or not you should avoid sugars
130.44 that you're currently eating,
131.74 and you will certainly
understand much, much more
134.34 about the energy and fuel sources
that your brain relies on,
137.77 which I'm certain will allow you to make
139.75 better informed choices about
the foods you eat and avoid
142.61 toward mental health, physical
health, and performance.
145.33 I'm pleased to announce that
I'm hosting two live events
147.98 this May.
148.98 The first live event will be
hosted in Seattle, Washington
151.72 on May 17th.
153.2 The second live event will be hosted
154.8 in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.
157.2 Both are part of a lecture series entitled
159.21 The Brain-Body Contract,
160.77 during which I will discuss
science and science based tools
163.83 for mental health, physical
health and performance.
166.44 And I should point out that
while some of the material
168.89 I'll cover will overlap with
information covered here
171.56 on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
172.987 and on various social media posts.
175.01 Most of the information I will
cover is going to be distinct
178.19 from information covered on
the podcast or elsewhere.
181.08 So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,
183.61 Portland on May 18th,
184.94 you can access tickets by
going to Hubermanlab.com/tour.
189.02 And I hope to see you there.
190.52 Before we begin,
191.4 I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
193.03 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
195.63 It is however part of my desire and effort
197.52 to bring zero cost consumer information
199.49 about science and science related tools
201.39 to the general public.
202.74 In keeping with that theme,
204.0 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
206.74 Our first sponsor is Thesis.
208.75 Thesis makes what are called nootropics,
211.05 which means smart drugs.
212.8 Now, to be honest,
213.633 I am not a fan of the term nootropics,
216.13 I don't believe in smart drugs
218.07 in the sense that I don't believe
219.24 that there's any one substance
or collection of substances
222.09 that can make us smarter.
223.78 I do believe, based on science, however,
226.13 that there are particular neural circuits
227.67 and brain functions that
allow us to be more focused,
230.21 more alert, access creativity,
be more motivated, et cetera.
233.93 That's just the way that the brain works,
235.33 different neural circuits
for different brain states.
237.84 And so the idea of a nootropic
that's to make us smarter
240.32 all around,
241.153 fails to acknowledge that
smarter is many things.
244.26 If you're an artist, you're a musician,
245.64 you're doing math,
you're doing accounting,
247.73 at different parts of the
day, you need to be creative.
249.38 These are all different brain processes.
251.6 Thesis understands this.
253.09 And as far as I know they're
the first nootropics company
255.44 to create targeted nootropics
for specific outcomes.
258.72 They only use the highest
quality ingredients,
260.28 which of course is essential.
261.62 Some of those I've talked
about on the podcast,
263.31 things like DHA, Ginkgo
biloba, phosphatidylserine.
267.2 They give you the ability to
try several different blends
269.27 over the course of a month,
270.53 discover which nootropics work best
272.27 for your unique brain chemistry
and genetics and goals.
275.56 And with that personalization,
277.5 design a kit of nootropics
279.46 that's ideal for the different
brain and body states
281.81 you want to access.
282.86 I've been using Thesis for
more than six months now,
285.16 and I can confidently
say that their nootropics
286.743 have been a total game changer.
288.78 My go-to formula is the Clarity Formula,
291.46 or sometimes I'll use their
Energy Formula, before training.
294.6 To get your own personalized
nootropic starter kit,
296.63 go online to take thesis.com/huberman.
299.56 Take a three minute quiz
300.56 and Thesis will send you

310.01 Today's episode is also brought to us
311.5 by Athletic Greens, now called AG1.
314.44 Athletic Greens is an all in one
316.01 vitamin, mineral and probiotic drink.
318.41 I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,
321.28 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
323.73 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens
325.197 and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens
326.87 once or twice a day is
that it helps me cover
329.15 all of my basic nutritional needs.
330.91 It makes up for any
deficiencies that I might have.
333.41 In addition, it has probiotics,
335.42 which are vital for microbiome health.
338.03 I've done a couple of
episodes now on the so-called
340.66 gut microbiome and in the ways in which
343.28 the microbiome interacts
with your immune system,
345.75 with your brain to regulate mood,
347.65 and essentially with
every biological system
349.81 relevant to health throughout
your brain and body.
352.57 With Athletic Greens, I
get the vitamins I need,
354.35 the minerals I need,
355.35 and the probiotics to
support my microbiome.
358.13 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
359.52 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
362.17 and claim a special offer.
363.64 They'll give you five free travel packs,
365.41 which make it easy to
mix up Athletic Greens
367.13 while you're on the road.
368.26 Plus a years supply of Vitamin D3+K2.
372.113 There are ton of data now
showing that vitamin D3
373.9 is essential for various aspects
375.73 of our brain and body health.
377.02 Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine,
379.12 many of us are still
deficient in vitamin D3.
381.5 And K2 is also important
because it regulates things like
384.07 cardiovascular function,
calcium in the body, and so on.
387.47 Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
390.27 to claim the special offer
of the five free travel packs
392.75 and the year's supply of Vitamin D3+K2.
395.47 Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
398.47 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
401.07 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
403.69 to help you better understand your body
405.26 and help you reach your health goals.
407.15 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
409.92 for the simple reason
that many of the factors
412.26 that impact your immediate
and long term health
414.32 can only be assessed with
a quality blood test.
416.85 What's unique about InsideTracker
418.05 is that while there are a lot
of different tests out there
420.72 for hormones and metabolic
factors, et cetera,
423.41 with InsideTracker,
424.243 you get the numbers back
in terms of your levels,
426.54 but they also give you
very clear directives
428.56 in terms of lifestyle,
nutrition, and supplementation,
431.27 that can help you bring
those values into the ranges
433.9 that are best for you
and your health goals.
435.98 And that's very different than
a lot of the other programs
438.22 where you get a lot of information,
439.053 but you don't really know what
to do with that information.
441.38 InsideTracker makes that
all very easy to understand
444.04 and very actionable based
on the very easy to use
446.93 dashboard at InsideTracker.

457.58 Okay, let's talk about sugar,
459.3 let's talk about how
sugar impacts your brain,
461.63 and how your brain impacts
your pursuit or your avoidance
464.8 of sugar.
466.31 Let's get a few things
out of the way first.
468.44 The first thing is that there's nothing
470.15 inherently bad about sugar.
472.41 I know the word sugar
gets a bad rap nowadays,
475.4 and indeed, you're going to
hear over and over again,
477.68 during this podcast,
478.87 that consuming a lot of refined sugars,
481.34 in particular high fructose corn syrup,
483.68 is known to have a very
large number of bad effects
487.41 on the brain and body.
488.33 I don't know that there's anyone
489.49 that really debates that anymore.
491.71 Even if we just agree, and
I think we should all agree,
495.47 on the so-called calories in,
calories out principle, right?
498.81 It's a principle thermodynamics
500.38 that if we ingest more
energy than we burn,
503.44 we are going to gain weight.
504.56 If we ingest less energy than we burn,
507.43 we are generally going to lose weight.
509.17 And if the two things are in balance,
511.4 ingestion and burning of energy,
514.38 well, then we're going to maintain weight.
516.61 So everyone agrees on
that, I agree on that.
519.16 But beyond, there are a number of ways
521.67 in which particular nutrients,
523.48 in the case of today's episode, sugar,
525.82 impact the way that the brain works,
528.46 such that we tend to seek out
more of particular nutrients.
532.41 For instance, if we eat sugar,
534.74 there are two, or at least two mechanisms,
537.42 by which we will crave more sugar.
539.53 I think most people are
aware of that experience,
541.18 but today I'm going to explain
exactly how that works.
543.69 But also that when we ingest sugar
546.6 it has a bunch of different effects
548.25 on the way that our neural circuits work
550.97 that can allow us to be
more or less focused,
553.58 more or less agitated,
a more or less happy,
556.32 more or less depressed in some cases.
559.77 So today, as we explore this
thing we're calling sugar,
561.937 we are going to explore
that mainly in the context
564.68 of the nervous system,
566.06 but also in the context of how
567.72 the nervous system regulates
569.11 many, many functions and behaviors
571.29 that are important to all of you,
573.33 your ability to think,
your ability to extra size,
575.53 your ability to gain weight, lose weight,
577.34 whatever your goals might happen to be,
579.66 sugar plays a critical role
in achieving those goals.
582.85 And in some cases,
584.2 if you're ingesting too
much at the wrong times
586.16 or the wrong forms, sugar can
actually impede those goals.
589.62 In fact, sugar can prevent
all the right behaviors
592.62 from allowing you to achieve
the goals that you want.
595.47 So today we are going to place sugar
597.0 into its proper context.
599.07 The way I want to start off by doing that
601.13 is to tell you a little bit
of what happens when we eat
604.26 and a little bit of what the brain does
606.84 to respond to those events.
609.49 So what happens when we eat?
610.9 Well, I've done an entire
episode on metabolism.
614.52 So if you're interested
in the full cascade
617.72 of hormonal and neural events
that occurs when we eat,
620.86 please check out that episode.
622.41 But for the sake of today's discussion,
624.05 let's just take a, what
I call top contour view
626.94 of the hormonal response
to ingesting food.
630.2 Now, anytime we eat,
631.76 that is the consequence
of a number of things
633.51 that happened before we ate.
636.01 There's a own in our
brain body called Ghrelin,
638.53 spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.
640.99 Ghrelin is a hormone that increases
644.09 depending on how long it's
been since we ate last.
646.89 So the longer it's been
since we had a meal,
649.75 Ghrelin levels are going to be
higher and higher and higher,
652.68 and it essentially makes us hungry
654.36 by interacting with particular neurons
656.81 in an area of the brain called
657.927 the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus
660.42 and some other areas as well,
like the lateral hypothalamus.
663.8 You don't need to know the
names of those brain areas,
665.43 but if you'd like to
know them, there they are
668.39 Ghrelin increases, it
tends to make us hungry.
671.58 And then when we eat,
673.5 typically what happens is
Ghrelin levels go down.
676.51 So it's a very logical system.
678.26 Now, when we eat, assuming
that we eat carbohydrates,
682.21 but even if we just eat
some protein and some fats,
685.0 we will experience a
slight, or in some cases,
688.5 a large rise in blood glucose,
691.06 blood glucose is simply blood sugar.
693.7 And the body and brain, we
should say in particular,
697.71 the nervous system doesn't function well
700.06 if blood sugar is too high or too low.
702.31 So as a consequence, we
have another hormone,
704.37 which is released from the pancreas,
705.69 which is called insulin,
706.84 which helps regulate the amount of glucose
709.67 in the bloodstream.
710.63 So even if you were to
ingest an entire cup,
713.89 an eight ounce cup of pure table sugar,
716.09 which would send your blood
glucose very, very high,
718.69 assuming that you have a
normal insulin response,
720.54 that you're not diabetic,
722.35 that insulin response would help clamp
724.52 that blood glucose level
so that it did not cause
727.48 damage to your brain and body.
729.76 Because if blood sugar goes too high,
731.33 it's actually toxic to neurons
and other cells of your body,
734.15 it can kill them off.
735.16 And neurons of the central nervous system,
737.32 meaning the brain and spinal cord,
738.45 once they are dead, they do not come back.
740.35 So your biological systems understand this
743.58 at a biological level that is,
745.29 and prevent that death of
cells due to high blood sugar,
748.63 by keeping insulin around,
751.38 in order to clamp blood glucose.
753.54 Diabetics, we call them
type one diabetics,
755.71 who don't make insulin,
756.86 have to take insulin when
they eat in particular,
758.98 when they eat foods that
raise their blood sugar,
760.98 specifically to avoid that neurotoxicity
762.777 and the other deleterious
effects of high blood sugar.
765.66 So Ghrelin is a hormone that goes up
767.38 the longer it's been since we've eaten,
769.11 it tends to stimulate hunger.
771.25 When we eat, Ghrelin is suppressed.
773.68 Blood glucose typically goes up,
775.54 especially when we eat a
carbohydrate containing meal.
779.29 When blood glucose goes up,
it's regulated in the body,
782.47 meaning its peaks and its valleys
784.77 are more or less smoothed out,
786.65 and that glucose is sequestered,
788.43 it's taken away where it
needs to be taken away.
791.02 And in certain locations,
it's delivered to cells
793.39 so that those cells can use the glucose.
795.99 Now, one of the chief organs
for glucose utilization
799.24 is the brain,
800.62 neurons are tremendously
metabolically active.
803.79 And their preferred mode of metabolism
807.44 is glucose metabolism.
808.85 In other words, neurons
basically run on sugar,
812.05 which is not to say that you
should eat a lot of sugar.
814.67 As you'll see today, there
are states of mind and body,
817.84 for instance, fasted states,
819.54 in which people report
having immense amounts
822.58 of mental clarity and their blood glucose
824.95 is actually quite low.
826.37 So it is simply not the
case that the more sugar
829.0 that you ingest, the better
that your brain will function.
831.73 But it is the case that for most people,
833.96 meaning people who are not on a ketogenic
835.75 or very low carbohydrate diet,
837.35 they're not adapted to
low carbohydrate diets,
839.5 that neurons in their brain and body
842.1 are using glucose in order to function.
844.1 That's what allows those neurons
845.34 to fire electrical potentials,
that's how we refer to it,
847.77 firing, meaning sending electrical
signals down their length
851.1 to communicate with other neurons.
853.26 To illustrate just how
important glucose is
855.49 for brain function,
856.94 I'd like to describe a study
that just recently came out,
860.36 that sits on a long
history of similar studies.
863.14 But the one that just came out
is particularly interesting.
865.6 Now I want to point out
that, unless I say otherwise,
870.02 I'm going to refer to typical diets,
872.82 meaning I have to believe
that most people out there
875.68 are in ingesting some starch
some starch or carbohydrate.
877.99 I do realize there are people following
879.59 very low carbohydrate diets
881.16 or moderately carbohydrate diets.
882.69 I even know that there's
some folks out there
883.97 who are on the so-called carnivore diet,
885.62 they only eat meat and
organs, maybe a little fruit.
888.6 But I'm going to assume
that the vast majority
890.7 of people listening ingest
proteins and carbohydrates.
895.13 So unless I say ketogenic, or
I emphasize ketosis itself,
898.92 which I will,
899.89 I'm referring to a kind of typical diet
901.45 where people are consuming fats,
proteins and carbohydrates.
904.56 I count myself as one such individual.
907.72 At some point I might try the
carnivore diet, who knows,
910.04 I might I a pure vegan diet, who knows.
912.72 But for my entire life up
until now, I'm 46 years old,
915.76 I've been a proud omnivore,
917.67 meaning I've tried to eat
high quality as much as I can,
921.02 unprocessed foods,
922.08 I try and really avoid
highly processed foods.
923.96 But I do eat from those
three macronutrient groups,
926.24 proteins, carbohydrates, and fats,
928.19 and I'm going to assume
that most of you do as well.
930.86 The study I'd like to emphasize,
933.89 recorded from neurons, nerve cells,
936.12 in the brain, in particular
in the part of the brain
939.297 `that responds to visual images,
941.7 the so called visual cortex.
943.22 And neurons in the visual
cortex are beautifully tuned,
947.34 as we say, to particular
features of what we see.
952.05 The primary example of this,
952.883 the kind of classic example,
955.06 is if you put a little
electrode next to a neuron
957.62 in your visual cortex,
959.26 or if we put you into
an FMRI scanner machine,
963.08 which can detect neural activity,
964.59 and I were to show you a
bunch of just little lines,
968.93 bars of light, they could
be dark bars of light,
970.81 they could be light bars of light,
973.47 on a screen in front of you.
974.69 So some would be vertical,
some would be horizontal,
976.64 some would be at 45 degrees,
978.41 what we would see is that
some neurons respond best,
983.17 meaning they fire a lot
of electrical activity
985.8 to vertical lines,
986.74 other ones respond to horizontal lines,
988.79 and others respond to 45 degree lines.
991.67 And this so called orientation tuning,
994.27 meaning because of the
orientation of the line,
996.1 is a cardinal classic feature of the way
999.32 that your visual system is built.
1001.18 And everything that you see,
1003.59 whether it's a face or a
dog or a cat or a landscape,
1007.01 is built up from these very
simple neuron responses.
1011.21 In other words, when you look at a face,
1013.62 there are neurons deep in the
brain that respond to faces.
1016.17 But the only reason that those neurons
1017.95 can respond to those faces
1019.24 is because they receive
signals from neurons
1021.21 in your visual cortex.
1022.85 Some of which respond to vertical lines,
1024.5 some of which respond to horizontal lines,
1025.837 and some which respond to 45 degree lines.
1028.26 And all of those are built up
1030.06 in what we call a
hierarchical representation,
1032.03 which just fancy language for
those are the building blocks
1034.23 by which you see a face
and you recognize a face.
1036.71 And it's really an amazing phenomenon,
1038.2 it happens very, very fast.
1039.76 You never notice that you're doing this,
1041.46 but everything is built up from these
1042.75 fundamental orientation-tuned neurons.
1046.08 Now orientation-tuned
neurons are so fundamental
1050.12 that they are the building blocks
1051.87 by which you make up all
other things that you see,
1054.95 it's the way you read,
1055.783 it's the way that you recognize
faces, as I mentioned,
1058.08 and everything else.
1061.03 Experimentally, it's quite straightforward
1063.2 to measure how sharply tuned
one of these neurons is.
1067.23 In other words, if I were
to show you a vertical line
1070.33 and find a neuron in your brain
1071.73 that responds to vertical lines,
1073.65 I could also ask whether
or not that neuron fires
1077.49 any electrical activity
in response to a line
1080.65 that's not quite vertical,
1082.17 maybe just 10 degrees off
vertical or 20 degrees
1085.21 or 30 degrees.
1086.11 And what I eventually would
find is that that neuron
1088.67 was orientation-tuned over a
particular range of angles.
1093.1 It's not only going to
respond to vertical lines,
1095.27 it's also going to respond to lines
1096.61 that are about 10 degrees
off vertical on either side,
1099.33 but probably not much more, maybe 20,
1102.28 but usually it's going to
be anywhere from vertical
1105.06 to just tilted slightly.
1108.903 In the recent experiment
that was published
1110.94 in the journal, "Neuron,"
Cell Press journal,
1112.57 excellent journal,
1113.92 the authors asked a really
interesting question,
1116.2 they asked whether or not
the sharpness of tuning,
1118.96 the precision of orientation
tuning of these neurons
1121.98 is dependent on blood glucose level.
1124.82 So just to cut to the chase,
to give you the answer,
1127.13 what they found is that
when subjects are well fed,
1131.25 neurons that responded to vertical,
1133.22 responded very strongly to vertical,
1135.07 but not very much at all to other angles,
1137.87 of what we call stimuli,
1139.7 so lines that are 10
degrees or 20 degrees off.
1143.14 If they looked at neurons that
were primarily tuned, right,
1146.39 that preferred horizontal lines,
they found the same thing.
1149.8 So it wasn't something
unique to vertical lines.
1151.42 What they basically
found was the sharpness,
1153.69 the precision of tuning
of neurons in the brain,
1156.55 was best when subjects were fed.
1159.89 And conversely, when subjects were fasted,
1162.92 the orientation tuning of these
neurons became much broader.
1167.64 What it meant was that a neuron
1169.04 that normally would
only respond to vertical
1171.01 now responded to other
angles of lines as well.
1173.76 You might say, well, that's great, right,
1175.3 these neurons that at one
point could only do one thing
1177.1 are now tuned to other things.
1178.16 But it's not so great
because what that means
1181.1 is that in the fasted state,
1183.62 your perception of the outside
world is actually distorted,
1187.53 it's blurred, it's not as
precise as it is when you're fed.
1191.28 And when I say fed,
1192.45 what I really mean is when
glucose is available to neurons.
1195.55 Now, for some of you, maybe many of you,
1198.43 and including myself,
intermittent fasting,
1201.38 or some variant thereof, is
actually a state that I like.
1204.21 It allows me to focus.
1205.25 For instance, as I mentioned before,
1206.95 and even earlier in this podcast,
1208.19 I tend to eat my first meal
sometime around 11:00 AM.
1211.7 And then I generally eat my last meal
1213.82 sometime around 8:00 PM,
plus or minus an hour
1216.0 on either side, I'm not
super strict about it.
1217.61 And occasionally I'll
wake up really hungry
1219.01 and I'll eat something before 11:00 AM.
1220.55 I'm not super strict about this
intermittent fasting thing.
1223.95 It just seems to be how
my appetite works best,
1226.29 given my schedule, et cetera.
1229.43 In the morning, I tend to be most focused.
1231.93 And I always associated that with the fact
1234.22 that I was fasted.
1235.27 I ingest water and some caffeine about
1237.37 90 minutes after waking
up, I drink my caffeine,
1239.47 but I hydrate from the time I
get up, et cetera, et cetera.
1241.8 And I know a lot of other people
1243.8 have had the experience of being fasted
1245.86 and feeling like they have
a lot of mental clarity.
1248.49 When you are in a fasted state,
1250.34 typically you are going to use fuels
1253.01 that are available to the neurons,
1254.87 based on your intake
of food the day before,
1257.94 maybe you're using some glycogen,
1259.73 maybe you're using some fat,
1261.32 maybe you're using some blood sugar,
1263.25 that's derived from other
storage sites in the body.
1266.15 You don't actually use
fat as a fuel source
1269.49 for neurons under typical conditions.
1271.52 But there are ways in
which proteins and fats
1273.83 and glycogen, et cetera,
are converted into fuel
1276.6 that neurons can use.
1278.17 What's interesting about this study
1279.69 is that the study says that when well fed,
1283.29 meaning when blood glucose, sugar,
1285.86 is at a properly elevated
level in the bloodstream,
1290.5 it can be delivered to the brain
1292.2 in a way that allows neurons to work best,
1294.15 which is really all just
to underscore the point
1296.23 that I made earlier,
1297.063 which is that your nervous system
1298.33 is extremely metabolically
demanding, and it loves glucose,
1301.93 neurons love glucose.
1304.15 So the takeaway from this study
1306.03 is not that you should avoid fasting,
1308.02 the takeaway from this study
1308.96 is that there are elements
of the fasted state
1311.34 in particular the elevations in things
1312.82 like epinephrine and norepinephrine,
1314.47 also called adrenaline and noradrenaline,
1316.68 that can give us this
kind of clarity of mind
1318.873 that many people are
pursuing when they fast.
1321.56 That's kind of one of the
reasons a lot of people fast,
1323.41 they like the way that they
feel, mentally and physically.
1326.54 But I think it's only fair to point out
1329.52 that glucose is the preferred
source of fuel for the brain.
1332.4 And this study that I mentioned
is one of many studies
1335.41 that have explored how nutritional status
1337.73 or blood glucose status
in the brain and body
1340.13 influence neuronal tuning
and neuronal function.
1343.28 And it really points to
the fact that ultimately,
1346.96 your brain as an organ, is
a glucose consuming machine.
1351.07 Now, when you eat a food,
1354.16 that food is broken down and
if it contains carbohydrates,
1357.68 it's going to be converted into glucose.
1359.46 And that glucose can't get
directly into the brain
1361.67 as a fuel source.
1362.503 It actually has to be carried across
1363.83 the so-called blood
brain barrier, the BBB,
1366.7 and the actual metabolism of glucose
1370.13 and the delivery of the
glucose to the neurons
1372.41 is carried out by a different cell type.
1374.38 And it's a cell type that
you should all know about
1376.14 because it's the most abundant
cell type in your brain,
1379.38 and maybe even in your
entire nervous system,
1381.16 and that's the so-called astrocyte.
1383.22 Astrocytes are one of
several types of glia,
1386.41 the word glia means glue.
1388.12 But many people have taken
that name, glia, glue,
1391.63 to think that, oh,
1392.74 the only thing that the
astrocytes are doing
1393.643 is just kind of holding things together.
1395.5 Actually, the astrocytes
are involved in delivering
1398.17 glucose to the neurons,
1399.7 they are critically involved in shaping
1401.76 your neuronal function
and brain plasticity,
1404.01 the brain's ability to change
in response to experience.
1406.2 So these astrocytes are like the little
1407.75 waiters and waitresses
bringing glucose to the neurons
1410.777 and the neurons are going
to do the heavy lifting
1412.57 that's involved in perception
and behavior and action.
1416.29 So if prior to this episode,
1417.62 you didn't already realize
that glucose, blood sugar,
1420.81 is vital to the function of your brain
1423.53 and other neurons of your
nervous system, now you know.
1426.93 And for those of you that have experienced
1429.66 the increase in mental clarity
1432.18 that comes after a properly
timed, properly composed,
1437.35 meaning it has the right
macronutrients in the right ratios,
1439.65 and a properly sized meal,
1441.73 well then now you have justification
1443.56 for eating something as
a way to improve the way
1446.54 that your brain works.
1447.373 It turns out that your
brain is going to work best
1449.06 when it's got glucose available,
1450.85 whether you like to fast or not,
1452.35 that's just the reality of things.
1453.88 The same thing is also true
for the neurons in your body.
1457.41 The way that you are able to
move the limbs of your body,
1459.77 the way you are able to perform exercise
1462.65 or movement of any kind for that matter,
1464.8 is because as neurons,
called motor neurons,
1467.43 send electrical potentials
to the muscle fibers,
1470.21 they release a neurotransmitter
called acetylcholine,
1472.57 which causes contraction
in the muscle fibers,
1474.48 and allows you to move your limbs.
1476.73 Those neurons are also very
metabolically demanding,
1479.59 especially when you're doing
1481.21 demanding types of physical work,
1482.627 and that could be cycling
or running or weightlifting
1484.57 or yoga or whatever it may be.
1486.94 Those neurons require a ton of glucose.
1490.44 If you've ever had the
experience of having to
1492.46 think very hard about how
you're generating a movement
1495.38 or force yourself to continue
to endure in a given exercise,
1499.45 you might have thought,
1500.283 oh, you know, I'm running out of fuel,
1501.96 that's why I'm getting
tired, it's hard to do.
1504.32 That's actually the case sometimes,
1506.44 but that's not always the case.
1509.12 One of the reasons that it feels like work
1511.31 is because your so called
upper motor neurons,
1513.37 the ones that control
the lower motor neurons
1514.96 in your spinal cord, which
control your muscles,
1517.21 they have to be very metabolically active.
1519.11 It's one thing to engage
in a reflexive movement
1521.17 where you're just walking around
1522.22 or if you're running continuously.
1523.82 But when you suddenly have to
focus on what you're doing,
1525.99 and you have to generate specific patterns
1527.82 of motor movement,
1528.88 well, that feels demanding because one,
1532.44 it increases the release of adrenaline
1534.15 in your brain and body,
1534.983 which makes you feel a little
bit agitated and more alert,
1537.2 but also deliberate thought,
1540.18 deliberately controlling the way
1541.75 that your brain and body is moving,
1543.93 requires more glucose uptake,
1545.82 more energy in those very neurons.
1548.0 And this is also why after
doing a long about of exercise,
1550.7 you might be tired,
1551.533 but also if you do a about of
skill learning of any kind,
1555.75 or if you've been reading
and thinking about
1557.55 what you're reading,
1558.62 or if you had a intense
conversation with somebody
1561.45 where you're really
forcing yourself to listen,
1564.0 and hopefully they're
listening to you too,
1565.46 and you're really trying to
parse what they're saying,
1567.12 and maybe you're doing that right now,
1568.39 and you're trying to really
track something, that's work,
1571.007 and that work requires
glucose uptake by neurons,
1573.65 both in the brain and in your body.
1575.62 Now that we've established that glucose
1577.11 is the preferred source of
fuel for the nervous system,
1580.54 I'd like to concentrate on
a few of the other types of
1583.61 sugars that we ingest on a common basis,
1587.28 and the impact that those have
1589.28 on brain function and body function.
1593.55 I'd particularly like
to focus on fructose.
1595.76 Fructose, of course, is found in fruit,
1597.39 it's also found in the infamous
high fructose corn syrup,
1600.45 which we will talk about today.
1602.62 It's worth pointing out
that the concentrations
1604.41 of fructose in fruit
1606.09 is quite low compared to the
concentrations of fructose
1608.87 in high fructose corn syrup.
1610.39 High fructose corn syrup is
approximately 50% fructose,
1615.12 which turns out to be
1616.03 an enormously high percentage
of anything, really,
1621.77 especially when we cut contrast that
1623.08 to the concentrations
of fructose in fruit.
1625.61 Fruits have other types
of sugars in them as well.
1629.25 You know, the sucrose
content of most fruit
1631.17 and fruit juices is low.
1633.19 Although there are some
fruits like melons, peaches,
1635.96 pineapples, and so forth,
1637.63 that contain a little less
than 10% or so of sucrose.
1642.09 Things like mangoES can
have a lot of sucrose.
1644.55 But typically the amount of fructose,
1646.42 fructose, I think is the
proper pronunciation,
1649.24 people are always correcting me.
1650.37 Fructose is anywhere from
1% to about 10%, right?
1658.66 It's really going to vary quite a bit.
1660.45 And many of you have probably heard
1661.78 of the so-called glycemic index,
1663.34 which is basically a measure
of how fast blood sugar rises
1666.13 after eating particular foods, et cetera.
1668.44 We're going to set aside
the glycemic index for now,
1670.61 we will come back to it.
1671.97 It has some relationship
1673.45 to the concentrations
of fructose in fruit.
1675.83 But the point that I'd like to make
1677.14 is that fructose as a sugar,
1678.73 is handled very differently
in the body than is glucose.
1683.04 But I also want to emphasize that
1686.35 because the percentage of
fructose in fruit is rather low,
1689.99 especially compared to
high fructose corn syrup,
1693.23 many people have demonized fructose
1695.8 saying that fructose makes you fat,
1698.5 or that fruit makes you fat.
1700.77 If you look at the data,
that's not really the case.
1703.6 The fact of the matter is that
1704.62 the concentrations of fructose in fruit
1706.28 are so low that unless someone
is consuming a lot of fruit,
1709.46 or they're consuming a lot of fruit
1711.32 on the backdrop of a highly processed diet
1714.96 or a diet that has a lot of other stuff
1716.6 that they might not want to be ingesting,
1718.26 you can't really say that
fructose is fattening.
1720.3 I don't really think that
there's any basis for saying that
1722.86 fructose itself is bad.
1724.41 Now high fructose corn
syrup is a different issue,
1727.51 and too much consumption of
anything, fructose included,
1730.85 whether or not it comes
fruit or otherwise,
1732.58 can be a problem for
the ways that it impacts
1735.39 the neural circuits that process sugar,
1738.56 not just glucose, but fructose.
1740.32 And so we'll illustrate those
neural circuits in a bit,
1742.34 and it'll become very clear to all of you,
1744.8 regardless of whether or not
1745.71 you have a background in
biology or metabolism,
1748.01 nutrition, or otherwise,
1749.32 why ingesting very high
concentrations of fructose
1752.35 is not going to be a good thing
1753.9 for the way that your brain functions.
1756.69 One of the key distinctions
between glucose and fructose
1759.61 is that fructose most likely
1761.98 cannot directly access the brain.
1763.86 It actually needs to be converted
into glucose in the liver.
1767.58 And the way that conversion occurs
1770.01 feeds back to a set of
hormones and neural pathways
1773.41 that we talked about earlier,
1774.86 which have a lot to do with appetite.
1776.54 And to just summarize what is
now a lot of very solid data,
1782.13 fructose and specifically fructose,
1784.9 has the ability to reduce
certain hormones and peptides
1788.52 in our body whose main job
is to suppress Ghrelin.
1792.91 As you recall, Ghrelin is
a hormone that increases
1796.22 the longer it's been since we've eaten,
1798.23 and Ghrelin makes us hungry
1799.78 by stimulating particular
neurons in our hypothalamus,
1803.12 it actually makes us really want to eat.
1805.24 And in particular, really
makes us want to eat sugary
1808.17 and fatty foods.
1809.62 Fructose reduces the
activity of the hormones
1812.78 that reduce Ghrelin .
1814.6 And so the net consequence of that
1816.34 is that fructose increases Ghrelin.
1819.75 So, although I and I think
pretty much everyone out there,
1824.34 say for a few individuals,
1826.3 agrees that calories in and calories out
1828.37 is the fundamental
principle of weight loss,
1830.32 weight maintenance or weight gain.
1832.15 Ingesting fructose shifts
our hormone system,
1836.19 and as a consequence, our neural
pathways within our brain,
1839.9 the hypothalamus,
1841.27 to be hungrier regardless of
how many calories we've eaten.
1847.54 Now I also want to be absolutely clear,
1850.25 this does not mean that eating
an apple or eating a melon
1853.37 or eating a couple of
apricots or something
1855.69 is going to make you hyperphagic,
1858.97 meaning it's going to
make you just want to
1860.2 eat, eat, and eat, that's
simply not the case.
1862.28 But if you compare fructose
and you compare glucose,
1865.88 not only are they metabolized differently
1867.91 in the brain and body,
but in addition to that,
1870.93 fructose has this impact
of reducing the hormones
1874.64 that reduce hunger hormones
in neural circuits.
1877.99 And so fructose does
have this kind of twist
1880.74 in its phenotype, right?
1883.62 Or I guess if fructose
had a dating profile,
1887.05 this would be a kind of a
red flag in that profile,
1891.27 because fructose itself,
1893.73 while it's actually a pretty
good fuel source in many ways,
1898.09 and it's often packaged
in things like fruits,
1900.2 which bring along fiber
and vitamins and minerals,
1902.5 that I think for many of us are things
1905.04 that we should be eating more
of and ingesting more of,
1907.32 it can suppress the pathways
that suppress hunger.
1911.05 And as a consequence,
it can increase hunger.
1913.77 So current recommendations for most people
1917.0 are to eat more fruits and vegetables.
1918.78 But for those of you that are
trying to control your hunger,
1922.23 ingesting a lot of fruit to
is probably not going to be
1925.613 a good idea.
1926.446 Certainly, ingesting it from
high fructose corn syrup
1928.85 is not going to be a good idea
1929.81 because of the enormous
percentages of fructose
1932.62 in high fructose corn syrup,
50%, or sometimes even more.
1935.73 But even from fruit,
1937.22 some people will find that fruit
1938.57 really quenches their appetite.
1939.89 Other people will find that
fruit stimulates their appetite.
1942.487 And I suppose if you're trying
to stimulate your appetite,
1944.7 then ingesting more fruit
might actually be advantageous
1947.82 to you.
1948.653 So fructose provides a bridge for us
1951.38 between a particular kind
of sugar, hormone function,
1956.71 in this case Ghrelin and the hypothalamus.
1959.61 which leads us to the next question,
1961.05 which is what is it about sugar
1963.83 that makes it such an
attractive thing for us?
1966.07 Why do we like it so much?
1967.84 And the obvious answer that
most people arrive at is,
1971.01 well, it just tastes really, really good.
1973.58 But that's actually not the way it works.
1976.85 The rewarding property
is as we say of sugar,
1980.74 whether or not they come in
the form of sucrose or fructose
1983.89 or foods that increase
glucose to a very high level,
1988.71 actually is not just related
to the taste of the foods
1993.05 that produce that elevation
1994.11 in glucose, sucrose, or fructose.
1996.12 It is in part, but that's
only part of the story,
1999.35 and the rest of the story,
once you understand it,
2002.38 can actually place you in a
position to much better control
2005.84 your sugar intake of all kinds,
2008.42 but also your food intake
in ways that can allow you
2010.65 to make much better choices
about the foods you ingest.
2013.4 And actually at this point,
2014.45 I should probably give a confession,
2016.77 I've said today, and I'll say it again,
2018.84 and I've said it I'm pretty podcast.
2020.27 I don't have much of a sweet
tooth and indeed that's true.
2022.51 And I can kind of pass
on chocolate or ice cream
2025.46 or things like that,
2026.293 it seems like with each successive year,
2028.1 sweet things are less
and less appealing to me.
2030.84 Of course, savory foods,
anything that is really fatty,
2036.13 salty, savory, those don't
last long in my presence,
2039.74 but I always say, I don't really
like sweet things so much,
2042.75 and I like sweet people,
2044.21 but I don't tend to like
sweet foods, which is true.
2047.3 But there's probably one
exception and that's mangoes.
2050.48 And it turns out that mangoes
2052.23 have the highest percentage
of sugar in them,
2054.68 in particular fructose, as
well as other forms of sugars.
2058.61 So what I do, because
I love mango so much,
2062.64 is I will have mangoes
probably twice a week,
2065.43 but I'll have them after some
sort of resistance training
2068.66 or hard run or something like that.
2070.44 Because it is the case that
after you exercise hard,
2073.29 in particular exercise that is
2074.96 of the high intensity variety,
2077.02 that your body is more efficient
at using circulating sugar.
2081.78 It's able to store that
or use that for fuel.
2084.82 And so what I'll typically
do is just take the mango,
2087.67 I actually eat the peels too.
2089.02 I know there probably some
people are going to cringe
2090.5 when they hear that,
I find them delicious.
2092.01 So I'll just bite into
those things like apples,
2093.56 I don't eat the pits, however.
2095.37 So now I want to take us on a journey
2097.37 into the nervous system to explain,
2099.48 the pathways in the brain and body
2101.52 that regulate our appetite for sugar.
2104.49 Now, keep in mind what I
already told you before,
2107.04 which is that when we ingest foods,
2108.63 they're broken down
into various components
2111.46 and glucose is going to
be shuttled to the brain,
2114.06 and of course, to other
neurons in our spinal cord
2116.08 and elsewhere, and to our muscles, cetera,
2118.75 in order for all of those
cells and organs and tissues
2122.23 is to be able to function.
2125.14 The fact that so many cells
and organs and tissues
2128.02 require glucose in order to function
2130.45 has led to a situation where you have
2133.42 dedicated neural machinery,
pieces of your brain,
2136.5 that are almost entirely,
if not entirely devoted,
2139.89 to seeking out of sugar or
foods that contain sugars.
2144.74 And to make sure that you
not only seek those out,
2148.32 but you know where those foods are
2150.12 and that you ingest more
and more and more of them.
2153.53 And there are two main ways
that these neural circuits work.
2155.94 In fact, we can see that
there are two neural circuits
2157.97 entirely that work in parallel.
2160.13 And this is a common theme
throughout the nervous system,
2164.37 and that's parallel pathways.
2166.15 Parallel pathways are the
ways that you can distinguish
2168.64 light from dark,
2169.78 parallel pathways are
the ways that you can
2171.32 distinguish high pitched
sounds from low pitched sounds,
2173.65 parallel pathways are the ways
2175.07 that you can flex your muscles
versus extend your muscles.
2178.25 For instance,
2179.083 if you move your wrist
closer to your shoulder,
2180.46 you're flexing your bicep and
you're actually inhibiting,
2183.68 you're actually preventing
the action of your tricep.
2185.37 If you move your wrist
away from your shoulder,
2188.6 you are essentially using
your extensor, your tricep,
2191.53 and you're inhibiting the
activity of your bicep.
2193.78 So for every function in your body
2195.97 that you might think is
controlled by one brain area
2198.45 or one neural circuit,
2199.95 almost always there are
two or more so called
2202.69 parallel pathways that ensure
2204.67 that that particular behavior happens.
2207.96 Now, in the case of sugar consumption,
2211.06 the two parallel pathways
involve one pathway
2214.15 related to the actual taste
and the perception of taste
2219.05 that lead, not just you,
2221.31 but every animal that we're aware of,
2223.61 to seek more sweet containing foods.
2228.09 The other parallel pathway
2230.0 is related to the nutritive
component of sweet foods.
2234.84 Meaning the degree to which a given food
2237.64 will raise blood glucose.
2239.55 I want to repeat that.
2240.56 One pathway in your brain
and body is devoted to
2243.9 getting you to seek out
sweet tasting things
2246.51 that you perceive as sweet,
2248.36 and another parallel pathway is devoted
2251.65 to getting you to seek out foods
2253.89 that lead to increases in blood glucose.
2257.2 It just so happens that the foods
2258.99 that lead to big
increases in blood glucose
2261.68 typically are associated
with that sweet taste.
2264.9 Now, this is distinctly different
2266.62 than the neural pathways
that control seeking
2268.98 of savory foods or salty
foods or spicy foods,
2273.25 for that matter, or bitter foods.
2275.23 The sweet pathway is what
we would call hardwired.
2278.84 It exists, as far as we
know, in every mammal,
2281.0 it even exists in fruit
flies, hence fruit fly.
2284.07 Basically getting sweet
stuff into the body
2287.26 might seem like it has a
lot to do with the taste,
2289.44 but it has just as much to do
with the nutritive components
2293.91 that sweet tasting foods carry,
2295.99 and the fact that your nervous system
2297.89 and so many cells in your
brain and body run on glucose.
2302.22 If you recall earlier, I said,
even if you ingest fructose,
2305.57 fructose can be converted
into glucose in the liver.
2309.83 And I mentioned, of course,
2310.8 that fructose may actually
work directly on the brain,
2312.73 that's still unclear for humans,
2314.51 the jury's still out on that, we will see.
2316.92 But the fundamental
thing to understand here
2319.96 is that when you think you
want a piece of chocolate
2322.48 or you think you want a piece of cake
2324.16 or you're craving something sweet,
2326.83 you are both craving the taste
2328.65 and your neurons are literally craving
2331.73 the nutritive components
that arrive with that taste.
2335.47 And simply by understanding that
2337.19 can allow you to circumvent
some of the sugar cravings
2340.97 that you might otherwise be a
complete hopeless victim to.
2345.53 Also in this episode,
I will talk about ways
2347.61 that you can sort of undermine
2349.4 or short circuit these
circuits, if you will,
2351.6 in order to reduce sugar
cravings on a regular basis,
2354.68 if that's your goal.
2356.38 Two parallel pathways,
2358.08 one of the parallel pathways
2359.32 has to do with conscious perception.
2361.11 So animals of all kinds
of mice, rats and humans,
2364.56 will prefer sugary taste
to non-sugary taste.
2370.33 When we eat something that tastes sweet,
2373.25 we register that sweet taste
by way of sweet receptors,
2377.89 literally little ports
or portals of neurons
2381.91 on our tongue and on our pallet,
2384.18 a lot of people don't realize this,
2385.18 but there are a lot of taste
receptors on the soft pallet
2388.31 and around the mouth, on
the sides of the mouth.
2390.71 So you're actually tasting things,
2391.96 not just with your tongue,
but with your entire mouth
2393.92 and your pallet.
2394.86 So when you ingest something sweet,
2397.36 very quickly there are signals
sent from those neurons
2399.84 in your mouth to brain areas
that cause you to seek out
2404.31 or at least pay attention to,
2405.98 the source and the abundance
of those sweet things.
2408.81 They literally change your perception.
2411.45 In fact, there are beautiful
neuroimaging studies
2413.98 that show that when people
ingest a sugary drink,
2418.01 their perception of images
of foods change very much
2422.26 to make those foods
appear more appetizing,
2424.81 and not just foods that contain sugar.
2428.35 Results of those studies do show
2430.06 that there's an increase for instance,
2431.44 in the perception of detail
and images of ice cream,
2435.44 after you ingest a sweet drink
2436.98 or even if you put like a
hard candy into your mouth,
2440.21 it will make you seek
out sugary things more,
2442.26 it will make sugary things
look more appetizing,
2444.19 but also other foods, more appetizing.
2446.94 So I think it's important that
people recognize that fact,
2449.06 that when you have a
sweet taste in your mouth
2451.73 or when you've tasted something
sweet within your mouth,
2454.91 I should say, your perception
of has immediately shifted.
2459.75 These are fast neural pathways.
2461.58 We'll get into some of the
brain structures in a moment,
2463.79 but these are fast neural pathways
2465.51 that shift your entire self
toward seeking more sugary stuff
2470.98 and more food generally.
2472.77 Now, does that mean that
you should never ingest
2474.83 anything sweet?
2475.88 No, certainly I'm not saying that,
2478.69 everyone has to decide for themselves
2480.08 what the appropriate
amount of sugar intake is,
2482.15 but I find it remarkable when people say,
2484.93 oh, you know, I need to get my sugar fix,
2486.93 or I need to have my chocolate,
2488.7 or I need to have a
little bit of something
2489.96 to just kind of take care
of that sugar appetite.
2492.66 Because in taking care
of that sugar appetite,
2495.29 maybe for the very disciplined of you,
2496.74 you can just have that
one piece of chocolate
2498.047 and it's great, and you can relish in it,
2500.17 but it does shift the
way that you perceive
2503.38 other foods as well.
2504.55 And the way it does that is through our,
2507.46 probably if you're listener
this podcast, now old friend,
2510.52 but incredible neuro modulator, dopamine.
2513.91 Dopamine is a molecule
that is released from
2516.08 several places in the brain.
2517.79 There's a so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway,
2520.04 which is a whole set of places
in the brain or circuits,
2522.53 designed to get us motivated and craving
2525.23 and in pursuit of things.
2526.84 And then of course there
are areas of the brain
2528.64 that are involved in movement
2529.73 that are linked up with those
areas involved in motivation.
2533.65 That makes perfect sense.
2534.483 Why would you have a brain
area involved in motivation
2537.26 if you couldn't actually do
something with that motivation?
2539.1 So the way that your brain is designed
2541.0 is when there's an increase in dopamine,
2542.94 in the mesolimbic reward pathway,
2544.44 there are signals sent
to an area of the brain
2546.34 called the striatum,
2547.19 we're going to spend a
little bit of time today
2548.57 in the striatum.
2549.46 It's got a dorsal part,
meaning in an upper part
2551.6 and a ventral part,
which means a lower part.
2553.86 And the dopamine sent to those area,
2556.25 places us, excuse me,
into modes of action,
2559.5 to pursue particular things.
2563.36 Sugar or sweet tastes, I should
say, to be more specific,
2567.02 have an incredibly potent ability
2569.62 to activate dopamine release
2571.44 within the mesolimbic reward pathway.
2573.63 This has been shown over
and over and over again
2577.31 in animal models and in humans.
2580.21 This is especially true, I should mention,
2583.51 through the ingestion of sweet liquids.
2586.75 Now this becomes a very
important point to us
2588.99 a little later on when we
talk about the proliferation
2592.79 of sodas and sweet drinks,
and dare I even say,
2597.2 non-sugar or diet sodas,
2599.49 we're going to get into
that a little bit later.
2600.78 They are perhaps one of
the most third rail topics
2603.52 in nutrition.
2605.09 But when we ingest something sweet,
2608.54 the perception of that sweet taste
2610.35 increases dopamine in the
mesolimbic reward pathways,
2613.27 which then are conveyed to
pathways for motor behavior,
2616.63 and in general, place us
into modes of focused action
2619.7 toward getting more of whatever was sweet.
2622.92 Again, for those of you
that are very disciplined,
2625.06 you can probably eat that
one piece of chocolate
2627.77 and be just fine.
2629.45 But if you understand the
way that dopamine works,
2632.75 what you'll realize is that
when this dopamine pathway
2634.96 is triggered,
2636.02 it tends to create not the
sensation or the perception
2640.3 of satiety, of feeling
like something is enough,
2643.18 but rather to produce the
sensation of wanting more.
2647.37 As described in the episode that I hosted
2649.37 with my phenomenal colleague
2651.45 from Stanford School of
Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke,
2654.09 she's an expert on addiction
and dopamine pathways,
2657.96 the dopamine circuits of the brain
2660.26 have what we call a pleasure pain balance.
2663.5 And there I'm paraphrasing
what Dr. Anna Lembke has said,
2667.68 and has written about
in her beautiful book,
2669.497 "Dopamine Nation."
2670.33 If you haven't read that
book, I highly recommend it.
2672.39 Whether or not you have
issues with addiction
2674.74 or you know people that do, or you don't,
2677.17 it's an incredibly important read,
2679.17 especially if you're
interested in understanding
2680.82 motivated behaviors and ways
to channel your behaviors
2684.59 in life toward healthy,
motivated behaviors,
2686.91 and make sure that you avoid
some of the common pitfalls
2689.77 that people fall into, not just addiction,
2691.93 but things like overuse of social media
2695.24 or wasting time in general,
it's a phenomenal book.
2700.16 In that book, and of course,
within research articles,
2704.21 you will find evidence of this so-called
2706.69 pleasure pain balance that exists
2710.19 within our dopamine circuits.
2711.43 Nobody has dopamine
circuits that allow them
2713.86 to escape this pleasure pain balance.
2715.407 And the way this works is that anytime
2717.43 that we engage in a behavior
or we ingest something
2721.06 that increases our levels of dopamine,
2724.4 there is a subsequent increase
in the neural circuits
2727.81 that control our sense of
frustration, pain, and lack.
2732.79 You can actually notice this phenomenon
2735.83 if, for instance,
2736.77 you're somebody who
really likes chocolate,
2739.48 or you really like something else,
2741.5 pay attention to the
way that you experience
2744.51 indulging in that thing.
2747.24 If you eat that piece of chocolate
2749.28 and you really focus on
savoring its amazing taste,
2752.44 you'll notice that it provides
some quenching of your desire
2757.71 for let's say sweet stuff
or chocolate or both,
2761.58 but right as you stop experiencing that,
2765.24 right as that chocolate intake tapers off,
2768.45 as you swallow it down your throat,
2769.94 or you just pause for a second afterwards,
2772.75 what you'll notice is
that your brain and body
2775.58 actually orient toward wanting more.
2779.02 And that wanting of more
is really the action
2782.34 of the neural circuits that underlie pain
2784.36 and are pushing your
dopamine levels back down.
2787.92 And when these circuits
go awry or I should say,
2790.96 when people fail to who control themselves
2794.97 within the context of that
pleasure pain balance,
2797.51 the typical behavior is to
reach for yet another chocolate
2800.38 or to then look for something
that will quench that desire
2804.7 and get dopamine levels back up.
2806.44 Now the way these pleasure
pain circuits work
2809.17 is very diabolical.
2810.47 Because it turns out that were you to take
2811.89 another piece of chocolate,
2812.78 yes, your dopamine
levels would go back up,
2814.77 but not to the same extent that they did
2817.87 the first bite of chocolate that you had.
2820.7 In fact, we can say that
the longer it's been
2822.85 since you've indulged in
something that you really enjoy
2826.2 or would like,
2828.09 the greater the dopamine
you will experience
2830.89 when you finally engage in that behavior
2833.54 or indulge to that
thing, ingest that thing,
2836.21 and the greater the dopamine increase,
2839.03 the greater the subsequent
action of those pain circuits.
2842.45 So this puts you on a
very complicated seesaw.
2845.68 It's a very wobbly
precarious state to be in.
2848.59 Which is not to say you shouldn't
have a piece of chocolate,
2850.43 it's just to say that the
sweet taste of sweet things
2855.33 in particular, things
that we crave very much
2857.27 and we wait and wait and wait,
2858.3 and then we allow ourselves to indulge.
2861.37 Those trigger changes
in our neurochemistry,
2863.59 in our neuro circuits,
2864.51 that place us in a very vulnerable place,
2867.72 to either want more and more of that thing
2870.22 or to seek out other ways to
fill that kind of emptiness
2875.33 that we feel or that gap,
2876.84 like, oh, I would love more,
2877.86 but I'm not going to allow myself more.
2879.63 Now again, I'm not saying
that you shouldn't pursue
2882.3 pleasurable things.
2883.133 I mean this molecule
dopamine exists for a reason.
2886.16 Frankly, because of its involvement
in sex and reproduction,
2889.29 it's the reason we're all
here in the first place.
2891.05 Because last time I checked,
2892.15 the only way any of us got
here was one way or another,
2895.68 sperm met egg and there was conception.
2898.14 I still believe there are
no exceptions to that,
2900.524 that I'm aware of anyways,
2903.28 that is a process, or I should say,
2905.02 the events leading up to that process
2906.57 typically involve dopamine
in one way or another.
2908.57 There are exceptions to that
too, but you get the idea.
2911.18 These dopamine pathways are
not evil, they're not bad,
2913.86 but once you understand the way they work,
2916.45 you can leverage them to your advantage
2919.23 as opposed to them leveraging
you to their advantage.
2922.41 So when you ingest something sweet,
2925.02 you perceive that sweet
taste and a cascade ensues
2928.37 within your brain that makes you want more
2930.51 of the sweet thing.
2931.82 That's the conscious pathway
for sugar perception,
2937.31 for sweet perception.
2939.59 Now there's the second pathway,
2941.19 the second pathway is what's called
2942.68 the post-ingestive reinforcing
properties of sugar,
2946.3 which is really just a fancy
nerd speak way of saying
2949.37 there are events that
happen within your stomach
2951.89 and below your conscious detection,
2954.17 that are also driving you to
seek out sweet tasting things,
2958.02 independent of their taste,
2960.12 and foods that increase blood glucose,
2963.24 independent of their taste.
2964.93 In order to illustrate the immense power
2966.61 of these subconscious
circuits for sugar seeking,
2969.57 I'd like to describe an experiment.
2971.16 And this is just one experiment of many,
2973.46 of dozens or more experiments
done in animal models
2976.09 and humans, which essentially
illustrate the same thing.
2978.17 And as I describe this experiment,
2979.81 I think you will come to understand
2982.03 the power of these circuits.
2983.66 I'll provide a link to
this study in the caption.
2988.04 The first author is Freeman.
2989.87 The paper was published in
Frontiers in Bioscience,
2991.87 but there have been others,
2994.0 papers in Nature Neuroscience,
papers in Neuron,
2996.23 Cell Press journals, et cetera,
2997.32 many, many journals, many, many papers.
3000.72 If subjects are given the
choice of drinking plain water
3004.48 or a sweet tasting fluid,
3006.95 their preference for
the sweet tasting fluid
3009.03 is much, much higher, right?
3011.58 Sweet tastes better than plain water,
3014.08 at least for most people
and certainly for animals.
3018.57 Now, if, for instance,
3021.41 you take an animal which
completely lacks sweet receptors,
3025.38 and you can do this through
some molecular genetic tools
3028.75 and gymnastics in the laboratory,
3030.95 we call these knockout mice,
3032.12 where you can knock out
a particular receptor
3033.68 for sweet taste,
3034.513 you can confirm that there's
no perception of sweet things
3037.37 or at least no preference for sweet things
3039.81 in those animals.
3040.643 In humans, you can numb the mouth,
3041.84 there are other pharmacologic ways
3044.13 that you can eliminate sweet
receptors in the mouth.
3047.58 And by doing that, you
people will tell you,
3050.02 no, I can't taste anything sweet.
3052.31 You could give them a ice cream,
3054.05 you could give them pure sucrose,
3055.37 you could give them table sugar,
3056.64 and they wouldn't be able
to perceive it as sweet.
3059.02 If you eliminate the perception
of sweet taste in the mouth
3061.32 and you offer people
or laboratory animals,
3065.33 water versus some sugar
containing solution,
3067.97 you eliminate the preference
for the sugary solution.
3072.44 Which tells us that
the perception of sweet
3074.52 is important for the preference
for sweet tasting drink.
3079.43 This is also true for sweet
tasting foods, I should mention.
3083.18 However, in both animal
models and in humans,
3087.05 after about 15 minutes,
3090.71 subjects start preferring
the sugary water,
3094.19 even though they can't
taste that it is sweeter.
3097.66 So to repeat that,
3099.13 if you eliminate the
ability to sense sweet,
3101.75 to perceive sweetness in foods,
3104.4 then you eliminate the preference
3105.98 for sweet beverages or sweet foods.
3108.54 So that's not surprising.
3109.51 But if you wait about 15 minutes,
3111.48 the preference for the sweet beverage
3114.68 or the sweet food comes back.
3116.31 Now that doesn't mean that they
can perceive the sweetness.
3119.15 In fact, the way these experiments
are done is very clever.
3121.96 You offer people various
cups of different things
3124.97 or different food items.
3126.03 And then you just look
at what they eat more of
3127.68 or what they prefer to eat more of.
3129.13 So this experiment is so crucial
3131.71 because what it says
is that the preference
3134.48 for sugar containing foods is in part
3137.99 due to the sweetness of those foods,
3140.0 but in part due to something else.
3142.47 And this something else is what we call
3144.05 the post-ingestive effect,
and as I mentioned before,
3146.89 it took about 15 minutes.
3148.2 And you've actually experienced this,
3150.84 whether you realize it or not,
3152.26 this phenomenon of post-ingestive
rewarding properties
3155.45 of sweet foods,
3157.03 meaning what happens in your body
3159.19 when you ingest something that increases
3160.74 your blood glucose very much,
3162.48 has no doubt controlled
you from the inside,
3166.61 below your awareness,
3168.26 this was happening to you
and you didn't realize it.
3172.22 And here's how it works.
3173.33 We all have neurons within our gut.
3175.9 These neurons have a name,
they're called neuropod cells.
3178.96 Neuropod cells were famously discovered
3181.22 by Professor, Dr. Diego
Bohorquez at Duke University.
3186.0 And these cells respond
to, among other things,
3189.91 to the presence of sugar within the gut.
3192.8 So when we ingest a sugary food or drink,
3196.17 or we ingest a food or
drink that simply contains
3199.59 fructose, sucrose, glucose,
3201.27 or some other form of sugar
that later, through metabolism,
3206.42 will be converted into glucose,
3209.18 the neuropod cells are able to register
3212.0 the presence of those sweet
or glucose stimulating foods.
3217.25 And in response to that,
send electrical signals,
3221.25 because electrical signals are
the way neurons communicate,
3223.57 up to the brain, via the
so-called vagus nerve.
3226.56 The vagus nerve, of course,
being a nerve pathway,
3228.72 famous for its role in relaxation.
3230.67 That's kind of the assumption out there,
3233.08 that it's always involved in relaxation,
3234.44 that's not the case.
3235.35 It's involved in a lot of
things besides relaxation.
3237.83 But nonetheless,
3238.74 these neuropod cells
send electrical signals
3242.14 through a particular
highway within the vagus
3245.1 to the so-called nodose
ganglion, and this is a cluster,
3247.78 a ganglion is just a cluster of neurons.
3249.91 And then the nodose ganglion
sends on information
3252.9 to the nucleus of the solitary tract.
3256.09 The nucleus of the solitary
tract is an area of the brain
3258.47 that we're going to talk
about extensively today.
3260.66 It's very important for
understanding sugar preference.
3265.61 These neuropod cells
also trigger activation
3268.89 of dopamine pathways within
the mesolimbic reward pathway.
3273.32 In other words, there are
signals conveyed from the gut,
3276.91 meaning stomach and
intestines, to the brain
3279.8 anytime we ingest sweet foods,
3282.73 but it has nothing to
do with our perception
3285.24 of them being sweet, it has
everything to do with the fact
3287.67 that sweetness of food is
almost always correlated
3290.73 with an ability to increase blood glucose.
3294.24 And the net effect of
this is a parallel pathway
3298.16 by which dopamine is increased further.
3301.24 Now, the experiment
that I described before
3304.34 of animals or humans ingesting something
3307.54 that contains sugar,
3308.71 but not being able to
perceive its sweetness,
3310.93 and yet, after a period of time,
3314.1 still preferring that food or drink
3316.6 to non-sugar containing food or drinks,
3319.32 even though they can't
distinguish their taste,
3321.77 is dependent on these neuropod
cells and related pathways.
3326.6 What this may for you is that anytime
3328.98 you eat something sweet,
3331.73 that substance is
actually causing your gut,
3335.08 your stomach and your intestine,
or to be more precise,
3338.48 I should say, that
substance, food substance,
3341.44 is causing the neuropod cells
in your stomach and intestines
3345.22 to send a parallel set of
signals up to your brain saying,
3348.89 eat more of that, or simply
eat more, eat more, eat more,
3352.34 and preferably eat more sweet foods.
3354.57 So we've all heard of hidden sugars,
3356.86 meaning the sugars that
manufacturers have put into foods
3359.71 and disguised them with other flavors.
3361.62 I talked about this in
the episode on salt,
3363.7 using salt to mask the taste of sweetness
3366.06 so that people ingest more sugar.
3368.28 That is not an accident
3369.84 that hidden sugars are
often hidden with salt
3372.64 or with other flavors.
3374.55 It's done so that people
will, meaning you or me,
3377.97 will want to ingest more
of a particular food,
3381.93 independent of how sweet that food tastes.
3384.8 And in fact, some crackers, for instance,
3387.08 chips for instance, you might
think, oh, well, you know,
3389.65 chips, they're not sweet,
they're salty and savory.
3392.76 And again, I'll mention, I
love salty and savory foods,
3396.12 including certain foods, I love
kettle chips, for instance,
3398.5 I try not to walk by them
in the grocery store.
3401.33 I usually have to eat one
bag while I'm in the store,
3403.23 and then another later.
3404.59 The savory foods are often
laden with these hidden sugars
3410.01 that we can't register as sweetness,
3411.95 but trigger the neuropod cells,
3413.4 which then further trigger dopamine,
3414.85 which make us want more of them.
3416.69 Now we may be able to
resist eating more of them,
3419.35 but it makes us crave
more food in general.
3423.61 Now we will talk about ways
to regulate this pathway,
3427.37 to sort of intervene in
this subconscious pathway.
3430.75 But for now I'm hoping
that just the understanding
3434.52 that we all have this pathway,
3435.83 this is hardwired into our body,
3439.63 could potentially allow
people to better understand
3441.88 why is it that their
cravings are so intense,
3445.46 that it's not necessarily just
about the taste of that food.
3448.48 And when you consider this
in concert with the fact
3453.09 that we have this dopamine pain
pleasure balance, excuse me,
3456.53 that I referred to earlier,
3458.22 you start to realize that
there are multiple mechanisms
3460.45 hardwired into us, that make
it especially hard to not eat
3464.59 the sweet thing or to not eat
the food that we're craving.
3467.47 And indeed, that's the case.
3468.81 We have two major accelerators.
3470.72 It's like a car with two accelerators,
3472.99 and we will talk about the brakes,
3474.83 but two ways that really
get us into forward motion
3478.06 toward pursuing the
consumption of sweet foods.
3481.13 Now, if it doesn't already
seem diabolical enough,
3483.33 that sweet things that
we perceive as sweet,
3485.93 make us want to eat more of those
3487.04 because of dopamine and then send us down
3488.91 this pain pleasure pathway
that I mentioned earlier,
3493.03 and the fact that we have
this subconscious circuit
3496.0 coming from the neuropod cells in our gut
3498.14 that are registering the presence of sugar
3500.71 or glucose increasing foods in our gut
3502.73 and sending those signals to
the brain for yet more dopamine
3504.917 and pain pleasure challenges,
3507.69 there's a third layer to this whole thing.
3510.11 And that has to do with how sugar
3512.24 is metabolized in the brain.
3513.71 Or I should say how glucose is used.
3515.83 Without getting into too much detail,
3518.3 some of the more beautiful
studies of neuroimaging
3521.67 and evaluating which
brain areas are active
3525.09 when we eat certain foods
3526.34 were done by Dr. Dana Small's
lab at Yale University,
3529.83 and in some of her previous
work when she was elsewhere,
3533.14 and of course by other laboratories too.
3535.17 And they used an approach called
3536.72 positron emission tomography,
3538.67 and they and others have used
PET scanning as it's called,
3542.96 positron mission tomography,
3545.54 along with an tool
called 2-Deoxy-D-glucose.
3548.48 2-Deoxy-D-glucose is actually
involved in the procedure
3551.52 of seeing which brain areas are active
3553.49 when people eat foods or engage
in other types of behaviors.
3556.52 But the way that 2-Deoxy-D-glucose,
3559.33 sometimes shortened 2DG.
3561.33 The way that it works is
to block glucose uptake
3565.55 from neurons.
3566.93 And instead, bring along with it,
3569.7 a marker that one can see through imaging.
3572.43 So in other words,
3573.78 a tool for looking at what
parts of the brain are active
3577.2 when eating particular foods,
3579.12 actually prevents foods such as sugar,
3582.6 from allowing glucose to
get into particular neurons.
3586.95 Now that might seem like a bad situation,
3589.01 you'd say, well, wait,
3589.843 you're trying to understand
how sugar works in the brain,
3592.53 and then you block the
ability for sugar, glucose,
3596.44 to bind to, or be used by these neurons,
3599.75 because of the thing that
you're using for the experiment.
3601.54 Exactly, it's a huge problem,
3603.41 but it turns out to be a huge problem
3604.67 that led to a great insight.
3606.11 And the great insight is this,
3608.5 the preference for sweet
tasting foods and liquids
3611.97 is actually blocked by 2-Deoxy-D-glucose.
3617.52 What that means, experimentally,
3619.28 but also in terms of what
it means for you and me
3621.55 in the real world, is that there's yet
3623.89 a third parallel pathway
3626.98 that's related to the use of blood sugar,
3630.99 the use of glucose by neurons,
3634.1 that further reinforces our
desire to eat more sweet things.
3638.81 And the preference for sweet foods
3640.9 can actually be eliminated
through 2-Deoxy-D-glucose.
3645.43 Now I am definitely don't
want people going out
3648.42 and consuming 2-Deoxy-D-glucose.
3649.84 This is a laboratory tool,
3651.07 it is not something that
you should be ingesting.
3654.05 So don't go look it up
and try and get some,
3656.15 there might be other uses for
it, but that's not the point.
3658.19 The point is that it is the
sweet taste of sugary foods.
3663.21 It is the signals coming from your gut,
3666.87 from your digestive tract to your brain,
3669.47 and it's the use of the
metabolic consequences
3673.89 of sugary foods that are
acting as a three pronged push
3678.62 on your desire to consume
more sugary foods.
3681.84 So this car analogy that I used before,
3684.78 where it's some weird car
that has two accelerators,
3687.06 it actually has three accelerators.
3689.38 And so with three accelerators,
all pushing the system hard,
3693.75 we can say, wow,
3694.82 there must be something really
special about this pathway.
3697.57 And indeed there is,
3698.7 this pathway is the quickest
source of fuel for the brain
3701.7 and the rest of the nervous system,
3702.75 it's the source of fuel for
the brain and nervous system.
3705.95 And I realize, as I say
that all the ketonistas
3708.63 are probably going no,
3709.54 actually ketones are the preferred source.
3711.37 Okay, i acknowledge that
there are conditions
3713.95 under which you can bring
your blood glucose very low,
3716.13 and there are reasons to do that.
3717.32 Actually ketosis has been a
3719.41 terrifically successful treatment
3721.28 for a lot of forms of epilepsy,
3722.72 in particular, pediatric epilepsy.
3726.19 Many people do derive
benefit from ketogenic diets,
3728.56 so I'm not knocking ketogenic diets,
3730.69 but if you were to look at
what neurons normally prefer,
3734.54 meaning in a typical diet
regimen, it would be glucose.
3739.95 And the fact that fructose
3742.26 is eventually converted to glucose,
3743.97 the fact that when we ingest sucrose,
3745.74 it's eventually converted into
a fuel that neurons can use,
3747.88 that's very much in the glucose pathway,
3750.07 what you basically arrive at is the fact
3752.0 that your nervous system is
a glucose consuming machine.
3755.0 And you've got at least three pathways,
3757.12 of which I've described,
3758.57 that are pushing on your brain consciously
3761.15 and subconsciously to get
you to seek and consume
3764.06 more sugar.
3765.19 Now that all sounds like a
pretty depressing picture,
3768.08 at least for those of you
that are trying to reduce
3769.56 your sugar intake.
3770.393 And of course we can
all reduce sugar intake
3773.11 by way of sheer will,
3774.43 we can not have those foods at home,
3776.48 we can restrict ourselves from those.
3778.4 But there are some things that we all can
3781.33 and perhaps should do in order
to regulate these pathways
3785.02 such that we don't feel
so controlled by them,
3788.41 but rather that we control their output.
3791.36 And of course they are us and we are them,
3792.96 so this gets into all sorts
of issues of consciousness
3795.61 and freewill that I
certainly don't want to cover
3797.59 in this episode.
3798.9 But nonetheless, I think
once you understand
3802.77 that these circuits exist
3804.61 and you understand that there
are simple substitutions
3808.13 and modifications that one
can make to their food intake
3811.57 that can work within these pathways
3814.82 and even bypass some of these pathways,
3817.17 you start to realize that
you have a lot more control
3819.42 over sugar intake and sugar appetite
3822.503 than you previously thought.
3824.16 Now, many of you have heard of
the so-called glycemic index.
3826.57 The glycemic index is a measure of
3828.44 how quickly blood sugar rises
3830.0 after ingesting particular foods.
3831.97 And very broadly speaking,
3833.98 we can say that there are
low glycemic index foods,
3836.98 of less than 55, typically,
is the measurement,
3840.08 or medium glycemic index foods,
3841.94 which go from about 55 to 69,
3844.02 and then so called high glycemic
foods, which are above 70.
3846.89 And of course there's additional nuance
3848.92 related to glycemic load
3850.93 and many more features
of the glycemic index.
3854.98 A couple of things to understand
3856.22 about how the glycemic index is measured.
3858.77 And then I'd like to
just briefly talk about
3861.05 how the glycemic index can
be leveraged to short circuit
3865.55 some of the neural circuits
that would otherwise lead us
3868.73 to crave and perhaps
even ingest sugar foods.
3873.12 First of all, measurements
of glycemic indices of food
3877.76 are typically made by having
people ingest those foods
3880.51 in isolation.
3881.8 And in general, we can say
that anytime we ingest fiber
3886.45 and/or fat, lipids, along
with a particular food,
3889.87 it will reduce the glycemic
index of that particular food,
3893.87 either the absolute level of blood glucose
3897.39 that a particular food causes
3900.16 or the rate at which that
elevation in blood glucose occurs.
3905.09 And this is why there are some
seemingly paradoxical aspects
3909.28 to sweet stuff in terms
of the glycemic index.
3911.45 For instance, Ice cream
has a lower glycemic index,
3914.52 provided its ice cream that includes fat,
3916.48 which I hope it would,
3917.313 'cause that's the good tasting ice cream,
3918.38 in my opinion,
3919.43 compared to something like
mangoes or table sugar, right?
3923.15 So the glycemic index is
not something to hold holy,
3927.21 in most cases,
3928.1 because most people are not
ingesting foods in isolation.
3931.04 And there's actually a lot of argument
3932.52 as to whether or not the glycemic index
3933.96 is really as vital as some people claim.
3938.21 There's also the context
3939.41 in which you ingest particular foods.
3941.22 As I mentioned earlier,
3942.68 after I do hard training of any kind,
3945.08 meaning training that
ought to deplete glycogen,
3946.9 so hard resistance training,
3948.09 I actually make it a point to ingest
3950.16 some very sweet high
glycemic foods like a mango,
3953.3 I'll also ingest some starches
3954.73 'cause I'm trying to replenish glycogen.
3956.12 I'm also trying to spike
my blood sugar a little bit
3958.79 because that can be advantageous
3960.07 in terms of certain strength
and hypertrophy protocols,
3962.45 et cetera.
3963.283 But most of the time I'm avoiding
these high glycemic foods
3965.247 and high sugar foods, I
should point that out.
3967.59 Now, why am I telling you
about the glycemic index?
3969.71 Well, if we zoom out
and take our perspective
3973.31 on all of this discussion
about the glycemic index,
3975.68 through the lens of the nervous system,
3978.09 and we remind ourselves that neurons
3980.38 prefer glucose for energy
and that all sweet things,
3984.24 or things that we perceive as sweet,
3985.65 but also sweet things that
are ingested and registered
3988.47 by those neuropod cells in our gut
3990.54 trigger the release of dopamine
3992.45 and trigger these neural circuits
3994.39 to make us want to eat
more of these foods,
3997.01 what we start to realize
is that a sharp rise
4000.04 in blood glucose or a very
high degree of elevation
4003.86 in blood glucose,
4004.98 is going to be a much more potent signal
4007.9 than would a more moderate
rise in blood glucose
4011.63 or a slower rise in blood glucose.
4014.89 So if we think about the
analogy of three accelerators,
4018.23 meaning three parallel neural circuits,
4020.13 all essentially there
to get us to seek out
4023.27 and consume more sweet
tasting and sugary foods,
4027.26 well then the glycemic index
is sort of our measurement
4031.01 of how hard we are pushing down
4032.95 or how fast we are pushing down
on those three accelerators.
4036.5 And so for those of you that are trying to
4038.2 reduce sugar take,
4039.55 and you want to do that
through an understanding
4042.04 of how these neural circuits work,
4043.56 and you want to short circuit
some of the dopamine release
4046.62 that's caused by ingesting sugary foods.
4050.13 It can be advantageous
to ingest sweet foods,
4055.35 either alone or in combination with foods
4058.96 that reduce glycemic index
or reduce glycemic load.
4062.9 So that might mean making
different food choices.
4066.02 So paying attention to sweet tasting foods
4068.81 that can satisfy sugar cravings,
4070.84 but do not have as steep or I should say,
4073.51 do not cause as steep
a rise in blood sugar,
4076.04 or it could mean consuming other foods
4079.26 along with sweet foods
4080.88 in order to reduce the glycemic index
4083.24 and thereby, slow or blunt
the release of dopamine.
4087.36 You might think, well, why
would I want to do that?
4089.31 I want the maximum dopamine output
4091.68 in response to a given sweet food.
4093.31 I don't just want the you know, level 10.
4095.47 I want the level 100 output of dopamine.
4098.08 But you really don't,
4099.13 because of the pleasure pain
balance that dopamine causes.
4101.69 And in fact, if we consider
some of the non-food substances
4104.98 that really push hard on
these dopamine pathways,
4107.31 we can come up with a somewhat sinister,
4109.88 but nonetheless appropriate analogy.
4113.25 The drug, cocaine, causes
very robust, potent increases
4117.57 in dopamine within the brain,
4119.53 and typically causes people
to want to ingest more cocaine
4122.89 because of those sharp
increases in dopamine.
4127.28 But within the category
of the drug cocaine,
4130.14 there are various modes of ingestion.
4132.12 Some people inhale it,
4133.73 some people will inject it intravenously,
4137.52 some people will smoke it,
4138.91 and those different
forms of taking cocaine
4142.13 actually impact the dopamine
circuits differently.
4144.95 And it turns out that crack cocaine,
4147.67 the smokable form of cocaine rock,
4151.27 increases dopamine to a very high degree,
4153.93 but also very quickly.
4156.26 And it is the sharp rise
in dopamine over time,
4160.56 not so much the absolute
level of dopamine,
4163.4 that makes crack cocaine
so absolutely addictive.
4167.45 So sometimes you'll hear, you know,
4168.9 sugar is like crack,
4170.4 well, and that's getting a little extreme
4172.14 because even though I don't
think the measurements
4174.05 have been done in the same experiment,
4176.1 I think it's reasonable to think
4177.66 that the absolute level of dopamine caused
4180.85 by ingesting sugar, at
least for most people,
4182.85 is not going to be as high as
the absolute level of dopamine
4186.09 caused by smoking crack.
4188.39 Of course it goes without saying,
4189.5 please don't do cocaine
in any form, by the way.
4193.7 It is appropriate to say that
the rate of dopamine increase
4198.87 over time has a profound
effect on how people will,
4203.95 and if people will,
4205.75 go on to want to pursue
more of what caused
4208.46 that increase in dopamine.
4210.16 So what I'm basically saying
is if you're going to ingest
4213.15 sweet foods in order to
satisfy a sweet craving,
4218.4 ingesting sweet foods for which
the glycemic index is lower
4222.33 or in which you've adjusted
those glycemic index foods
4226.06 through the co-ingestion
of fiber, or maybe fat,
4230.09 might be beneficial.
4231.61 So is this justification
for putting peanut butter
4234.51 on that piece of chocolate
4235.88 or for having a of ice
cream along with the mango
4239.8 that you're craving?
4241.2 In some sense, yes, however,
4244.23 there's also the issue of
how sweet and how delicious
4247.21 something tastes.
4248.32 Highly palatable foods,
absolutely delicious foods,
4251.73 trigger that one neural circuit,
4253.91 that one accelerator that
we were talking about
4256.41 in terms of our analogy
of three accelerators,
4258.95 and the more delicious something
tastes within our mouth,
4261.85 the further increase in dopamine.
4264.66 So if you really wanted to
adjust your sugar cravings
4267.9 and you really still want
to ingest some sugary foods,
4272.62 you probably would better
off combining fiber
4275.55 with that sugary or sweet food.
4277.99 Now I do realize that
it's somewhat unusual
4279.94 and you probably get some strange stares,
4282.28 if you decided to consume broccoli,
4284.54 for instance, along with your chocolate,
4286.36 or with a another dessert
that would otherwise
4288.45 cause a steep increase in blood sugar
4291.0 and has a high glycemic index.
4292.69 But nonetheless, if your goal is to blunt
4295.92 your sugar cravings,
4297.33 what you really need to do is
blunt that dopamine increase.
4300.35 So what we're really talking about here
4302.29 is trying to reduce the dopamine signal
4305.14 that is the consequence
of ingesting sweet foods.
4307.75 And we're talking about doing that
4309.08 through these different parallel pathways,
4310.86 not just by preventing sweet taste,
4312.96 but also by preventing
the post-ingestive effects
4315.79 of sweet foods.
4317.76 And of course the backdrop to all of this
4320.66 is that most of us, again,
most of us, not all of us,
4323.3 should probably be ingesting
fewer refined sugars.
4327.66 Certainly there are exceptions to that.
4329.65 But I think the bulk of
data point to the fact
4333.07 that ingesting these highly palatable,
4335.58 certainly highly palatable,
highly processed foods,
4337.89 or foods that contain a lot
of high fructose corn syrup,
4341.35 can be really deleterious to our health,
4343.05 especially in kids.
4344.79 And I'm not going to cite
off a bunch of statistics,
4347.61 you've all heard them before,
4348.64 that you know, for hundreds of
years, we ingested, you know,
4352.84 the equivalent of a few cups
or pounds of sugar per year.
4356.32 And you know, now people are ingesting
4357.98 hundreds of pounds of sugar per year.
4360.34 The major culprit always
seems to be sugary drinks,
4363.72 meaning soft drinks, and I
think indeed that's the case.
4367.64 I do want to point out the incredible work
4369.68 of Dr. Robert Lustig,
4370.91 who's a pediatric endocrinologist
4372.84 at the University of
California San Francisco,
4374.9 who was really early in the
game of voicing the dangers
4377.895 of so-called hidden sugars
and highly processed foods,
4380.55 there are other people, of
course, now talking about this.
4383.7 His laboratory has done important
work showing for instance,
4387.21 that if high fructose corn syrup
4390.14 or even just fructose is
replaced with glucose,
4393.14 even if the same number
calories is ingested,
4396.69 that there are important
meaning significant reductions
4400.91 in type two diabetes,
4403.37 some of the metabolic syndromes
4404.66 associated with high fructose corn syrup
4406.347 and on and on and on.
4408.02 And of course there are other
culprits in type two diabetes,
4410.68 there are other factors that
are going to lead to obesity.
4413.9 But I think that work
from Lustig and others
4416.44 has really illustrated that
we should all be trying
4419.21 to reduce our intake of
highly refined sugars
4422.43 and high fructose corn syrup.
4424.28 And certainly trying to reduce our intake
4426.66 of very sugary drinks,
not just soft drinks,
4431.28 but also fruit juices that
contain a lot of sugar.
4433.95 Now, even for people that
are of healthy weight
4436.09 and who don't have metabolic syndromes,
4438.36 there may be an additional reason
4440.2 to not want to ingest very sweet foods
4443.67 and highly refined sugars.
4445.2 And this has to do with
a new and emerging area
4448.22 of nutrition neuroscience.
4451.95 And I want to point out that
these are new data, right,
4454.7 so it's not a lock,
4455.67 the double blind placebo
controlled studies
4457.61 in large populations
have not been finished.
4460.32 So I want to make sure that that's clear,
4463.42 but I also want to make clear
4465.37 what some of the really exciting data,
4467.38 coming from Dana Small's lab at Yale,
4469.75 and from other laboratories are showing.
4472.03 And this has to do with what's called
4473.92 conditioned taste preference.
4476.07 Using a kind of Pavlovian
paradigm, what they do,
4479.67 is they have people, and these
studies were done in people,
4482.79 ingest maltodextrin, which
increases blood glucose,
4485.96 doesn't have much flavor,
4487.0 but even if it does have a
little bit of subtle flavor,
4489.8 the maltodextrin is cloaked
by some other flavor.
4493.67 And by cloaking it with that other flavor
4496.33 or pairing it with that other flavor,
4497.95 what they find is that over time,
4499.88 because the maltodextrin
increases blood glucose,
4502.36 and they're ingesting a particular flavor
4504.06 along with that maltodextrin,
4506.05 they can then remove the maltodextrin,
4509.3 and the flavor will induce
an increase in insulin.
4513.85 The increase in insulin of course,
4515.35 is the consequence of
the fact that anytime
4517.59 there's a rise in blood glucose,
4518.78 provided the person isn't diabetic,
4520.42 there's a parallel increase in insulin.
4525.26 Now this is very interesting
because what it says is,
4528.47 well at a first pass, it says
that we are very Pavlovian
4531.62 in terms of our physiological
responses to foods
4534.9 and particular flavors
come to be associated
4537.66 with particular patterns
of blood glucose increase
4541.27 and hence patterns of insulin increase,
4544.294 because of course,
4545.127 insulin manages glucose in the bloodstream
4547.29 as I mentioned earlier.
4549.52 This also has implications
for understanding
4552.44 things like artificial sweeteners.
4553.9 And here I want to
highlight that this is still
4555.83 very controversial work, needs
more data, but nonetheless,
4558.93 I'd like to share it with
you for consideration.
4563.08 The small laboratory has
done studies in humans,
4566.66 both in adults and in children,
4568.66 showing that if the flavor
of artificial sweeteners
4573.07 is paired with maltodextrin,
4574.85 and then the maltodextrin is removed,
4577.45 that the artificial sweetener taste itself
4580.92 can subsequently increase
insulin in the bloodstream.
4584.47 In other words, taking something
that increases blood sugar,
4589.03 attaching a flavor experience to that,
4591.9 having children or
adults ingest that thing,
4596.15 allows the nervous system
to associate that flavor
4599.72 with that increase in blood glucose.
4601.57 But then you can remove the
glucose increasing substance,
4605.2 and the flavor alone will increase insulin
4607.63 because insulin typically
follows blood glucose.
4610.21 So this is a conditioning effect.
4612.05 Now, the reason these
data are controversial
4614.01 is several fold.
4614.843 First of all, the landscape
around the discussion
4619.15 around artificial sweeteners
is definitely what I would call
4623.16 a barbed wire topic.
4624.69 And I want to preface what I'm
about to say next by saying,
4627.05 I actually ingest artificial sweeteners.
4629.26 I will have the occasional
diet soda, not every day,
4632.32 maybe I don't know, once or twice a month.
4634.0 I don't particularly like the taste,
4635.11 but I'll do it just 'cause it's around,
4636.54 and I want some caffeine
and I like the carbonation
4638.92 if I'm on a plane or something,
4640.6 I do ingest plant-based
non-caloric sweeteners.
4644.52 To my knowledge, there have
not been high quality studies
4647.5 of plant-based non-caloric sweeteners
4649.54 in the context that I'm referring to here.
4652.49 Nonetheless, these studies
show that particular flavors
4655.5 can be conditioned to
cause an insulin increase.
4658.84 And the flavor associated with
certain artificial sweeteners
4663.81 is included in that category of flavors
4666.2 that can induce insulin,
4667.76 even in the absence of something
4669.133 that can increase blood glucose.
4670.69 Now the simple takeaway from these studies
4674.298 would be the following,
4676.59 and this is actually one
interpretation that Dana Small
4679.81 has offered to her data,
4680.92 but she offers other
interpretations as well.
4682.96 One of interpretation is that if people
4685.8 are going to ingest artificial sweeteners,
4688.49 and they do that along with foods
4690.72 that very sharply increase blood glucose,
4694.13 then there is the potential,
I highlight the potential,
4697.77 for those same artificial
sweeteners to increase insulin,
4701.94 even in the absence of food.
4704.76 In other words, let's
just draw the scenario out
4706.63 in the real world.
4708.87 You're having a diet soda
4711.81 along with a cheeseburger and fries.
4715.26 You do that every day for lunch, okay?
4717.92 Somewhat extreme example,
but natural world example,
4719.97 you do that every day for lunch.
4721.09 And then you just have a diet soda alone.
4724.57 The extreme interpretation of the data
4727.7 that they've collected says,
4729.12 well, that diet soda alone
will increase insulin,
4731.46 even though there's no
increase in blood glucose
4733.89 because you haven't ingested food with it
4735.07 because you conditioned that
taste of artificial sweetener
4738.62 to the experience of a rise
in glucose and hence insulin.
4742.24 Now the counter argument to this would be,
4744.82 well, that's a very unusual situation,
4746.84 maltodextrin causes big
increases in blood glucose,
4750.09 so that's not really a fair experiment
4752.77 or it's not a natural world experiment.
4754.34 And I think that's a decent assessment.
4756.32 Although I will point out
that one of the reasons
4759.32 why this study is so controversial
4761.81 or why these data are so controversial,
4763.45 is that the experiment
actually had to be stopped.
4766.24 And particularly the
experiment in children
4767.84 had to be stopped because
the changes in insulin
4772.31 that were observed early in
the study were so detrimental,
4776.53 that the institutional review
board, quite appropriately,
4779.77 said, we can't do this to these kids.
4781.35 They're experiencing these
odd shifts in insulin
4784.64 that are not healthy for them
4786.76 when they're just ingesting
artificial sweeteners
4788.81 in the absence of these
glucose increasing foods.
4791.86 So once again, I do ingest
artificial sweeteners,
4795.08 I'm not saying that they are dangerous,
4796.31 I'm not saying that
they are not dangerous,
4798.65 I'm saying that you have
to decide for yourself.
4800.95 In previous episodes,
4801.86 I've highlighted that
artificial sweeteners
4803.9 have been shown in studies of animals,
4807.53 that when given in very high
doses, sucralose in particular,
4811.93 there can be fairly robust
disruption to the gut microbiome,
4816.46 which is vital for immune
health and brain health,
4818.56 et cetera, et cetera.
4820.17 But thus far, our knowledge
of how artificial sweeteners
4824.07 negatively impacts or positively
impacts, I should say,
4826.81 the microbiome and other
deleterious effects on the body,
4832.58 has mainly been explored
in animal studies.
4836.13 Again, the work by Dana Small
has been done in humans.
4839.41 There's some parallel work
by others in animal models.
4842.04 I bring it up today to
illustrate the following point.
4847.56 Normally we have a pathway
4849.27 that we don't have to condition at all,
4851.01 it's there from birth,
4852.64 whereby ingestion of sweet foods
4855.14 causes increases in dopamine.
4857.66 And there are parallel pathways
by which neurons in our gut
4862.02 and elsewhere in our body,
4863.56 trigger further increases in dopamine.
4867.56 There's no need for a conditioned response
4870.27 or to become Pavlovian about this, right?
4872.64 You're hardwired to want
to eat sweet things,
4875.59 by at least two and probably
three parallel pathways.
4878.61 Now the work from Dana
Small's lab and others
4881.63 that have illustrated this
conditioned flavor preference,
4884.91 I think beautifully show that any flavor
4888.01 that's associated with a glucose spike
4890.69 or a long sustained increase in glucose
4894.37 can also be conditioned.
4895.92 In other words, the circuits for dopamine
4898.07 that reinforce the desire
to eat particular things
4900.57 is not unique to the sugar pathway.
4902.43 And this is one of the reasons I believe,
4905.48 why ingestion of sweet foods
4907.87 doesn't just us to want
to eat more sweet foods,
4910.61 I think that is absolutely clear
4912.23 based on animal data and on human data,
4914.333 I think that's robust,
4915.55 it's actually the stuff of textbooks now,
4919.09 but in addition, ingesting sweet foods
4921.09 and/or foods that raise blood glucose,
4923.98 but that we don't perceive as sweet.
4925.81 So for instance, foods with hidden sugars,
4928.32 sugars that have been masked
asked by salty or spicy taste,
4932.17 increases our desire for
glucose elevating foods
4935.037 and food, generally,
4936.95 I think that's the only
logical interpretation
4939.61 of the data that I can arrive at.
4941.63 So for people that struggle
with regulating their appetite
4943.84 or with regulating their sugar appetite,
4946.25 I think the understanding of
conditioned flavor preference,
4949.15 while a little bit complicated,
4951.21 ought to be useful in
trying to navigate reducing
4954.06 sugar cravings and sugar intake.
4955.82 As a segue into tools
to control sugar intake,
4958.41 as a means to both regulate
sugar intake itself,
4962.57 as well as food intake overall
4964.41 and steer us towards healthier choices.
4967.26 I'd like to talk about some
of the special populations
4970.45 out there that might want
to be especially wary
4972.9 of having a dysregulated
sugar appetite system.
4977.73 And the group I'm
referring to specifically
4980.06 are those with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder
4983.23 or, I should say, and/or,
4985.54 people who have issues with
focus and attention, generally.
4988.99 And I think more and more nowadays,
4990.3 I'm hearing that people are
having a hard time focusing.
4993.07 This probably has something
to do with our interactions
4996.01 with electronic devices.
4997.27 As I always say, if a picture
is worth a thousand words,
4999.64 a movie is worth a million pictures,
5002.56 and the fact that we
can access so any movies
5005.53 just by scrolling with our thumb,
5007.16 is something that the nervous system
5008.26 has just never contended
with before in human history.
5010.82 I'm confident in that.
5012.35 And it's not that it can't deal with it,
5014.29 the question is what's the trade off?
5016.36 What are the consequences of that?
5018.66 So attention and ability
to focus is obviously key
5022.66 to success in school,
success in relationships,
5025.13 success in the workplace,
and success in life.
5028.38 We could probably even go so
far as to say one's ability
5031.35 to succeed in anything is
proportional to one's ability
5034.94 to focus and then deliberately defocus
5037.32 when the time comes to defocus, right?
5038.98 'Cause we all need rest
and we need to disengage
5040.84 and then reengage,
5043.64 If you look at the sum
total of the meta-analysis
5047.92 and the clinical data
on ADHD and nutrition,
5052.13 you arrive at a pretty clear answer,
5054.19 which is that sugar consumption,
5056.21 in particular, highly refined sugars,
5058.07 is just not good for people with ADHD
5061.15 or with attentional issues.
5062.82 Now, as I say that, I
also want you to recall
5065.46 the earlier study that I referred to,
5067.17 whereby the tuning of neurons in the brain
5069.46 is highly dependent on glucose.
5071.02 So this doesn't mean consuming no glucose
5074.11 is going to be a good idea.
5075.15 It doesn't mean that the ketogenic diet
5077.6 is necessarily the best diet for ADHD.
5080.38 Although there are some
people pursuing that
5082.55 and exploring that, and we'll
do yet another episode on ADHD
5085.81 at some point that go was a
little bit deeper into that,
5087.92 because there's some new data.
5088.91 I did do a very long and fairly
extensive episode on ADHD.
5094.47 You're welcome to look that
up if you like in our archive,
5097.88 excuse me, in our archive
at hubermanlab.com,
5102.58 it's all timestamped.
5103.54 So, you know, because the
number of people said,
5105.75 oh, you know, it's an episode on ADHD
5107.267 and you made it two and a half hours long.
5108.72 Yes we did, because we wanted
it to be as comprehensive
5111.68 as we could at the time.
5113.07 But it is timestamped,
5114.26 you can just jump to the
particular topics of interest
5115.52 and there's short little cassettes there.
5118.53 Now, if you'd like to
know upon what I'm basing
5121.26 this statement that sugar consumption
5123.93 and highly refined sugar consumption
5125.83 is potentially bad for ADHD,
5128.14 I'm basing this mainly on the conclusions
5131.56 of a really nice paper,
5133.04 the title of the paper is
5134.477 "Sugar Consumption, Sugar
Sweetened Beverages,
5137.32 and Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder:
5139.36 A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."
5141.27 And this is a paper,
5143.5 we'll put a link to this in the caption.
5145.64 This was published in
Complementary Therapies in Medicine
5148.77 which is a bit of an atypical
journal in some sense.
5151.04 But I really like this meta-analysis.
5153.43 The sum total of this
meta-analysis is really that when,
5159.32 especially kids, get beyond
four sugary drinks per week,
5164.26 so four sodas of a typical 12 ounce soda,
5167.15 when they get past four
12 ounce sugary sodas,
5170.15 they didn't, as far as I know,
5171.55 look at artificially sweetened sodas.
5174.2 That's when you start
to see a shift towards
5177.52 more negative outcomes, more
symptoms of existing ADHD.
5181.98 Now where the controversy comes in
5184.08 is whether or not sugar consumption
5186.22 can actually trigger or cause ADHD.
5188.857 And I don't think we can conclude
that at all at this time.
5192.19 And this review, if you
decide to check it out,
5195.3 review/meta-analysis, I should say,
5197.3 if you decide to check it out,
5198.46 goes into some of the nuance around that.
5200.86 What's also interesting in
terms of ADHD and sugar intake,
5204.977 and it probably has
relevance to all of us,
5207.16 is that they also cover
some of the interesting data
5209.66 showing that supplementation
with omega-3 fatty acids
5214.0 can actually beneficial for people,
5217.13 in particular kids with ADHD,
5219.36 I've talked before about
the utility of omega-3s,
5222.45 that's been shown in various studies
5223.85 that have compared
omega-3 fatty acid intake
5226.48 to say prescription
antidepressants, like SSRIs,
5229.89 like Prozac, Zoloft,
and similar, Fluoxetine,
5232.79 and the results of those
studies are pretty clear,
5235.16 at least to me,
5236.07 that provided that one gets
at least one gram of EPA,
5240.63 essential fatty acids,
5241.67 so it's not just getting one gram per day,
5243.41 but one or more grams
per day of the EPA form
5247.22 of essential fatty acid,
5248.56 can rival some prescription
antidepressants
5251.77 and/or decrease the
amount of antidepressants
5255.23 that's required to take.
5256.21 Which for a lot of people
can be a very useful thing
5258.96 because of the side effect profile
5260.44 of many of those antidepressants.
5261.58 Of course, talk to your
psychiatrist, talk to your doctor,
5263.56 but the omega-3s are no doubt powerful.
5266.29 And then of course there's a whole story
5267.52 about omega-3s and heart health.
5269.52 And of course, like anything else,
5271.14 there's some controversy around omega-3s,
5272.8 but I think the data
are clear enough to me
5274.62 around mood and cardiovascular health,
5276.06 that certainly I personally ingest them.
5277.497 But as always, I always say,
5279.83 anytime you're going to
add or remove anything
5282.02 from your nutrition,
supplementation, exercise,
5284.03 or otherwise your lifestyle,
5286.33 definitely consult with a
board certified physician.
5288.29 I don't just say that to protect me,
5289.56 I say that to protect you,
5291.36 you are responsible for
your health ultimately.
5293.92 So omega-3 supplementation
has been shown to be
5297.1 beneficial for ADHD.
5298.39 Why am I talking about this in the context
5300.04 of an episode on sugar
and the nervous system?
5302.34 Well, if you remember
those neuropod cells,
5304.99 those cells in your gut
that respond to sugar
5307.16 and send signals up to the brain
5308.64 to cause the release of dopamine.
5310.41 Well, it turns out that
neuropod cells also respond to
5314.58 amino acids and to fatty acids,
5317.42 in particular, essential fatty acids.
5320.29 So these cells that we
call neuropod cells,
5323.24 have three jobs.
5325.3 One is to levels of sugar in the gut,
5327.98 the other is to detect
levels of amino acids,
5331.09 and to detect levels of
particular essential fatty acids,
5334.76 and communicate that
information to the brain.
5338.38 And I should point out
when I say communicate
5339.99 that information, they're
not actually saying,
5341.34 hey, there's amino acids here,
5342.79 or hey, there's sugar here,
5344.54 or, hey, there's essential fatty acids,
5346.13 because the language of these
cells is somewhat generic.
5349.19 It's just the firing of
electrical potentials.
5351.74 But that's the key point,
5352.8 it's generic and all three
or any of those three,
5356.6 sugar, essential fatty
acids, or amino acids,
5359.51 will trigger these neurons to signal
5361.96 to the brain to increase dopamine.
5363.26 And it is not coincidental
5364.97 that omega-3 fatty acid
supplementation can help ameliorate
5368.53 some of the symptoms of ADHD
5371.76 by way of presumably increasing dopamine
5374.98 in this neuropod to dopamine pathway
5377.19 that we talked about earlier.
5379.21 The whole thing has a very
nice logical structure to it.
5381.95 And points to yet again,
5383.89 the immense value of
bringing the proper amounts,
5387.63 maybe even supplementing
the proper amounts
5389.57 of omega-3 fatty acids and the
proper amounts of amino acids
5392.93 into the gut as a way to supplant
5395.96 some of the stimulation of these pathways
5398.04 that would otherwise be caused by sugar.
5401.47 There's actually a version
of this where one could say,
5404.15 if you want to reduce sugar cravings,
5406.82 you might consider
increasing certain forms
5410.61 of amino acid intake or certain
forms of fatty acid intake.
5413.83 So what are some ways that we
can reduce our sugar cravings,
5417.23 and ideally ways that we can do that,
5420.05 that also benefit us in other ways,
5422.6 both nutritionally and from
the neuroscience standpoint?
5425.42 Well, these neuropod cells that respond to
5429.28 and signal the brain when we
ingest sugar, as I mentioned,
5433.29 also respond to amino acids
and essential fatty acids.
5436.26 We already talked about
the essential fatty acids.
5438.78 I make it a particular
point to ingest anywhere
5440.8 from one to three grams, that's grams,
5443.99 of EPA essential fatty acid per day.
5447.22 I make it a point to do
that with the ingestion
5448.79 of high quality omega-3s.
5451.09 For me, the simplest way to do that,
5453.15 and I think for most people,
the lowest cost way to do that,
5456.46 is to use some liquid form of fish oil
5458.37 or some capsule form of fish oil.
5460.12 You really do have to see
how much essential fatty acid
5463.12 in the form of EPA is in those.
5465.3 If you try and do that
only through capsules,
5468.02 it can get kind of expensive,
5469.14 depending on which
particular brands you use,
5472.6 some have more EPA, some less.
5474.32 You can, of course also
do this through foods,
5476.16 you can do this with non fish sources,
5477.76 through things like algae,
and there's some other forms,
5480.23 you can look it up online now,
5481.86 plant-based sources of EPAs,
5484.18 you can do this with
high quality fish oil.
5486.83 In any case, that does
seem at least based on
5491.21 a modest amount, but
nonetheless solid literature,
5495.43 to reduce sugar cravings somewhat,
5498.44 but that could easily be by
mere replacement of calories.
5502.06 So we don't know yet
based on human studies,
5504.67 whether or not the ingestion of those EPAs
5506.47 is specifically activating
the neuropod cells,
5508.86 which specifically
activates dopamine release
5511.66 and bypasses the need for,
or the craving for sugar.
5515.19 We don't know that yet.
5516.21 But logically, it holds up to assume that.
5520.62 The fact that these neuropod cells
5522.25 and I should say other
neurons within the gut
5524.69 respond very robustly to the presence
5527.95 of particular amino acids
is also a potential lever
5533.04 by which one could reduce sugar cravings.
5534.78 And there's an interesting literature
5536.77 around the amino acid, glutamine,
5538.63 in particular supplementing
with the amino acid, glutamine,
5541.48 as it relates to sugar cravings,
5543.84 and certainly as it relates
to other aspects of the gut,
5547.73 in particular leaky gut.
5549.6 The use of supplemental glutamine
to try and treat leaky gut
5552.7 is not a new phenomenon.
5554.33 There are other approaches too, of course.
5556.3 But there are many people
who are experimenting
5559.35 with supplementing with
glutamine, several grams per day,
5563.22 often even, you know, five
grams distributed through
5566.56 three or four different
servings throughout the day
5569.41 as a way to blunt their sugar cravings.
5571.61 Now there has not yet been
a large scale clinical trial
5575.94 using glutamine to reduce sugar cravings,
5577.81 but the results of the few
studies that I looked at,
5581.35 as well as my understanding of the logic
5583.66 of these neuro circuits,
including the neuropod cells,
5586.47 brings us to a conclusion
that it makes sense
5590.1 why if there's a population
of neurons within our gut,
5593.28 that responds very robustly
5594.87 to the presence of sugar,
fatty acids, or amino acids,
5598.53 that the intake of particular amino acids
5601.2 would allow the dopamine pathways
5603.73 that might otherwise be triggered by sugar
5606.35 to be triggered by
something like glutamine,
5608.62 which has very few or no calories.
5611.19 And in fact, having talked
about this previously,
5614.21 a number of people that I
know went out and tried this,
5617.69 now this is of course is
what I call anec data, right?
5620.714 This is not a quality peer reviewed study,
5623.58 this is anec data.
5625.74 Many of them have reported back
5627.56 that they actually feel
as if their sugar cravings
5629.87 are reduced.
5631.0 I know some people who
actually take glutamine
5632.847 and mix it with full fat cream
5634.51 and take it kind of like
a shot of full fat cream,
5636.07 which sounds absolutely
delicious by the way,
5637.72 glutamine is a little bit chalky,
5638.85 so it's not that great
tasting to ingest with sugar.
5642.01 I should mention, if you do
try and take this approach
5643.99 of ingesting glutamine
to reduce sugar cravings,
5646.82 you want to increase
the amount of glutamine
5648.41 that you take somewhat gradually.
5649.93 It can create some gastric distress
5652.06 if you just, you know,
5652.893 I certainly wouldn't take
a big table spoon of it,
5654.51 throw it in water and chug
it down three times a day.
5656.55 Some of you with very hardy stomachs
5657.96 can probably tolerate that.
5659.007 You know, if you're like my bulldog,
5662.7 which unfortunately
passed away, but Costello,
5664.47 I always imagine that if ever
we did an autopsy on him,
5666.5 he'd have like a license plate
5667.68 and like a human being in his gut,
5669.49 'cause it seemed like
he could ingest anything
5671.07 with no issues,
5671.903 but of course, many people
have kind of sensitive guts.
5674.52 So if you're going to try taking glutamine
5677.35 as a means to reduce sugar cravings,
5679.02 just know that the
studies are still ongoing.
5681.3 Some people have achieved benefit.
5683.49 Please also realize that
there's an entire literature
5685.78 devoted to the potential
hazards of increasing glutamine
5689.466 if you have a preexisting cancer.
5692.45 So if you have cancer
or you're cancer prone,
5694.64 I would really discourage
you from this approach.
5696.67 And in any case, as always,
talk to your doctor.
5699.84 The logic nonetheless is there,
5701.44 why increasing amino acid
intake or fatty acid intake
5705.82 might decrease sugar craving.
5708.73 Now there are other ways
to reduce sugar craving
5711.74 and there are certainly
ways to reduce the sharp
5714.98 rise in blood glucose that can occur
5717.42 when we ingest sugary sweet foods
5719.63 or even just an abundance
of carbohydrate foods,
5722.5 and there are a huge
number of these things.
5724.59 I'm going to sort of
layer up through the ones
5727.08 that you might find in your
cupboard, at the grocery store,
5729.04 and then get into some
of the more extravagant
5731.75 or I should say, esoteric ones,
5734.12 many of which however can be quite potent.
5736.6 The first of which is
simple lemon juice, right,
5740.99 or lime juice.
5742.4 There was an old lore
and actually some papers,
5745.54 pointing to the idea that
the ingestion of vinegar,
5748.89 either white vinegar or wine vinegar,
5751.93 could somehow blunt blood glucose
5754.66 after the ingestion of sugary foods
5756.3 or the ingestion of a lot
of carbohydrate foods,
5758.44 or even just a big meal.
5760.29 Actually, Tim Ferris, I should
say the great Tim Ferris,
5763.01 'cause I do have great
respect for the fact
5764.57 that he seems to be about 10
years ahead of everything,
5768.07 both in terms of nutrition
and skill learning
5770.17 and things of that sort,
5771.003 many of the things that
he predicted in his books,
5773.457 "The Four Hour Body"
and "The Four Hour Chef"
5775.75 actually turned out to be
true based on scientific data,
5779.31 some of which only exists
in the animal models,
5781.25 but now also some predictions
that played out to be true
5786.51 in both the animal models
and and the human models.
5788.58 So I think that Tim
certainly deserves a hat tip
5793.55 for the fact that he
experimented with these methods
5796.036 and reported his experiences
with those methods
5799.32 and that now some of them, many of them,
5801.73 have been validated by
what I perceive to be
5803.85 quality science.
5805.25 He talked about the fact that,
5807.06 at least in his experiments on himself,
5809.66 the ingestion of vinegar
did not seem to blunt
5813.47 blood glucose, and he was using
continuous glucose monitors.
5816.13 These incidentally, another
example of where Ferris
5818.53 was early to the game and the rest of us
5821.08 are kind of just in his wake.
5822.7 He talked about the use
of blood glucose monitors,
5825.78 those, I think at the time
were implanted below the skin.
5827.94 Nowadays there are less
invasive blood glucose monitors,
5831.09 things like Levels and so forth,
5832.31 and these are actually
becoming pretty popular.
5834.1 I've worn one of these before.
5835.25 They're actually pretty informative.
5837.22 I learned for instance,
that when I go in the sauna
5839.94 that I experience a sharp
rise in blood glucose.
5843.37 And that makes sense because
of the dehydration associated
5847.23 with being in the sauna,
a lot of sweating,
5848.66 the concentration of sugar
in the bloodstream goes up.
5851.41 So there's some other
things that certain foods
5853.12 affect my blood glucose
one way or another.
5854.58 It's kind of an interesting
and fun experiment
5856.97 that some of you might be
interested in doing as well.
5859.88 Regardless, there are now
data pointing to the fact
5863.69 that lemon juice and lime juice,
5866.37 a couple tablespoons or so,
5868.5 if ingested before, or
even during, or even after,
5871.39 consumption of sugary foods,
5873.34 or I should say foods that
sharply increase blood glucose
5877.13 or large carbohydrate meals,
5878.66 can actually blunt the
blood glucose response.
5880.89 And I did see that when I did
my own experiments on myself
5884.29 with a continuous glucose monitor,
5886.59 it was kind of fun to
do those experiments.
5889.66 I preferred to do those experiments
5891.05 by eating somewhat larger meals
5892.72 of things that didn't
contain a lot of sugar.
5894.8 I saw some big increases in blood glucose
5896.62 in certain instances,
5897.5 and then I would ingest some
lemon juice or lime juice,
5900.26 typically mixed in with water.
5901.73 And sure enough, you could see a blunting
5903.42 of the blood glucose response.
5904.67 And of course this was
real time, continuous,
5907.83 hence continuous, blood
glucose monitoring.
5910.97 So for those of you that are interested
5913.0 in blunting your blood sugar
response, certain foods,
5917.27 that's a simple, low cost way to do that,
5919.33 if you want to explore it.
5920.18 I will say, if you are fasting
5923.02 and you already have low blood glucose,
5925.18 and you ingest lemon juice,
5927.77 or I should say some lemon juice and water
5929.53 or lime juice and water,
5931.3 be careful because you can
actually become hypoglycemic.
5934.72 For the very same reasons
that that lemon juice
5937.82 and lime juice can blunt blood glucose
5939.67 when your blood glucose
levels are moderate to high,
5942.51 you can also reduce blood
glucose levels even further
5945.01 when blood glucose levels are low.
5947.77 Now that's lemon juice
and lime juice there.
5950.16 But we can't say that has
to do with acidic things,
5953.15 generally.
5954.21 And just as a side point,
5956.12 many of you have probably
seen in the store,
5957.96 so called adjusted pH
waters or foods and drinks
5961.42 that are supposed to adjust your pH.
5963.01 Hate to break it to you,
5963.92 but your pH is very tightly regulated
5966.47 throughout your brain and body.
5967.95 You do not want this to change.
5969.7 It is entirely impossible,
at least in any safe way,
5973.8 that you would become
quote unquote more alkaline
5975.99 by ingesting an alkaline
water or something like that.
5978.4 It is true that the pH,
your alkalinity and acidity
5982.17 varies in different
compartments in your body,
5983.9 that's important.
5985.27 Unless you are hemorrhaging or vomiting,
5988.22 or there's something badly
wrong with you, health wise,
5990.69 and you're in a really dire circumstance,
5992.78 you don't want big shifts in your body pH
5994.82 and your body has all sorts
of ways of buffering against
5998.37 changes in pH.
5999.39 So I encourage you not to fall on the,
6002.65 or hop on the bandwagon of adjusting pH
6005.11 and becoming less acidic,
and that kind of thing.
6006.72 When you ingest lemon juice or lime juice,
6008.77 the mechanism by which
it blunts blood glucose
6011.56 is probably twofold.
6013.27 One is probably through
the post-ingestive effects
6017.19 of glucose in the gut,
6018.56 meaning the way in which
sugars are interacting
6022.85 with neurons and other
components of your gut circuitry
6026.34 to impact things like
gastric emptying time,
6030.48 to impact things like the
firing of those neuropod cells
6033.907 and their signaling to the brain.
6035.84 But almost certainly it
has something to do also
6040.12 with the perception of
sour taste on the tongue.
6043.29 We didn't go into this too
much today, but you, of course,
6047.35 don't just have sweet taste
receptors in your mouth,
6049.86 you also have bitter taste receptors,
6051.26 you have salty taste receptors,
6053.09 you have sour taste
receptors in your mouth
6055.34 and of course, that means
your tongue and palate.
6058.5 And those are interacting.
6060.37 If you ingest a substance that's
just sweet or mostly sweet,
6065.98 that causes a certain set of
effects on your blood glucose,
6068.85 but also your brain, dopamine,
6070.51 and the other neuro
circuits of your brain.
6072.65 If you also ingest something that's sour
6075.77 like lemon juice or lime juice,
6077.85 it adjusts the output
of those neural circuits
6080.94 in your brain.
6081.86 So again, where you have a situation
6083.63 where you have two parallel pathways,
6085.29 one that's post-ingestive
coming from phenomenon
6087.83 within our gut neurons,
6090.02 but also things like
gastric emptying time,
6091.67 the clearance and transfer of food,
6095.55 and the conversion of food
into particular nutrients
6098.47 and the circulation of
glucose in your bloodstream
6101.39 and how it gets into the brain.
6102.7 But also simply by
ingesting something sour,
6105.96 you are changing the way
6107.02 that sweet things impact your brain.
6110.3 And so I think it stands to reason
6112.49 that the lemon juice/lime juice effect
6115.19 is not going to be magic.
6117.1 It's going to have
everything to do with the way
6118.8 that ingesting sour foods
can adjust the taste.
6122.57 Excuse me, can adjust the neural response
6125.62 to taste of sweet foods.
6127.0 And in fact, we know based
on the beautiful work
6129.36 of Charles Zuker at
Columbia Medical School,
6133.15 that that's exactly what I happens.
6134.88 They've measured the activity of neurons
6137.15 at various locations in the so-called
6138.82 taste pathways of the brain.
6140.43 And they found that when particular tastes
6143.47 like just sweet or just
bitter or just sour
6145.86 evoke certain ensembles of neurons to fire
6148.7 in particular sequences,
6150.36 when sweet and sour are co-ingested,
6152.84 when bitter and sour are co-ingested,
6155.53 you get distinct ensembles,
6157.53 meaning distinct patterns of
activity of those neurons.
6160.03 And of course, distinct
patterns of downstream activity
6163.25 within the brain and body.
6164.41 So while it is still somewhat mysterious
6167.48 as to how exactly things like
lemon juice and lime juice
6170.69 can reduce our blood glucose spikes.
6173.73 When we ingest those with sweet foods
6176.51 or carbohydrate laden
foods, or with big meals,
6179.74 you can use this as a tool
with the understanding
6181.69 that there's a grounding in the biology
6183.65 of the way these circuits work.
6185.14 Now, some of you have
probably heard that cinnamon
6187.22 can be a useful tool for
controlling blood sugar.
6189.4 And indeed that's the case.
6190.93 It's very clear that cinnamon can adjust
6193.69 the rate of glucose entry into the stream,
6196.5 possibly by changing the
rate of gastric emptying,
6199.9 it might slow the rate of gastric emptying
6202.88 and thereby also reduce the glycemic index
6206.22 of particular foods.
6207.22 So I suppose if I were
going to eat a mango,
6209.72 and I hadn't just done a
bunch of hard training,
6211.62 I might sprinkle some cinnamon on it here.
6213.58 I always enjoy kind of
coming up with new ideas
6215.41 of ways that I can eat
foods during these podcasts.
6218.19 In any event, there's
some debate out there,
6219.96 if you look online as to
whether or not Saigon Cinnamon,
6222.08 Cassia cinnamon, excuse me,
or Ceylon cinnamon is best
6226.09 for purposes of blunting
blood glucose spikes.
6229.63 But I think the, at least
by my read of the data
6234.39 and from what I've found,
6235.57 it doesn't really matter
provided it's real cinnamon.
6237.82 And you have to actually
look and make sure
6239.67 that it's real cinnamon,
6240.93 because a lot of cinnamon
that you buy is not real.
6243.38 I do want to provide a cautionary
note about cinnamon however.
6246.63 Cinnamon contains
something called coumarin.
6249.27 which can be toxic at high levels.
6252.27 So you don't want to ingest
more than about a teaspoon,
6255.67 maybe a teaspoon and a
half of cinnamon per day,
6258.87 because you'll start
to exceed the threshold
6260.49 at which cinnamon could
start to be problematic.
6263.37 But certainly if you're
going to have a big meal
6266.57 or a meal that has a lot of sugar in it,
6269.14 or a lot of carbohydrate laden foods,
6271.61 and you don't want an
increase in blood glucose,
6274.1 you could put cinnamon in a beverage,
6276.96 you could put cinnamon on food
6278.25 in order to blunt that
blood glucose increase,
6281.58 reduce the glycemic index
6282.81 by way of reducing gastric emptying time.
6284.7 Again, just making sure
that you don't get out past
6287.15 that one and a half teaspoons per day,
6288.897 'cause you really don't
want to start dealing
6291.41 with any of the toxicity
related to coumarin.
6293.34 So we've talked about
lemon juice and lime juice
6295.58 and cinnamon, these
are kind of commonplace
6297.2 in many kitchens.
6299.67 Then of course we can venture
into the more esoteric
6303.07 or I would say the more advanced tools
6304.87 for adjusting sugar intake.
6307.72 And the one that comes to
mind is of course Berberine.
6311.97 Berberine is a derivative of tree bark
6314.6 and it is a very, very potent substance
6317.17 for reducing blood glucose.
6318.33 So much so that it is on par with
6320.72 Metformin or Glibenclamide,
6322.49 which are prescription
drugs specifically used
6325.45 to reduce blood glucose.
6327.43 So using Berberine is a serious step,
6330.62 you should absolutely talk
to your doctor about it.
6333.0 I know of a number of people that use it
6334.34 to lower blood glucose when
they eat really large meals.
6337.73 I know the number of
people that are using it
6339.67 to get to some of the
other effects of Metformin
6343.59 that people have discussed,
6344.61 things like activating or
tapping into the so-called
6348.314 AMPK pathway, reducing mTOR,
6350.33 these are people that are
aiming their activities
6354.05 at increasing longevity,
6355.99 a somewhat controversial approach, still,
6358.06 but I know many people are doing it.
6360.72 It is true that if you ingest Berberine,
6363.1 your blood glucose will plummet.
6365.46 And I point that out because
I've actually tried it before,
6368.1 it gave me brutal headaches
and I felt really dizzy,
6371.7 and I felt like I couldn't see straight.
6373.78 And actually I couldn't see
straight, why did it do that?
6376.48 Well, it made me hypoglycemic.
6378.58 It actually drove my blood
glucose down too far.
6381.85 And the reason it did that
6383.18 is that I took Berberine
on an empty stomach.
6385.82 I know some people can tolerate it.
6388.43 I would say, be very cautious
about ingesting Berberine
6390.98 on an empty stomach,
6391.813 or if you are in a low carbohydrate diet,
6394.2 unless you really know what you're doing
6395.67 and you have a medical professional
6396.99 to kind of guide you through that.
6399.66 If I took Berberine along
with a very large meal,
6403.64 that included a lot of
carbohydrates, you know,
6405.79 I can recall the days in
which Costello and I would eat
6408.61 a couple of pizzas and then
we might get ice cream,
6411.11 that kind of thing.
6411.943 Then I felt perfectly fine
on even up to 750 milligrams
6415.78 or a gram of Berberine.
6417.42 It has the kind of unique
property of making you feel
6420.9 not overwhelmed by the amount
of blood glucose increase
6424.55 that you're experiencing
from eating a big meal.
6426.4 I don't quite know how
else to describe it.
6428.55 It's almost as if you can keep
eating and eating and eating,
6430.95 and of course you have to
protect your gastric volume.
6435.62 I mean, you only have so
much space in your stomach
6437.45 to ingest food.
6439.12 I wasn't using it to gorge on
food, I just heard about it,
6441.73 I was interested in experimenting with it.
6443.13 I don't have any chronic
blood sugar issues.
6445.76 But again, when I took
it on an empty stomach,
6447.64 it made me hypoglycemic on
a low carbohydrate intake,
6451.45 hypoglycemic, not a good experience.
6454.52 And again, an experience I think to avoid.
6457.84 But provided there's a lot of
glucose in your bloodstream,
6460.52 and certainly if you are
of the experimental type
6464.05 or you're trying to
regulate blood glucose,
6465.85 Berberine might be a good option.
6467.54 But again, talk to your doctor.
6469.56 It does have some other
interesting effects
6471.25 in terms of lowering total cholesterol
6473.61 that are research supported
6475.64 of reducing insulin a little bit.
6478.48 Well, that's not surprising
if you reduce blood glucose,
6480.47 you're going to reduce
insulin because of course,
6482.21 insulin manages blood
glucose in the bloodstream.
6485.5 So I would place Berberine and of course,
6487.58 Metformin and Glibenclamide in
the kind of the heavy hitting
6491.74 potent tools for regulating blood glucose.
6494.95 Now, this is an episode,
not about sugar per se,
6497.83 but sugar viewed through the
lens of the nervous system.
6500.68 And what's interesting about
6501.64 Berberine, Metformin, Glibenclamide
and related substances,
6505.36 is that some of the
effects are of course on
6509.21 gastric emptying or
buffering blood glucose
6511.1 within the bloodstream, et cetera.
6513.86 But there appeared to also
be some neural effects
6517.33 of having chronically low glucose
6520.88 or blunting blood glucose
through things like Berberine.
6524.56 And some of those neural effects include
6527.2 longstanding changes in
the hormonal cascades
6531.03 that are the consequence
of having low blood sugar
6533.39 and thereby, changes
in the neural circuits
6536.75 that manage blood glucose overall.
6538.89 The simple way of saying
this is that by maintaining
6542.32 low to moderate blood glucose,
6543.84 either by not ingesting heavily
carbohydrate laden foods.
6547.57 So here I'm speaking to the
low carb or the ketogenic types
6550.78 or by blunting blood
glucose through things like
6553.59 Metformin or Berberine,
6555.64 even if ingesting carbohydrates,
maybe even some sugars,
6558.47 over time, it seems that
there's a adjustment,
6561.7 what we call a homeostatic regulation
6564.0 of the neural circuits
that control things like
6565.89 sugar craving, and indeed,
6567.8 some people report feeling
fewer sugar cravings over time.
6571.73 Now I didn't use Berberine for
a very long period of time,
6574.94 I've never used Metformin.
6576.56 I have experienced a somewhat
odd but welcome phenomenon
6580.16 of with each progressive year of my life,
6582.93 I have fewer and fewer sugar cravings.
6585.76 Why that is, I don't know.
6586.99 I suspect it might have
something to do with my sleep.
6589.34 And I'll talk about that in a few minutes.
6591.28 But if you're going to explore
6592.64 Berberine or Metformin or otherwise,
6594.15 in addition to working with a doctor,
6596.08 I think you should understand
why you're doing it, right.
6598.72 I think that many of the
effects can be quite potent.
6601.81 They can happen in both the immediate term
6604.14 in terms of regulating blood glucose,
6605.86 they can send you hypoglycemic
if you aren't careful,
6609.29 they can also cause longstanding changes
6612.34 to the neural circuitry that regulates
6613.95 blood sugar over time.
6615.03 Some of which might be
welcome changes, right?
6616.95 Reduce sugar cravings for instance.
6619.04 And if you are really, really serious
6621.69 about modulating blood glucose
6623.55 through things like Berberine,
6625.4 the typical dose range, again,
6626.87 is anywhere from half a
gram to 1.5 grams daily,
6630.59 that's the typical dosages
that have been explored.
6633.22 And there are some other
substances like sodium caprate
6637.61 which are known to augment
the effects of Berberine
6640.16 via the AMPK pathways.
6642.23 They basically can increase
the ability for Berberine
6645.21 to have its glucose lowering actions.
6647.37 But that of course is getting
into the really potent,
6649.84 what I would call sharp blade tools
6651.63 for controlling blood glucose.
6653.6 And listen, anytime you're
dealing with blood glucose,
6656.88 you are dealing with the brain's
preferred source of fuel.
6660.15 And anytime you're dealing
6660.983 with the brain's preferred source of fuel,
6663.3 you have to be especially cautious
6664.81 about depriving the
brain of what it needs.
6667.05 So whether or not you're
low carb, high carb,
6670.16 you know, keto, vegan,
carnivore, these substances,
6673.36 like Berberine, are very, very potent
6675.07 and you need to take them seriously.
6676.7 There is yet another tool for
controlling sugar cravings
6680.01 and the neural circuits
that regulate sugar craving
6683.76 and its downstream consequences.
6686.33 And this tool is what I would
call a high performance tool,
6690.25 but it's one that you
probably didn't suspect
6693.89 and that's sleep.
6696.02 I've done extensive episodes about sleep,
6698.7 and we actually have an episode
called master your sleep.
6702.02 You can find that episode
easily at hubermanlab.com.
6704.46 It's available in all the various formats,
6706.03 YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera.
6707.91 and it provides a lot of tools.
6709.69 And on social media, I
provide a lot of tools,
6711.67 often we have a newsletter
that provides tools
6713.2 on how to maximize sleep.
6716.2 What is the role of sleep
in sugar metabolism,
6720.58 sugar, hunger, and the way that the brain
6723.41 regulates those things?
6724.66 Well, there's a really
exciting study that came out
6728.25 just last year.
6730.017 This study was published in
the journal, Cell Report,
6731.94 a Cell Press journal, excellent journal.
6734.12 And the reason I love this study so much,
6736.1 is it involved having people,
6737.48 so yes, this was done in
humans, sleep in the laboratory.
6740.56 That's not unusual, there's
a sleep lab at Stanford,
6742.77 there's sleep labs elsewhere.
6744.42 But what they did was
they actually measured
6747.77 from the breath of these people,
6750.27 and they extracted from their breath,
6753.34 the metabolites that would allow them
6755.39 to understand what sorts of metabolism
6758.28 was occurring in these people's bodies
6760.05 at different phases of sleep.
6762.17 And this is a really remarkable study.
6764.2 They actually did this every 10 seconds
6767.7 throughout the entire night.
6768.8 So in little tiny 10 second bits,
6770.85 meaning at very high resolution,
6772.48 they could evaluate what is the metabolism
6774.26 in the brain and body
that people experience
6776.28 as they go from REM sleep,
rapid eye movement sleep
6778.59 to slow wave, sleep, and so on.
6780.79 And I'll go deeper into the
study again in the future,
6783.55 because it's so interesting,
and I think so important.
6785.8 But what they discovered
was that each stage of sleep
6789.43 was associated with a very
particular signature pattern
6792.43 of metabolism and
particular phases of sleep
6796.15 are associated with sugar metabolism,
6798.62 or more with fat metabolism,
6800.5 or more with other aspects of metabolism.
6803.21 And the reason why I think
this study is important
6806.22 to discuss in the context
of today's discussion
6808.61 about sugar in the brain,
6810.15 is that many people have experienced
6813.84 the effects of disrupted
sleep on their appetite.
6816.96 And in particular, it's been
reported that when people
6819.91 are sleep deprived or the quality
6821.79 of their sleep is disrupted,
6823.69 that their appetite for
sugary food increases.
6826.78 Now that was always assumed to
be due to some metabolic need
6832.3 that was triggered by
the sleep deprivation
6834.12 or by the poor sleep.
6835.59 But in reading over this study,
6836.78 some of the more important
points made by the authors
6839.12 relate to the fact that well,
6840.71 sleep is known to have
incredibly important effects
6843.56 on brain and body, for
a variety of systems,
6845.92 immune system, neural
functioning, et cetera.
6848.88 This very organized sequence of particular
6852.57 forms of metabolism being active
6854.89 during particular phases of sleep,
6856.57 which are very, very well orchestrated,
6858.52 as we know, slow wave sleep, and REM sleep
6860.91 being orchestrated in 90 minutes,
6862.36 so-called ultradian cycles
and so on and so forth,
6865.9 is thought to of perhaps
set up the brain and body
6869.21 to be able to regulate
itself in the waking hours.
6872.4 And therefore, when
people are sleep deprived
6875.12 or deprived of certain forms
or states within sleep,
6878.81 such as rapid eye movement sleep,
6882.06 that it creates a disruption
6883.94 in a particular set of metabolic pathways.
6886.66 Now we don't a leap
too far from this study
6888.77 to sugar metabolism
and the neural circuits
6890.64 controlling sugar metabolism.
6892.3 But I will say this, if
you look at the sum total
6896.03 of the data on obesity
or on type two diabetes
6900.7 or on metabolic syndromes of any kind,
6902.9 you almost always see
disruptions in sleep.
6906.53 Now, some of those could
be you do to sleep apnea
6909.27 caused by even just the
size of somebody's neck
6912.01 or the weight of their body.
6914.89 In other words, we don't know
the direction of the effect,
6917.27 metabolic syndromes could disrupt sleep,
6919.03 which disrupt metabolic syndromes.
6920.77 And indeed the authors point
out quite appropriately,
6923.84 that they don't understand the direction
6925.8 of the effects that they observe either.
6928.16 But there is now a plethora
of data pointing to the fact
6932.35 that getting quality sleep each night
6934.52 helps regulate not only appetite,
6937.31 but also the specific forms of metabolism
6939.76 that drive specific appetites.
6942.18 So the takeaway is,
6944.33 while there are extravagant
and potent and interesting ways
6949.89 to regulate blood glucose,
6950.97 everything from cinnamon to
lemon juice, to Berberine,
6953.18 to sodium caprate, to behavioral tools,
6956.17 to the mere understanding of how
6957.69 the direct and indirect pathways
6960.0 go from the gut to dopamine, et cetera,
6963.3 if you're not establishing
the firm foundation
6966.38 of proper metabolism,
6969.12 all of those things are going
to be sort of rearranging
6972.5 deck chairs on the Titanic
as it's sometimes described.
6975.92 So we can't overstate the importance
6977.27 of getting regular sufficient
amount of high quality sleep,
6981.29 at least 80% of the time,
6982.867 not for sake of immune system
function, for clear thinking,
6985.86 et cetera, but also for properly
regulating our metabolism,
6990.2 including our sugar metabolism.

7045.75 During today's episode,
7046.78 and on many previous episodes
of The Huberman Lab Podcast,
7049.48 I've discussed supplements.
7050.86 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
7053.07 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them.
7055.36 One issue with supplements
7056.51 is that if you're going to take them,
7058.3 you want to make sure that they have
7059.32 the absolute highest quality.
7061.07 For that reason, we've
partnered with Thorne,
7063.01 that's T-H-O-R-N-E,
7065.04 'cause Thorn has partnered for instance,
7067.14 with all the major sports
teams and the Mayo Clinic.
7070.37 There's tremendous trust in the fact
7071.96 that Thorne supplements contain
7073.64 the specific amounts of supplements
7075.19 that are listed on the bottle
7076.16 and that the quality of the
ingredients they include
7078.41 are of the very highest standards.
7081.35 If you want to see the
supplements that I take,
7082.88 you can go to thorne.com/U/Huberman,
7087.1 and you can get 20% off any of
the supplements listed there.
7090.28 Also, if you navigate
further into the Thorne site,
7092.59 through that portal,
thorne.com/U/Huberman,
7095.74 you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements
7098.34 that Thorne makes.
7099.29 Also, if you haven't yet signed up
7100.61 for the Huberman Lab
