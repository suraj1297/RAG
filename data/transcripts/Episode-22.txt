0.0 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast.
1.92 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.95 for everyday life.
6.362 [bright music]
9.36 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology
12.12 and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.
15.18 Today, we are discussing cannabis,
17.16 also referred to as marijuana.
19.5 Cannabis includes many different compounds
21.487 that have profound impact
on the brain and body,
25.02 so while many of you have
probably heard of THC,
27.75 there are also compounds
in cannabis such as CBD,
31.14 and of course there are different types
32.67 or strains of cannabis,
33.84 including sativa strains
and indica strains
36.45 and hybrid strains, and believe it or not,
38.94 nowadays, there is also
an entire literature,
41.94 meaning a scientific
and medicinal literature
44.01 about type one, type two
and type three strains.
46.2 I'll explain what all of
that is and how they work.
49.02 I'll talk about some of
the medicinal applications
51.27 of different strains of cannabis
52.77 and combinations of cannabis strains,
54.9 as well as some of the
potential health hazards
57.6 of cannabis use.
59.28 I want to emphasize that any
discussion about cannabis
61.44 has to be framed within the context
63.18 that the legality of
cannabis varies tremendously
67.02 depending on where you are in the world,
68.49 so depending on which country you're in
71.16 and even which state you're in
72.48 or which area within a country,
74.384 possessing and using and
certainly selling cannabis
77.43 can be either highly
illegal or entirely legal
80.49 or decriminalized or largely overlooked.
83.28 You, of course, are obligated to know
85.44 what those local laws are for you,
87.247 where you live and where you travel.
90.03 With that said, today's discussion
92.34 really will include a full picture
95.1 as to where cannabis and the various
98.4 and even very specific
compounds within cannabis
100.44 can be extremely useful in
the treatment of some ailments
104.19 and where certain compounds in cannabis
106.83 can be extremely dangerous for
certain individuals to use,
110.25 in particular, individuals
that have preexisting,
113.231 genetic propensity for psychosis.
116.22 That theme is going to
come up again and again,
117.93 but we are also going to talk
about the role of cannabis
120.45 in anxiety and depression,
122.76 both positive and negative effects.
124.47 We'll talk about sex differences
125.7 in terms of women versus men
128.16 and how they react
differently to cannabis,
129.96 and I would be entirely remiss
131.55 if I didn't include a
conversation about cannabis,
134.52 meaning THC, CBD, hybrid
strains, et cetera
137.85 in creativity and different
modes of thinking,
140.49 because as many of you probably know
142.62 or at least have heard about,
144.57 cannabis can impact the way that we think,
147.27 the types of memory systems we can access
149.49 and what's called convergent
and divergent thinking,
151.38 which is one way of conceptualizing
153.72 what is commonly referred
to as creativity.
156.87 So today's discussion is going to include
159.27 a lot of information,
160.47 but I promise to make it clear
and accessible to all of you,
162.96 regardless of whether or
not you have a background
164.79 in biology or not,
166.35 and today's discussion
will also be quite nuanced.
169.38 You'll find me routinely reading
171.18 directly from specific research papers,
173.34 something that of course we
always do on this podcast,
176.252 but today I'm really going to dig
177.96 into some of the finer points
of the methodology in papers
181.44 and some of the statistics that were used
183.81 and the specific populations
of people that were studied,
186.66 because as it turns out,
187.92 there are instances that we will discuss
189.75 in which the use of cannabis
can be immensely beneficial
193.17 to one group and yet can
be entirely detrimental
196.59 to another group, even
at equivalent dosages
199.097 and depending on a number
of different factors,
201.6 so we will discuss what those factors are.
203.82 Just to give you a brief overview
205.56 of the kind of structure I'm
going to put on today's episode,
208.56 we will review of course,
cannabis and its various forms.
211.47 I'll talk about some of the biology,
212.55 but we are going to really
drill into how dosage,
216.15 that is the concentration
of THC relative to CBD,
219.461 impacts whether or not cannabis
221.7 is going to have one effect or another.
223.14 We will also talk about
the frequency of use,
226.32 daily use, multiple times per day use,
229.08 weekly use or monthly or occasional use.
231.51 We will also talk about
different professions
233.64 and how some people may have
a little bit more leeway
235.86 in terms of whether or not
they decide to use cannabis
238.62 or any of its various component
chemical constituents,
242.31 that is CBD or THC, et cetera.
244.92 And for other professions,
246.72 it might be entirely inappropriate
248.31 because of the particular
kinds of cognitive tasks
250.65 those professions demand.
252.12 We will also talk about
genetic predisposition,
254.76 again, sex differences, hormone effects,
256.54 and I will also touch on what I think
258.33 is the most important variable
260.25 in determining whether or not cannabis
262.62 is right or wrong for
you, and that is your age
267.0 at which you are considering starting
268.74 or continuing use or ceasing use.
271.23 What I can assure you is that
by the end of today's podcast,
274.11 you will have a quite thorough
understanding of cannabis,
277.41 how it works, what it does,
279.09 what its potential benefits can be,
280.95 what its potential hazards are,
283.05 and whether or not it's right for you
284.85 and the people that you know.
286.02 I'm excited to announce that
the Huberman Lab Podcast
288.09 has now launched a premium channel.
289.95 The purpose of the premium
channel is severalfold.
291.81 First of all, I will be
hosting regular AMAs,
294.51 Ask Me Anythings, where
you can ask me anything,
296.76 and I will provide answers in depth
298.71 to your specific questions about science
300.48 and science related
tools for mental health,
302.7 physical health and performance.
304.47 Now, there is a nominal
cost to the premium channel.
306.78 It's $10 per month, or you can
pay $100 for the entire year.
310.5 I should mention, however,
312.18 that a significant portion of the funds
313.83 raised through the premium channel
315.51 are going to support not just
the "Huberman Lab Podcast,"
317.88 which we will continue to
release every Monday on schedule
321.54 of zero cost to all consumers' content
324.78 on mental health, physical
health and performance,
327.39 but proceeds from the premium channel
329.97 will also be used to fund research,
331.89 in particular research
done on human beings,
333.93 so not animal models, but on human beings,
336.0 which I think we all agree is a species
337.8 that we are most interested in.
339.99 And, we are going to
specifically fund research
342.99 that is aimed toward
developing further protocols
345.63 for mental health, physical
health and performance,
347.67 and those protocols will be distributed
349.56 through all channels, not
just the premium channel,
351.96 but through all channels,
352.793 Huberman Lab Podcast and
other media channels.
354.99 So the idea here is to
give you information
357.57 to your burning questions in depth
359.76 and allow you the opportunity
361.26 to support the kind of research
362.94 that provides those kinds of
answers in the first place.
365.67 Now, an especially exciting
feature of the premium channel
367.674 is that the Tiny Foundation
has generously offered
370.98 to do a dollar-for-dollar match
372.6 on all funds raised for research
374.52 through the premium channel.
376.26 So this is a terrific way
that they're going to amplify
378.87 whatever funds come in
through the premium channel
380.85 to further support research for science
382.89 and science-related tools
383.97 for mental health, physical
health and performance.
386.19 If you'd like to sign up
387.023 for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
388.8 again, there's a cost of $10 per month
390.87 or you can pay $100 upfront
for the entire year.
393.63 That will give you access to all the AMAs.
395.97 You can ask questions and get
answers to your questions,
398.85 and you'll of course get
answers to all the questions
401.43 that other people ask as well.
402.81 There will also be some premium content,
404.76 such as transcripts of the AMAs
406.59 and various transcripts and protocols
408.48 of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes
and not found elsewhere.
411.72 And again, you'll be supporting research
413.714 for mental health, physical
health and performance.
416.37 You can sign up for the premium channel
417.78 by going to hubermanlab.com/premium,
420.48 again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium.
423.33 Before diving into all of that,
I'd like to highlight a new,
426.3 what I think is a very useful
and zero cost resource.
430.14 This resource is what's
called Non-Sleep Deep Rest
433.62 or NSDR protocol.
435.75 I've talked many times before
on the Huberman Lab Podcast
438.0 about Non-Sleep Deep Rest, AKA, NSDR.
441.334 NSDR is sort of an umbrella term
443.71 for a variety of different practices,
446.7 so these are behavioral practices
448.2 that allow you to direct
your brain and body
450.54 into a particular state,
and most typically,
454.41 that state is one of deep relaxation,
456.21 but also one in which you
can access your bodily
460.08 and brain systems for teaching yourself
462.9 how to relax in real
time and how to recover
466.539 some of the sleep that you
may not be getting at night,
469.65 and to restore levels of dopamine
472.23 in particular areas of the
brain that are involved
474.21 in motivation and cognitive
and motor control.
477.0 Basically, NSDR is a
wonderfully restorative tool.
480.36 This has been demonstrated
many times over now
482.67 through quality peer-reviewed science,
484.29 and there are neurochemical benefits,
486.0 and there are physical benefits,
487.08 and there are certainly
psychological benefits.
489.6 I highly recommend NSDR to anybody
492.096 that has trouble falling asleep
494.67 or that wakes up in
the middle of the night
496.08 and needs to get better
at falling back asleep,
498.06 as well as to anyone out
there that has issues
500.28 with anxiety or
self-regulation of any kind.
502.77 And if you don't have any of those issues,
504.63 it's also immensely beneficial
just as a restorative
507.15 for leaning back into
focused work of any kind.
509.34 Now, a number of people have reached out
510.69 about finding NSDR protocols,
and there are a number
512.91 of different good ones
out there floating around.
516.03 I've decided to put a
zero-cost NSDR script
518.712 out there on the internet
for people to access,
521.07 so you can find it by going to YouTube
522.78 and simply put my last
name, 'Huberman' and 'NSDR'
526.5 into the search function.
528.12 This is a YouTube channel
that's hosted by Virtusan,
530.85 which has a terrific
app that includes NSDR
532.827 and a number of other health
and wellness protocols,
535.74 but they've been quite generous
536.82 in hosting a 10 minute NSDR, read by me.
540.0 This NSDR is distinct from,
541.98 although I should say,
similar to yoga nidra,
544.32 which some of you are familiar with.
546.42 This NSDR is different than yoga nidra
549.15 in the sense that it
doesn't have intentions.
551.19 There's no mystical component,
552.6 and I describe a little bit of the science
554.79 and why specific components
of the NSDR are included,
557.46 things like long exhale breathing,
559.05 I talk about perceptual shifts
560.61 and how to move from thinking and planning
562.68 to pure sensation.
563.79 If none of that makes sense right now,
565.29 it'll make total sense after
listening to the NSDR script.
568.38 Again, it's a 10 minute
NSDR script, read by me.
571.673 You can do this first thing in
the morning when you wake up,
574.35 especially if you didn't
get enough sleep that night,
576.33 and you're feeling a little bit fatigued,
578.22 and you need to lean into
the day with full vigor.
580.26 You could do it at any
point during the day
582.12 or if you wake up in
the middle of the night.
583.47 Again, this is a zero-cost
resource for you.
586.02 You can find it by going to YouTube,
587.34 put my last name in and NSDR.
589.71 I encourage you to try
it, and if you like it
592.5 or frankly, if you don't,
you can just put that
594.99 in the comment section there on YouTube,
596.91 and I've put it there as
a free resource to you,
599.61 so that you can benefit
from the research-backed,
602.808 peer-reviewed studies that point to NSDR
605.22 as a very useful practice.
607.5 Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast
609.96 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
612.72 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
614.88 to bring zero-cost to consumer information
616.8 about science and science-related tools
618.81 to the general public.
620.22 In keeping with that theme,
621.27 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
623.97 Our first sponsor is Levels.
625.56 Levels is a program that lets you see
627.57 how different foods affect your health
629.01 by giving you real-time
feedback on your diet
631.17 using a continuous glucose monitor.
633.66 One of the most important factors
634.98 in your immediate and long-term health
636.503 is how well you're
managing your blood glucose
639.06 or blood sugar.
640.08 I started using Levels about a year ago
641.91 as a way to see how different foods
643.44 and different lifestyle factors
645.42 were impacting my blood glucose levels.
647.79 So for instance, it allowed
me to see how different foods
650.07 and particular macronutrients
651.51 and combinations of macronutrients
653.46 would either peak or trough my blood sugar
657.03 or keep my blood sugar steady.
659.1 It also allowed me to see how working out
661.077 with weights or running, how
that impacted my blood glucose.
664.38 So for me, it was a fascinating
experiment unto myself
667.533 as to how my meal schedule, the
specific foods I was eating,
672.42 different combinations of
food, as I mentioned before,
674.73 and exercise were combining to regulate
677.88 this thing that we call blood sugar
679.29 and that's so vital to our health.
680.88 I think anyone that tries Levels will find
683.19 that you learn an immense
amount about what you're doing
685.71 and what you ought to be doing differently
687.27 in order to optimize your
immediate feelings of wellbeing
690.24 and your health trajectory.
691.74 If you're interested in
learning more about Levels
693.39 and trying a CGM yourself,
go to levels.link/huberman,
697.38 that's levels.link, L-I-N-K, /huberman.
701.16 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Thesis.
703.62 Thesis makes custom nootropics
705.18 that are designed for
your particular needs.
707.776 I am not a fan of the word nootropics,
709.95 because nootropics
literally means smart drugs
712.169 or smart drug, and frankly,
as a neuroscientist,
715.99 I know and every other
neuroscientist knows
718.5 that there is no neural circuit
720.33 or chemical in the brain for being smart.
722.79 There are, for instance,
neural circuits and chemicals
725.76 that increase your ability to focus
727.8 or your ability to task switch.
729.9 Thesis understands this and therefore,
731.58 has designed custom nootropics that vary
734.34 and are tailored to you
so that, for instance,
736.59 if you want to achieve focus and clarity
738.63 for one particular type of work,
740.61 there is a Nootropic for that.
742.05 Or if you'd like to have more
energy and have more focus,
745.98 there's a different Nootropic for that.
747.78 If you'd like to get your own personalized
749.28 nootropics starter kit,
750.27 you can go online to
takethesis.com/huberman,
753.57 take that three minute quiz,
754.65 and Thesis will send you
four different formulas
756.51 to try in your first month,
757.71 and then they'll work with you and iterate
759.36 to find the best formulas
for you to take ongoing.

768.72 Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
771.404 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
774.21 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
776.85 to help you better understand your body
778.47 and help you reach your health goals.
780.45 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
783.27 for the simple reason
that many of the factors
785.16 that impact your immediate
and long-term health
787.2 can only be analyzed with
a quality blood test.
789.9 With a lot of blood tests and
DNA tests out there, however,
792.54 an issue is you get information back
794.37 about lipids and hormones, et cetera,
796.83 but you don't know what to
do with that information.
798.45 With InsideTracker, they
have a personalized platform
800.684 that makes interpreting your data
803.1 and then acting on that
data very straightforward
805.65 and very directed toward
specific protocols.
808.35 What I mean by that is
you'll get information back
810.6 about hormone levels
and metabolic factors,
813.0 lipids, et cetera, and then you can look
815.19 to nutritional changes,
supplementation changes,
818.656 exercise protocol changes
and other lifestyle features
821.91 that combine or work on their own
824.16 to start to try and shift those numbers
825.78 into the range that's appropriate for you.

842.25 On many episodes of the
Huberman Lab Podcast,
844.29 we talk about supplements.
845.82 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
847.95 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them,
850.5 things like enhancing sleep
and the depth of sleep,
853.11 or for enhancing focus
and cognitive ability,
855.84 or for enhancing energy or
adjusting hormone levels
858.792 to optimal range for you.
860.73 The Huberman Lab Podcast
861.68 is now partnered with
Momentous Supplements.
863.79 We partnered with Momentous
864.81 for a number of important reasons.
866.46 First of all, the quality
of their ingredients
868.541 is exceptional, it's
really second to none.
871.17 Second of all, they ship internationally,
872.97 and that was important to us,
874.02 because a number of you reside
outside of the United States.
876.78 Third, we've worked with
Momentous very closely
878.929 to develop single-ingredient formulations.
881.73 Now, this turns out to be very important,
883.62 because if you're going
to take supplements,
885.437 you want to know what's
working for you and what isn't.
888.24 And of course, you want to
optimize the cost efficiency
891.42 and the biological efficiency
of those supplements.
894.48 To find the supplements we discuss
895.8 on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
897.0 you can go to livemomentous spelled O-U-S,
899.67 livemomentous.com/huberman,
901.95 and I should just mention that the library
903.6 of those supplements is
constantly expanding.
905.79 Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
908.91 Let's talk about cannabis,
and when we refer to cannabis,
912.42 we are indeed referring to
marijuana or the marijuana plant.
915.78 Now, cannabis plants
come in different strains
919.07 or different varieties,
and those different strains
922.32 are indeed different genetic strains.
924.893 So just as animals and humans
926.97 have different genetic backgrounds,
928.56 and they can be crossed to one another
930.18 to yield further genetic
variation in the offspring,
934.83 plants can be hybridized to one another
937.171 in various ways through grafting
939.6 or through the use of different
types of seed combinations,
942.24 et cetera, in order to
generate different strains.
945.27 There are also naturally
occurring differences
947.85 in the strains of plants,
949.56 and the cannabis plant is no exception.
952.53 So for instance, in the context
954.57 of the discussion about cannabis
956.25 and its medicinal uses
and recreational uses,
959.195 we need to distinguish
between the sativa variety,
963.512 the indica variety, a
variety called ruderalis
968.43 that's not often discussed,
970.14 and hybrids of sativa,
indica and ruderalis.
974.01 Before diving into the
different strains of cannabis
976.05 and how they impact the brain embody,
977.52 both similarly and differently,
980.61 I want to emphasize
that the cannabis plant
982.92 contains a number of different
psychoactive compounds.
986.25 Now, the most powerful of
those compounds is THC.
990.06 The technical name for it is
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.
994.779 But THC, as I'll refer to it,
997.98 is just one of the psychoactive
1000.23 and biologically active
compounds within cannabis plants.
1004.28 There's also CBD, which
is technically referred to
1008.78 as cannabidiol, and cannabidiol, CBD,
1012.923 is known to be used for
things like pain management,
1016.67 anxiety management and
other medicinal purposes.
1019.61 We will talk about the efficacy
of CBD for those purposes,
1023.09 as well as some of, believe it or not,
1024.86 some of the dangers of CBD,
1026.233 depending on where it's sourced
and the dosage, et cetera.
1030.38 So we've got THC, CBD and
also CBN or cannabinol.
1036.013 CBN is less often discussed.
1038.39 You're going to hear a lot less
1039.65 about CBN containing products out there,
1042.488 CBN containing medicines,
1044.15 but it is relevant to today's discussion,
1045.48 so it will come up a bit.
1047.09 Now, I will be sure to
provide more specificity
1049.4 to what I'm about to say,
but very broadly speaking,
1053.125 THC is largely responsible
1055.67 for the psychoactive effects of cannabis,
1058.733 that is the changes in mood,
the changes in bodily state
1062.09 and sensation, et cetera.
1064.7 Whereas CBD and to some extent,
1067.28 CBN, have profound effects
on the brain and body,
1072.2 but they don't tend to
give people the sensation
1074.42 of altered perception,
altered mood, et cetera.
1078.11 Some people might say they are
not the component of cannabis
1080.685 that, quote unquote, gets you high,
1083.15 although today, we will really drill into
1084.68 what the high itself represents
1086.72 in terms of chemical
systems in the brain body.
1089.39 And what we will soon learn is that
1092.026 what we think of as being
high actually includes
1095.81 a number of different changes
in the brain and body,
1097.88 some of which can be
best explained by CBD,
1101.03 not by THC, which runs counter
1103.4 to what most people out
there know and believe.
1106.43 So broadly speaking, we
have THC, CBD and CBN.
1110.9 But I want to point out
that the cannabis plant
1113.18 has over 70, seven-zero,
1115.122 70 different psychoactive compounds,
1117.29 many of which still have not been studied
1120.14 in isolation and in detail.
1122.18 So there's a big future
of research for cannabis
1124.799 and for THC and THC-related
psychoactive compounds,
1128.36 as well as for CBD and CBN.
1130.79 Today we're mainly going to focus
1132.189 on THC and CBD, as I mentioned before.
1135.65 I should also point out
that the cannabis plant
1137.36 has over 400 biologically
active compounds.
1140.797 So these are biologically active compounds
1142.715 that may or may not have
psychoactive properties,
1146.69 that may or may not be useful
for pain relief, et cetera.
1149.48 Again, there is a vast
landscape for exploration
1152.81 of the cannabis plant and of
hemp for what they include
1156.285 that could be beneficial
to us or detrimental to us,
1160.04 so again, a lot more work to do.
1161.84 Today, we're going to really
try and stay on target
1163.91 with what we already know
1165.77 and where there are
certain exciting mysteries
1167.974 or intriguing mysteries
1169.49 about what we ought to explore more.
1171.53 I will certainly highlight those.
1174.41 Let's go back to the different strains
1176.09 of the cannabis plant,
sativa, indica and ruderalis
1178.831 and explore how each of those
1181.67 differentially impacts the brain and body,
1184.52 because therein I think
we can start to learn
1186.59 a lot about this incredible plant
1188.6 that is the cannabis plant.
1190.31 And whether or not you
are a user of cannabis
1193.16 or whether or not you are
entirely opposed to cannabis use,
1196.49 understanding how cannabis works
1198.5 in the brain and body, itself,
is absolutely fascinating
1201.62 and can teach you a lot about
how your brain and body work
1204.83 at a basic level and
can tell you a lot about
1207.89 how your brain and body will
react to different life events
1210.29 and how your mood is
established and stabilized,
1213.26 and how your appetite is
established and stabilized
1215.896 and so on.
1217.19 So we have the three
major strains of cannabis,
1219.14 sativa, indica and ruderalis.
1221.93 And for sake of today's conversation,
1223.7 we can pretty much cross off ruderalis.
1226.04 It's not often consumed,
1228.26 and components of ruderalis
are not often consumed
1232.31 for medicinal or recreational purposes.
1235.52 Let's focus on sativa and indica.
1238.88 People will consume the
sativa variety of cannabis
1242.96 either by edible or by smoking cannabis,
1247.31 or they will consume the
indica variety of cannabis,
1250.04 again by edible or by smoking cannabis,
1253.4 or sometimes they will take
it in a transdermal form
1256.37 or a sublingual form.
1258.38 There are a bunch of different ways
1259.52 to get the cannabis into the body,
1262.52 but there's a clear distinction
between sativa and indica
1266.33 that actually shows up first
in the structure of the plant.
1269.509 At their extremes, meaning
in a pure strain of sativa,
1274.16 it tends to be a taller
plant, a longer stock,
1276.71 believe it or not,
1277.67 and actually the length of the
leaves is quite a bit longer,
1280.82 whereas the indica plant tends
to be more short and stout.
1284.558 And, for those aficionados out there,
1287.9 I'm sure you know a lot of
the other specific features
1289.88 of sativa versus indica,
1291.32 but already what we're talking
about is the same plant,
1294.38 cannabis, with two very
different morphologies or shapes.
1298.31 You might say, "Well, why is
this interesting or important
1300.087 "to how it affects me
or affects other people
1302.652 "for medicinal or recreational purposes?"
1304.85 Well, it turns out that even
though they are the same plant,
1307.73 these two different genetic varieties,
1309.339 because of the way that they grow
1312.74 and the way they capture sunlight
1314.33 and the way, believe it or
not, that the different plants
1317.191 within that strain
interact with one another,
1319.82 'cause believe it or not,
1320.96 plants are interacting with one another,
1322.97 they actually bring different elements
1324.92 of the psychoactive compounds
to different components
1327.32 within the leaves and the so-called buds.
1330.59 The takeaway is that when consumed,
1332.63 and when I say consumed,
I want to be very clear,
1334.52 I don't necessarily just
mean oral consumption
1337.91 or eating cannabis sativa by edible,
1342.08 I also mean smoking it,
and that could be...
1345.08 people will, just like with tobacco,
1347.78 the way that they bring
the psychoactive components
1350.27 into their bloodstream and
into their brain and body
1352.73 is to essentially heat the dried leaves
1356.3 of the cannabis plant.
1358.64 Then the heat liberates some
of the psychoactive components
1362.75 that when inhaled into the lungs,
1364.61 because the lungs include
a lot of vasculature,
1366.89 a lot of basically blood
vessels and capillaries,
1370.43 that the psychoactive components
1373.73 are actually directly absorbed
1374.99 from the lungs into the bloodstream,
1376.49 and they can cross into the bloodstream
1378.08 and permeate throughout the body
1380.3 and cross the so-called
blood brain barrier.
1382.28 So in other words, burning
the plant liberates the smoke
1386.84 that contains the psychoactive compounds,
1389.69 and those are inhaled into the lungs
1391.55 and then get into the brain and body
1393.17 and act on the brain and body.
1394.61 And the major effect of sativa varieties
1397.25 are to create a high, if you will,
1399.98 and I'm putting this in air quotes
1401.03 for those of you that are listening,
1402.47 but to also act as a stimulant.
1404.48 The sativa varieties tend to make people
1406.31 feel invigorated, somewhat alert.
1409.07 It doesn't tend to be
as much of a sedative
1411.08 as some of the other varieties.
1412.76 Some people report
heightened sense of focus
1415.19 or heightened sense of creativity.
1416.72 We'll talk a little bit later on
1417.92 as to whether or not they actually
1419.27 are achieving heightened
levels of focus and creativity,
1421.79 or whether or not they
just perceive themselves
1423.5 to have heightened levels
of focus and creativity.
1425.327 The sativa varieties tend to make people
1427.91 feel a little bit less susceptible
1430.55 to pain and noxious stimuli,
1432.8 which are basically stimuli
that you don't like.
1435.95 So the sativa varieties are
often prescribed or are used
1441.12 in the recreational context
for pain management and relief.
1445.22 Basically, the sativa variety is known
1447.62 to include a head biased effect.
1450.5 So here, we're talking
about subjective effects,
1452.96 and of course these will vary
1454.22 from one individual to the next.
1456.02 Some people will smoke cannabis sativa
1458.08 or ingest cannabis sativa orally
1461.18 and will feel an entirely
different array of effects,
1464.45 but most people, the majority of people
1466.46 experience a head-centered
high, alertness, focus
1470.288 and a sense that they're more creative.
1473.06 Contrast that with the
indica varieties of cannabis,
1476.33 and when people smoke or eat
or ingest indica varieties,
1480.98 the psychoactive components of indica,
1483.14 and again, this is pure indica,
1484.67 so not hybridized with sativa
at all, but just pure indica,
1487.85 tend to lead to more full-bodied effects.
1491.09 People report feeling more
complete, full-body relaxation,
1495.38 more of a sedative effect.
1497.6 Indica cannabis is often prescribed
1500.48 and/or used recreationally
1502.16 in order to achieve a state of sleep
1504.89 or to help relieve anxiety,
so less of a stimulant effect.
1509.3 And we will talk about why,
1511.04 literally, the underlying neural circuits
1512.538 that lead to the sativa
variety causing more
1516.35 of a elevated mood and a
head high, if you will,
1519.8 and the indica variety as being
more full body relaxation.
1523.04 One of the ways to
remember the distinction
1524.45 between the effects of cannabis
sativa and cannabis indica
1527.6 was relayed to me by a friend
who actually was a chronic,
1530.63 meaning every day, all
day, consumer of marijuana.
1534.83 He basically smoked marijuana for 20 years
1536.72 before quitting about
four or five years ago,
1539.03 and he said that indica
is often referred to
1542.27 as 'in-da-couch,' meaning
laid back in the couch.
1545.9 And that can help you remember
1547.61 that the indica varieties of cannabis
1549.423 do tend to be more
sedative in their effects.
1552.847 Okay, so there's sativa
and there's indica,
1554.57 and then now there are hybrid strains.
1556.79 So marijuana growers and
people who specialize
1560.24 in creating novel varieties
of the cannabis plant,
1563.469 again, I'm using the words
cannabis and marijuana
1565.82 more or less interchangeably here,
1568.04 they are very good at
creating new strains of plant
1572.24 that might be 25% sativa and
75% indica or vice versa,
1577.34 or 50/50 or 90/10.
1579.548 Essentially, what's happening nowadays
1581.66 is that through plant biology,
plant genetics, I should say,
1586.37 growers are getting quite efficient
1589.01 at creating a variety of different strains
1591.59 of the marijuana plant that
give rise to very nuanced
1595.88 and distinct effects on brain and body.
1599.09 In fact, so much so, that
there's now a new nomenclature,
1602.69 a new language emerging around cannabis
1606.56 and the development of
novel strains of cannabis
1608.81 for medicinal and/or
recreational purposes.
1611.81 And while this might
sound a little bit medical
1614.534 or a little bit clinical to
some people, believe it or not,
1618.02 this is the nomenclature
that is now typically used.
1620.54 People still refer to the sativa,
indica and hybrid strains,
1624.292 but there's now also a description
1626.54 of so-called type one, type
two and type three strains
1631.28 for any given sativa,
indica or hybrid strain.
1634.85 Okay, so just to put this
clearly in your mind,
1637.25 you've got sativa varieties,
that is pure sativa varieties.
1640.49 You have indica varieties,
again, pure indica,
1644.45 and then you have hybrid varieties,
1646.82 and beneath each of those,
1648.71 you have type one, type
two and type three strains
1652.699 of indica, sativa or hybrid varieties.
1658.19 What are type one, type
two and type three?
1661.37 Well, type one, type two
and type three strains
1665.009 are strains that have varying amounts
1667.79 or ratios of THC to CBD.
1672.2 So for instance, type one strain,
1674.84 so for instance, you could
have a pure sativa, type one,
1678.17 or a type one pure sativa
or a type one indica.
1681.829 Those are going to have
the greatest amount
1684.26 of THC relative to CBD.
1686.57 And I really want to emphasize this,
1688.28 understanding the ratio of THC to CBD
1691.058 can help explain a lot
or even predict a lot
1694.43 about how a given strain of
cannabis will impact somebody.
1698.81 For instance, because THC
is largely responsible
1702.558 for the typical psychoactive
components of cannabis,
1707.613 so what I mean here is, if
somebody's ingesting sativa,
1711.38 and it routinely makes
them feel more energized,
1714.65 elevates their mood,
1716.48 it gives them a heightened
sense of creativity,
1718.31 if that's what they experience,
1720.35 and they're taking a
type one version of that,
1722.72 that means that it's quite rich
in THC and very little CBD.
1727.241 However, if they were to take
a type one version of sativa,
1731.3 and it feels far too strong,
like too much energy,
1733.61 or they felt like they were
too much in their head,
1735.53 nowadays, there are strains of sativa
1738.793 that have been genetically engineered,
1741.59 and I don't mean by an
engineer tinkering away
1743.75 with gene engineering in
a CRISPR creating mutes,
1748.64 but literally by hybridizing,
1750.05 crossing different plants to one another,
1752.86 creating in a natural context,
1755.15 the same way plants in the outside world
1756.983 would sometimes hybridize to one another,
1760.79 creating a variety
that's perhaps type two,
1763.61 which is going to have
less THC and more CBD,
1768.503 or a type three, which is
going to be very high CBD
1771.56 and very little THC,
1773.45 and the same is also true
for the indica varieties.
1776.069 So I want to make sure that
everyone understands this,
1778.22 because it becomes very important
1779.27 for understanding the biology of cannabis
1781.55 and predicting positive versus
negative effects of cannabis.
1786.425 Sativa has this stimulant-like effect
1789.47 and tends to be more of
a head high, if you will.
1791.63 Indica tends to be more full-body,
1793.28 then lead to more in-da-couch,
as I refer to it before,
1796.923 pun intended, deep relaxation,
reduce insomnia, et cetera.
1801.622 Now, within each of
those sativa and indica,
1803.75 you have type one, type
two and type three,
1805.22 and that has everything
to do with how much THC,
1809.24 which is the dominant
psychoactive compound,
1812.18 versus CBD, which has other
effects, mainly on the body,
1815.99 but not so much on the brain
1818.36 and modes of thinking and mood, et cetera,
1820.1 how much THC versus CBD is present.
1822.23 And again, type one is THC dominant,
1825.14 type two, equal ratios, if
you will, of THC and CBD,
1828.29 and type three tend to be high CBD.
1830.858 Okay, so already we've got
some categorization here
1832.76 that hopefully isn't overwhelming to you,
1834.68 but this turns out to
be extremely important
1837.14 if you want to understand
how cannabis works
1839.166 and predict the effects of cannabis.
1841.4 I'd like to take a quick break
1842.78 and acknowledge one of our
sponsors, Athletic Greens.
1845.81 Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
1847.893 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
1850.67 that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.
1853.55 I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,
1856.25 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
1858.47 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens,
1860.06 and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens,
1862.13 once are usually twice a day,
1864.11 is that it gets to me the probiotics
1866.03 that I need for gut health.
1867.71 Our gut is very important.
1868.82 It's populated by gut microbiota
1871.37 that communicate with the
brain, the immune system,
1873.14 and basically all the
biological systems of our body
1875.54 to strongly impact our
immediate and long-term health,
1878.751 and those probiotics in Athletic Greens
1881.03 are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health.
1884.87 In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number
1886.7 of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals
1888.35 that make sure that all of my foundational
1889.937 and nutritional needs are
met, and it tastes great.
1893.69 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
1895.13 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
1898.163 and they'll give you
five free travel packs
1900.5 that make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens
1902.398 while you're on the road,
1903.68 in the car, on the plane, et cetera,
1905.39 and they'll give you a year's
supply of vitamin D3 K2.
1908.81 Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
1911.48 to get the five free travel packs
1912.86 and the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.
1915.8 Okay, so somewhat surprisingly,
1917.33 we're going to set aside cannabis.
1918.71 We're going to take what we
know about sativa, indica,
1921.26 type one, type two, type
three, CBD, et cetera,
1922.947 and we're just going to set
that aside for a moment.
1925.7 Why would we do that?
1926.533 Well, we have to ask ourselves,
1928.64 why would any of these plants,
1930.53 why would any of these
compounds, THC, CBD,
1933.83 sativa, indica, et cetera,
1935.66 why would any of that have
any effect on us at all?
1939.332 And this discussion
that we're about to have
1941.75 very much resembles the discussion
1943.82 that we had on a previous
episode about nicotine,
1946.55 because as many of you know,
1948.05 nicotine is a commonly used substance.
1950.48 In fact, if we were to look
1951.44 at the three most commonly used drugs,
1954.11 alcohol will be at the top of the list.
1955.64 Many billions of people
regularly use alcohol
1958.55 or occasionally use alcohol.
1960.77 Many billions of people also use nicotine.
1964.25 It's the second most consumed
drug, so more than 1 billion
1968.54 and probably closer to 2
billion people consume nicotine,
1971.12 and then the third most consumed drug
1973.528 is cannabis in one form or another.
1976.58 And many of you are probably shouting,
1978.267 "What about caffeine?
What about caffeine?"
1979.85 Well, in the context of drugs,
1982.22 and in particular, addictive drugs,
1983.6 caffeine doesn't quite rise to the list,
1986.18 but if we were to look at caffeine
1989.18 and include it in that list,
1990.83 caffeine would be above all of those.
1992.63 But the most commonly
used drugs are alcohol,
1994.43 second after that is
nicotine and then cannabis.
1999.56 Nicotine, as some of you may know,
2001.9 if you listen to the episode on nicotine,
2003.37 but even if you didn't,
2005.32 nicotine comes from the tobacco plant,
2007.72 and there are a few other
plants that include nicotine,
2009.64 and typically it's brought
into the brain and body
2012.148 by smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco,
2014.29 snuffing tobacco or vaping nicotine.
2019.39 Nicotine exists in the outside world
2021.01 in these plants, the tobacco plants,
2022.84 but the reason it has
an effect on the body
2024.67 is that there are so-called
nicotinic receptors in the body.
2027.7 Now, those nicotinic receptors
were named after nicotine,
2030.37 the compound, but they
existed in the brain and body,
2032.934 not because of the existence
of a tobacco plant,
2036.01 but because there are
other chemicals in the body
2039.13 that naturally occur, namely acetylcholine
2042.01 that bind the nicotine receptor.
2045.07 Those chemicals, such as acetylcholine,
2047.35 that bind the nicotinic
receptor in your brain and body
2049.748 create an enhanced sense of
focus, et cetera, et cetera.
2052.883 But, nicotine from tobacco
binds that same receptor,
2058.631 but with much greater affinity,
2060.7 and therefore also
creates a state of focus,
2063.61 but a much greater one than we
can achieve without nicotine.
2066.844 So you can see the nicotine episode
2068.53 if you want to learn more about that.
2071.16 In a very similar way, all
of our brains and bodies,
2075.58 from the time that we are
conceived, believe it or not,
2078.82 very shortly after conception,
if we want to be accurate,
2081.417 very early conception,
when you were in the womb,
2084.746 and still now, if you're
listening to this,
2087.07 you have what are called
cannabinoid receptors,
2091.84 because you also have
endogenous cannabinoids.
2095.593 What do we mean by that?
2096.67 You have receptors, which
are like little parking spots
2099.49 that are present on cells
in your brain and body,
2103.36 and what we call a ligand,
2105.73 which is basically just a
chemical that's released,
2107.62 parks in that receptor
2109.75 and causes a number of
different biological effects.
2114.58 Cannabis contains compounds
2117.37 that also bind to those receptors,
2119.53 but here I want to make a
really clear distinction.
2121.45 We have what are called
endogenous ligands,
2123.7 those just mean chemicals from within us
2126.28 that we make naturally,
2127.42 even if we never go
near the cannabis plant
2129.4 or any other source of cannabis,
2131.17 we have chemicals that are created in us
2134.23 that park in those receptors
and cause biological effects
2138.34 on mood, on perception,
on the immune system,
2140.35 on hunger, et cetera,
2141.67 again, without ever going
anywhere near cannabis,
2144.43 we have these endogenous cannabinoids.
2147.07 So endogenous cannabinoids
are floating around in us,
2149.71 or I should say, they are released in us
2151.27 in particular ways,
bind to these receptors
2153.1 and cause changes in
mood, appetite, et cetera.
2155.8 They have many different
effects on the brain and body,
2157.127 and we'll talk about those.
2159.7 But just like with nicotine,
2161.26 there are substances in the outside world,
2163.33 in this case, cannabis
contains these substances,
2166.84 so things like THC and like
CBD, that when ingested
2172.66 by smoking or vaping
or by ingesting edibles
2176.226 also will park in those same receptors,
2180.19 the cannabinoid receptors and
lead to biological effects.
2184.39 Now, it's a little bit misleading,
2185.62 because we call them cannabinoid receptors
2187.51 as if they were there to bind cannabis,
2191.4 or just like we call
the nicotine receptors,
2193.57 nicotinic receptors, it makes
it seem as if they were there
2196.93 in order to bind nicotine from tobacco,
2200.35 but that's not the way our
brains and bodies evolved.
2202.6 Our brains and bodies
evolved for these receptors
2205.63 to make use of chemicals
that exist within us,
2208.6 called again, endogenous chemicals,
2211.51 and those endogenous chemicals
lead to certain effects,
2214.24 as I mentioned before.
2215.47 The key thing here,
2216.64 if you haven't understood
anything I've set up until now,
2218.741 please understand this, the key thing is
2222.37 that THC and CBD and the
other components of cannabis
2226.78 bind to those receptors,
2228.46 those endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
2230.71 the ones that we naturally
make, with much greater affinity
2234.97 and exert a vastly
greater potency and effect
2238.63 on mood and perception, et cetera,
2240.85 than do our endogenous cannabinoids.
2245.47 Another analogy that one could take
2246.79 in order to understand this
2248.32 would be hormones, like
testosterone and estrogen.
2251.83 Many people, I would say all people,
2255.07 make testosterone and
estrogen to varying degrees.
2257.62 It's going to depend on whether
or not you're male, female,
2259.33 your age, whether or not
you've gone through puberty,
2260.86 et cetera, et cetera,
2262.27 but let's just take
testosterone for example.
2265.39 There's testosterone
circulating in your body.
2268.99 That's true if you're male or female,
2270.82 and there are receptors
called androgen receptors,
2273.1 we could even call them
testosterone receptors.
2276.1 And the testosterone
binds to those receptors
2278.23 and has effects on cells.
2279.37 It causes hair growth, changes the voice.
2281.71 It can affect libido.
2282.97 It affects all sorts of
things in the brain and body,
2284.68 depending on which organ and
tissue you're talking about.
2287.77 But of course,
2288.88 there are people that take
synthetic testosterone
2291.1 or derivatives of testosterone,
2294.04 and some of those derivatives,
2295.18 for instance, in the
body building community
2296.74 and the sports community,
2297.64 they will take things like Dianabol.
2299.32 These are modified
versions of testosterone
2303.19 that can bind to the testosterone receptor
2306.16 with much greater affinity,
2308.14 or I should say the androgen receptor
2309.85 with much greater affinity,
2311.08 and have supra physiological effects,
2314.11 effects that would
essentially never be seen
2316.93 from testosterone that was endogenously,
2321.483 excuse me, endogenously
released within the body.
2325.66 We could say the same thing for estrogen.
2327.31 There are estrogen receptors,
they bind estrogen,
2331.87 but if someone were to
take synthetic estrogen
2334.3 or to ingest a plant compound
2335.89 that contains various
estrogenic compounds,
2337.867 and those plants
certainly exist out there,
2340.72 they can have supra physiological effects
2343.27 on those receptors.
2344.83 Why am I telling you this?
2346.12 Well, many people believe
that because cannabis,
2350.08 marijuana is a plant, and
plants grow out of the ground,
2354.13 and they're naturally occurring,
2356.14 and because we have receptors in our body
2359.38 that are there without
the need to engineer them
2363.07 from some external source,
they're in our genome.
2366.07 They're program for it, and
we're born with these things,
2367.72 and we keep these our entire life.
2370.12 Many people mistakenly think,
ah, these plant compounds
2374.56 are safer for us or better for us,
2376.6 or are somehow appropriate
for us to ingest,
2379.528 but that's simply not true,
and here, I'm not saying
2382.6 that cannabis is always
a bad idea for people.
2384.76 There are certain populations
and certain people
2386.5 for which it can be relatively
safe recreationally,
2389.53 that's the truth, and
there are other populations
2391.51 for which it can be downright dangerous,
2393.49 recreationally or medicinally.
2395.92 And of course, there
are medicinal purposes
2397.42 that are being explored, and
we'll talk more about that.
2399.64 But this is vital to understand,
2401.17 because I think that when we hear,
2402.527 "Oh, it's from a plant, it's natural,"
2404.71 and then you also have
a receptor for these,
2406.24 endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
2408.07 and therefore, the marriage of those two,
2411.52 the coming together of the
chemical THC or CBD or both
2415.39 with these receptors is
somehow supposed to happen
2418.3 as if this was a purpose
of having these receptors,
2421.48 but it's simply not the case.
2422.61 In the same way that
the nicotinic receptors
2424.84 are not there because
nicotine is good for us,
2427.39 they're there because there are compounds
2428.68 that exist within us that are good
2430.96 to bind to those receptors
from time to time.
2434.2 Now, here's the key thing about,
2436.27 I guess today, I'm saying
there are a lot of key things,
2437.8 but here's another key thing
about understanding cannabis
2441.07 and the way that it works,
which is that THC and CBD,
2445.78 when they're brought
into the brain and body
2447.64 by smoking or edible, et cetera,
2452.17 they bind to those receptors,
2453.97 those endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
2456.37 and they tap into the same systems
2458.5 that your endogenous
cannabinoids would tap into,
2461.86 the ones that affect mood and energy
2463.42 and creativity and relaxation, et cetera,
2465.91 but they do so with thousand
fold greater potency.
2471.13 And as a consequence of that,
2473.29 your endogenous cannabinoids
are outcompeted.
2476.86 They really get no opportunity
2478.63 to interact with those receptors.
2480.76 And understanding that,
2482.71 can lead to a very clear
understanding of why, for instance,
2485.62 when people use cannabis
to relieve anxiety,
2488.8 or they use cannabis to
enter a certain brain state
2491.17 for creativity or to enter sleep,
2493.66 why a dependence on
cannabis starts to emerge.
2497.11 Because if they don't ingest cannabis,
2499.57 and again, ingest could
mean smoke to bring THC in,
2502.77 or CBD in, or ingest
orally or even transdermal
2506.2 or tincture or one of the other varieties,
2508.103 if they don't do that,
then what happens is
2511.708 not only are the receptors not
stimulated to the same degree
2515.53 or with the same potency
that they normally are,
2519.1 but the endogenous cannabinoids
2521.2 can no longer have their effect,
2522.67 so people experience
heightened levels of anxiety,
2525.19 disrupted mood, disrupted
brain state, and so on.
2529.9 Now, again, I want to be very clear
2531.94 that I'm not trying to
paint a picture of cannabis
2534.01 as all bad or even partially bad.
2536.17 What I want to do today is give you
2537.49 as much information I can
as to how cannabis works,
2541.48 how its different component parts work,
2543.07 how the different types of cannabis work,
2544.72 and point to some of
the valid medicinal uses
2548.201 and some of the recreational uses,
2550.24 and then lay out the landscape for you
2552.96 as to who is really most at risk
2554.761 in terms of psychoactive components,
2558.43 immune components and so on and so forth,
2560.68 so that you can make the
most informed choice for you.
2562.57 I am not here to tell you
what to do or what not to do.
2565.607 As I like to say, do as you wish,
2568.829 I mean, don't do as you wish
2571.27 if it harms other people or yourself,
2572.5 but do as you wish, but
know what you're doing,
2575.05 so that's really my goal here.
2576.55 So as we begin to dive
further into the biology,
2578.62 I think you'll start to
get a clearer picture
2579.89 of why cannabis is so
effective in some context,
2583.78 but also why it can create
such massive suffering
2587.77 in other contexts because of the way
2590.29 that it out-competes your own natural
2592.27 endogenous cannabinoid systems.
2594.066 So let's talk about those
endogenous cannabinoid systems,
2596.8 what they are and how they work,
2598.69 because that will give us a lens
2600.43 into what the higher
potency or maximum impact
2604.69 of the various cannabis
plant varieties and strains
2606.567 in THC and CBD and so forth,
how and why those work.
2611.02 So what are the endogenous cannabinoids,
2613.03 these chemical substances
that everybody makes?
2616.87 You make them, I make them.
2618.43 You've been making them basically
2620.05 from the time that you were conceived,
2621.22 and you are going to make them
until the time that you die.
2623.92 Whether or not they have the impact
2625.54 and the biological functions
that I'm about to describe
2627.67 will depend a lot on whether or not
2629.59 you are using your own
endogenous cannabinoids
2632.642 to park in those receptors
that you also have
2635.86 from birth until death,
2637.648 or whether or not you are
tickling those receptors
2641.8 or strongly activating those receptors
2644.41 using some external source like
cannabis and THC, et cetera.
2651.4 The two main endogenous cannabinoids
2654.07 that we want to consider are anandamide,
2656.71 which we will refer to
as EAE, so anandamide,
2660.37 and another one, which
is arachidonoyl-glycerol,
2664.72 arachidonoyl-glycerol, which
we will abbreviate 2-AG.
2668.17 So let's just take EAE and
2-AG, lump them together
2672.76 and talk about the
endogenous cannabinoids,
2674.8 just to make it simple.
2675.91 But if you want to do the
deep dive on anadamide
2678.28 versus 2-AG, please be my guest.
2682.72 The endogenous cannabinoids
are released from neurons.
2686.02 What are neurons? Neurons are nerve cells.
2688.63 And nerve cells should be
conceptualized like this.
2691.96 You have presynaptic neurons
and postsynaptic neurons.
2694.99 Presynaptic neurons basically
contain little vesicles,
2697.78 little bubbles full of neurotransmitter,
2700.84 which are chemicals,
2702.07 and when neurons are
stimulated electrically,
2705.16 and that could be from a thought,
2706.6 it could be from the desire to move,
2708.88 it could be because of a drug,
2710.74 it could be because you're hungry,
2713.044 the relevant neurons will vomit
out or will fuse, as we say,
2718.3 those little packets, those little bubbles
2720.64 of neurotransmitter into the gap
2722.77 between the pre and postsynaptic neuron,
2723.667 and we call that a synaptic
cleft or the synapse.
2726.58 It's a little gap, a little space,
2727.93 and the neurotransmitter
flows across that synapse,
2730.81 and some of it will park
in the little parking spots
2733.51 that we call receptors on
the postsynaptic neuron side.
2736.51 Depending on which neurotransmitter it is,
2738.43 and a bunch of other things
not worth going into right now,
2742.27 the parking of that chemical
2743.44 and those neurotransmitter receptors
2744.85 will either cause that neuron
on the postsynaptic side
2748.93 to itself, release
neurotransmitter elsewhere,
2752.39 or it will quiet it down,
2754.69 so-called excitation and inhibition.
2756.43 That's kind of neuro
transmission in a nutshell.
2758.59 If you don't understand it, no big deal.
2760.24 It's not going to prevent you
2761.17 from understanding today's discussion.
2762.43 If you understand even a small fraction
2764.41 of what I've just said,
2765.79 then it's going to allow you to understand
2768.7 not just today's discussion,
but a lot of neuroscience
2770.508 with a lot more nuance and
depth of understanding.
2775.21 The key thing to know about
the endogenous cannabinoids
2778.96 is that unlike most neurotransmitters,
2782.56 they are released from
the postsynaptic side.
2785.74 So what happens is neurotransmitter goes
2788.23 from presynaptic neuron
to postsynaptic neuron,
2791.17 but under certain conditions,
2793.03 the postsynaptic neuron,
itself, releases a chemical,
2796.51 and that chemical goes backward,
what we call retrogradely,
2799.037 to the presynaptic neuron,
binds to receptors there
2803.02 and changes the probability
that the presynaptic neuron
2806.182 will release neurotransmitter.
2809.341 Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids
2812.5 tend to decrease the probability
2815.2 that a neuron will
release neurotransmitter.
2819.04 They're a break on the system.
2820.81 They're a way of shutting
down the communication
2824.05 between neurons, regulating it,
2826.15 not to make it completely quiet,
2827.53 but to adjust the levels
with a lot of nuance.
2830.71 Now, the other thing that the
endogenous cannabinoids do
2833.62 is a mind bender, because
we're talking about cannabis,
2837.34 and a commonly known feature
2839.65 of cannabis and marijuana consumption
2842.02 is disruptions in short-term memory,
2844.06 and there is essentially zero debate
2846.25 as to whether or not that occurs,
2847.57 and we'll talk about the
mechanisms a little bit later.
2849.82 And yet, endogenous cannabinoids,
2853.359 the chemicals that you naturally release
2855.34 from these postsynaptic neurons
2856.75 that travel retrogradely back
to the presynaptic neuron,
2859.759 actually can lead to
strengthening of connections
2863.86 between the presynaptic neuron
and the postsynaptic neuron
2867.31 through a process called
long-term potentiation, or LTP.
2871.63 They can also cause
2872.92 what's called depression of communication
2876.25 between a presynaptic neuron
and a postsynaptic neuron.
2880.3 Long-term depression has nothing to do
2883.63 with depression as a psychological
state or as a illness.
2888.431 Long-term potentiation
and long-term depression
2891.1 simply refer to the probability
2892.96 that one neuron will be able
2894.64 to stimulate and activate another neuron.
2897.28 And, as I just told you,
2899.237 the endogenous cannabinoids
can either turn up the dial
2903.25 or turn down the dial.
2904.45 They can either increase the probability
2906.37 or decrease the probability
2908.11 that a given connection between neurons
2910.6 will function more or will function less.
2913.36 So if you think about the
communication between neurons
2915.1 as crosstalk, as a conversation,
2917.89 well, the endogenous cannabinoids
can dictate whether or not
2922.0 that conversation is likely
to occur or not to occur.
2924.7 Think of them as either putting someone
2927.4 at the top of your text
chain in your phone,
2929.979 which would be long-term potentiation,
2932.5 or essentially blocking their number,
2935.14 which would essentially
be long-term depression.
2938.74 So, if you're getting the impression
2940.9 that the endogenous cannabinoids
2942.28 are working in a number of different ways,
2944.2 and it's not very
straightforward, you're right.
2946.27 In fact, that's the message
that I'd like you to take away.
2948.49 The endogenous cannabinoids
2950.29 are sometimes increasing
neuronal communication.
2952.45 This can lead to increases in mood
2954.46 or increases in the likelihood
2956.38 that someone will talk a certain way
2958.42 or behave a certain way
or feel a certain way.
2960.523 That can also lead to decreases
in synaptic transmission,
2964.24 that is communication between neurons,
2965.8 in ways that will make
somebody's mood lower,
2969.19 or will make them less
hungry or more hungry.
2972.4 And, here's the really key thing,
2975.01 there are two kinds of
endogenous cannabinoid receptors,
2978.28 referred to as CB1 and CB2,
2980.98 and we can say with confidence that CB1
2984.67 is highly enriched in the nervous system,
2986.68 and especially within the brain.
2988.18 It's found not everywhere,
2989.53 but almost everywhere in the brain
2991.12 and elsewhere in the nervous system,
2992.2 so spinal cord and other
aspects of the nervous system.
2995.98 CB2, the cannabinoid receptor, CB2
3000.27 is largely located in
the tissues of the body,
3002.55 including the immune system, the liver,
3004.165 even the genitals, et cetera.
3007.08 So what this means is that
the endogenous cannabinoids
3009.413 are having these sorts of effects
3011.4 on neurons that I talked about,
3012.66 but they are also having
effects on immune cells,
3015.69 on reproductive organs, on liver,
3017.64 on digestion, on hunger, et cetera,
3019.71 through mechanisms that are divorced
3022.05 from the function of the
nervous system of neurons.
3024.93 Now, in reality, no system
of the brain and body
3026.91 is divorced from the nervous system,
3028.11 because the nervous system
is controlling everything.
3030.36 It is really the master controller,
3031.68 and everything's feeding
back to the nervous system,
3033.48 so it's a two way street.
3034.92 But the simple way to think
about it is CB1 receptors
3037.819 are mainly in the nervous system,
3039.927 and CB2 receptors are mainly in the body
3042.36 and endogenous cannabinoids,
again, EAE, anandamide,
3047.378 and 2-AG, arachidonoyl-glycerol,
3050.58 are impacting CB1 and CB2 receptors.
3053.49 Today we're mainly going to
talk about CB1 receptors,
3055.307 'cause they are the ones
that are responsible
3057.27 for most of the familiar
effects of cannabis,
3059.82 but the key takeaway at this
point is to really understand
3064.29 that the major effects of
your endogenous cannabinoids
3067.74 on these receptors in this
particular CB1 are very nuanced.
3072.24 It depends on context,
depends on which neurons.
3074.28 It's sometimes increasing
communication between neurons,
3077.04 sometimes decreasing it, and
then along comes cannabis,
3081.27 and that cannabis, again,
3083.07 can arrive by smoking,
by vaping, by edible.
3086.376 And cannabis contains THC and CBD
3089.758 that potently bind the CB1 receptor,
3094.74 and now the effects of the CB1 receptor
3097.62 being occupied by THC or
being occupied by CBD,
3103.199 are not very nuanced.
3104.88 In fact, they are very predictable
3107.55 and especially important is to understand
3110.16 that they are so strong, and
they park in that receptor
3113.28 with such affinity, with
such force and precision
3116.58 and stubbornness and refusal
to leave that receptor
3120.15 that they completely outcompete
3122.04 the endogenous cannabinoid system.
3124.14 In fact, they leave the
endogenous cannabinoid system
3126.48 essentially dysfunctional,
which, in some cases,
3130.05 may be a good thing, but in most cases,
3132.6 is going to lead to
problems of various kinds,
3135.12 and we'll talk about
what sorts of problems.
3136.56 And again, I feel obligated to say,
3138.511 this is not me saying don't
ingest cannabis or THC or CBD.
3143.25 That's not what I'm saying.
3144.42 What I'm saying is if
you evaluate the potency
3147.528 that is in technical terms,
3149.49 it would be the affinity
with which these compounds,
3152.58 THC and CBD and CBN, bind to
these endogenous receptors,
3157.26 that would be like a howitzer
gun, like a cannon going off,
3160.74 as compared to endogenous cannabinoid,
3164.04 whether or not it's EAE or 2-AG,
3166.62 which is more like a cap
gun level of activation,
3169.74 at least in this analogy.
3171.0 So now you have what at
least I would like to think
3173.096 is a fairly complete understanding
3175.68 of the different varieties of cannabis,
3177.81 at least at a broad sweep,
3179.962 and the different biological
effects that they can have,
3183.12 at least in terms of the major receptors
3184.92 and in retrograde signaling,
et cetera, et cetera.
3187.98 Now, let's take a step
back into the real world
3190.53 and evaluate or think about
3192.54 what happens when somebody smokes cannabis
3195.889 or ingests cannabis by way of edible
3198.72 or tincture or something of that sort.
3202.29 Cannabis is very fast to
enter the bloodstream.
3206.472 In fact, within 30 seconds,
it's going to enter the brain
3210.09 and permeate throughout
the brain and body.
3212.37 That's very, very fast.
3213.75 I mean, when you contrast that
3214.8 with something like
alcohol or even nicotine,
3217.32 depending on how the
nicotine is delivered,
3219.18 that is a very fast
delivery of the psychoactive
3222.6 and biologically active compound,
3224.4 which in this case is THC and CBD
3226.347 and probably some other things as well.
3228.81 So within 30 seconds,
3229.95 it reaches the brain and bodily tissues,
3232.95 and within 30 to 60 minutes,
3236.19 it's going to reach
its peak concentrations
3238.342 and have its peak biological effects.
3240.96 Those aren't always the same thing,
3241.98 but in the case of cannabis,
3243.42 again here I'm using
cannabis as an umbrella term
3246.259 for THC and CBD, the
effects are going to peak
3248.85 at about 30 to 60 minutes
after bringing those compounds
3252.6 into the body in some way or another.
3255.06 And the effects tend to last
3256.41 anywhere from three to four hours,
3258.03 although there's some variation on that,
3259.77 depending on individual metabolism,
3261.9 whether or not somebody is
familiar with the compound,
3266.4 believe it or not,
psychologically familiar,
3267.84 but also biologically familiar,
3269.52 or whether or not it's a first time use
3270.84 or occasional use and so on.
3273.746 THC and CBD and other
components of cannabis
3277.71 are highly what we call lipophilic.
3279.6 That is, they have an affinity toward,
3282.39 and they can actually pass
through fatty tissues.
3284.203 Now, every cell in your
body, but especially neurons,
3287.1 have a double layer of
fat on their outside.
3289.917 And of course, when people hear "fat,"
3291.84 they always think, ooh, fat's bad.
3294.15 Most of the world seems to
want to lose fat or bodily fat.
3297.06 Here we're talking about
the fatty membrane,
3299.85 the barrier around each tissue,
3301.65 in this case we're talking
particularly about neurons.
3304.41 And THC and CBD and the
other components of cannabis
3308.79 are highly lipophilic,
so they can get into
3311.04 essentially all cells just
simply by flowing into them.
3313.74 They will also remain in
those cells for a long time.
3317.04 So, I know that a number of people,
3319.35 depending on whether
or not they get tested
3321.42 for work or for sport or otherwise
3323.52 for cannabis or CBD and THC,
3327.24 don't take this as a strict number,
3329.01 but typically, if one ingests CBD or THC,
3334.02 smokes cannabis, ingests
by orally, et cetera,
3336.96 doesn't matter, it's going
to stay in that fatty tissue
3339.6 and can be detected for at
least as long as 80 days
3342.99 after ingestion, and
there's a whole industry
3344.85 as to how to accelerate the clearance,
3347.91 and I should just tell you
that just losing bodily fat
3351.3 isn't going to eliminate
it from your system,
3354.008 maybe partially in those fat cells,
3356.46 but certainly intravisceral
fat and other fatty tissue
3360.45 that's in around the brain and body
3362.4 is going to harbor that THC
molecule and the CBD molecule
3366.72 for quite a long while, at least 80 days.
3369.3 So, if someone smokes cannabis
or they ingest cannabis,
3373.5 it very rapidly gets into the bloodstream,
3376.44 and the components that are psychoactive
3378.21 get into the bloodstream
3379.26 and are immediately able to
access neurons and other cells
3383.61 and start having these effects
3384.63 of parking at those endogenous
cannabinoid receptors
3387.24 and impacting the
signaling between neurons,
3389.52 which leads to the subjective
effects of cannabis,
3394.02 including THC and CBDs,
so let's talk about
3395.97 what those different
subjective effects are.
3398.55 Again, this is going to vary
depending on whether or not
3400.53 people are ingesting sativa
varieties of cannabis,
3404.307 just to remind you, those
tend to be elevated mood,
3407.55 alertness, talkativeness.
3409.02 People who take sativa varieties
tend to talk a lot more
3411.75 than they would otherwise.
3413.43 Again, there are exceptions to this,
3414.84 of course there are exceptions.
3416.07 I'm sure there are people
out there shouting,
3417.42 although I guess if
you're the quiet people
3418.65 who don't talk too much,
you're probably not shouting,
3420.32 or if you're not, you're
not doing on sativa,
3422.94 Joe contended, but in any
event, there are exceptions,
3425.97 but there are also general rules.
3427.77 And the sativas tend to
make people's mood elevated,
3430.11 energetic, again, this sort of head high,
3433.08 and indica varieties
tend to do the opposite.
3436.53 more of a sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
3439.92 Why and how would they do that?
3441.93 Well, without going into
an extensive deep dive
3444.33 into the different
neurotransmitter systems
3445.7 of the brain and body,
what we know for sure
3448.65 is that CB1 receptors are present
3451.29 on an enormous number of different neurons
3453.09 in brain structures in neural circuits,
3455.37 so that the sativa varieties
that act as a stimulant,
3459.78 making people feel happy,
3462.87 'cause in general, they
do tend to elevate mood,
3465.45 at least at certain dosages, talkative,
3469.14 tend to make people feel
like they have ideas
3471.96 that are interesting, that
they might want to share,
3474.54 tend to narrow their context,
so we tend to increase focus.
3477.27 This is something that's not
often discussed about cannabis,
3479.46 but especially the sativa varieties
3481.32 can increase people's level
of focus to particular things,
3484.41 something they're watching
or something they're doing
3486.3 or music, it allows them to
narrow their sense of focus.
3490.26 That's going to occur by
activation of CB1 receptors
3493.44 in the so-called prefrontal cortex,
3494.94 which is just behind the forehead,
3496.59 and the prefrontal cortex
acts as a strong modulator
3499.89 of so-called limbic
circuitry and other circuitry
3502.62 that is more stress oriented.
3504.6 The way to think about the
stress and limbic circuitry,
3507.99 such as the amygdala, which
many people have heard about,
3509.963 is that they aren't really
circuits for fear and stress.
3512.728 They are circuits that
are constantly evaluating
3515.4 one's own internal state,
heart rate, et cetera,
3518.28 and what's happening
externally, and, sorry to say,
3521.79 but the default of those
systems is to detect danger,
3524.85 so threat detection systems.
3526.38 And then the prefrontal
cortex largely acts
3528.54 as a brake on those systems,
3530.34 so like the reins pulling
back on a steed of horses
3533.19 that would otherwise just take off.
3535.5 And so, the sativa varieties
tend to increase CB1 activation
3539.31 in the prefrontal cortex
and in other circuitry
3542.13 that then leads to an
overall reduction in stress,
3545.25 because of the way that
prefrontal circuitry
3546.72 can reduce activation or the amygdala.
3549.27 Now that, of course, does not explain
3551.58 why some people become very
stressed and very paranoid
3554.55 when they smoke sativa varieties
3556.2 or other varieties of cannabis
3557.97 or ingest other varieties of cannabis.
3559.65 We'll talk about the paranoid
effect and why that occurs
3562.56 and who might predict
that would occur to them
3565.23 in a little bit.
3566.76 But I just want to give you a
sense of how this is working,
3568.95 because as I mentioned before,
3571.35 THC and/or CBD are going
to bind that CB1 receptor,
3574.92 let's say in prefrontal cortex,
3575.847 the neurons of the prefrontal
cortex, it's going to bind there,
3578.4 and then they'll be a retrograde signaling
3580.35 back to the presynaptic neuron,
3581.337 and in the case of prefrontal cortex,
3583.47 what's happening is it's
increasing transmission,
3586.47 increasing the release of neurotransmitter
3588.15 in the prefrontal cortex.
3589.74 However, at the same time,
3593.07 the very same THC and CBD that
was brought into the system
3596.52 is binding the very same type
of receptors, CB1 receptors,
3600.12 in other brain structures,
such as the amygdala
3603.3 and causing retrograde signaling
3605.82 back to the presynaptic
neurons in the amygdala,
3609.18 but it's quieting the
activation of those neurons,
3612.886 so this is interesting.
3614.49 We have the same
compounds, THC and/or CBD,
3618.24 brought into the body and brain,
3620.91 binding the same receptors, in
this case the CB1 receptors,
3625.23 but depending on where
those receptors are located
3628.47 and which brain areas we're referring to,
3631.11 they are either causing
heightened levels of alertness
3636.24 and activation of
systems that are designed
3638.58 to make you talkative and
alertness and mood, et cetera,
3641.07 focus, or they're causing
suppression of those circuitries.
3645.72 So we have kind of a seesaw effect here
3647.73 where the same compound is
increasing mood and alertness
3649.92 and focus in the prefrontal cortex
3651.27 and is decreasing stress
and threat detection
3654.54 in the amygdala, and that's
one of the reasons why,
3657.42 especially the sativa
varieties of cannabis,
3660.36 allow people to enter
these states of focus,
3662.82 some might even say flow,
although I don't want to go
3665.61 into what flow states really are.
3667.38 That's for a different discussion,
3669.21 and it's very poorly defined as it is.
3672.63 And I certainly don't want
to give people the impression
3674.4 that cannabis increases flow states,
3676.08 because that's not always the case,
3678.66 and certainly most often is
not going to be the case.
3681.06 But the idea here is that this
molecule comes into our brain
3684.54 and is shifting everything
towards a state of focus,
3687.72 elevated mood of heightened
sense of importance
3690.96 about whatever it is that
we happen to be doing.
3692.82 And now of course, whatever
we could happen to be doing
3695.43 could be writing a song, writing poetry,
3699.24 communicating with somebody,
3700.56 but it could also be something as trivial
3702.3 as watching cartoons or watching a movie,
3705.87 which is not trivial in its own right,
3708.12 but in terms of thinking
about the creative aspects
3710.91 or the creativity stimulating
aspects of cannabis,
3714.24 not productivity oriented.
3717.03 So narrowed focus, elevated mood,
3719.07 more relaxed and yet energetic,
3721.23 that's the major effects
of the sativa varieties,
3724.17 except, and this is a really big boldface,
3727.05 triple underlined 'except,'
3728.91 except in some individuals,
depending on dosage,
3732.36 but also depending on
preexisting neural circuitry
3736.41 and propensity for anxiety,
3738.27 some people ingest or
smoke sativa varieties,
3742.17 and regardless of whether
or not it's a type one,
3743.94 type two or type three variety,
3745.98 regardless of the ratio
between THC and CBD,
3749.16 people will experience
intense anxiety and paranoia.
3753.93 Now, how do you predict
3755.64 who will experience intense
anxiety and paranoia
3758.22 and who will experience
intense relaxation, focus
3761.7 and sense of creativity from ingesting
3764.73 or smoking a type one, type
two or type three sativa?
3767.94 Well, there is no way to predict that,
3770.55 and there's a lot of what
I would call street lore
3773.01 or dorm room lore or not peer reviewed,
3777.9 but peer discussed
among friends and people
3782.13 and acquaintances lore out
there that what one needs to do
3785.85 is simply smoke more, or just ingest more.
3788.64 You hear that, "Oh, well listen,
if it makes you paranoid,
3790.987 "you simply need to use more,"
3792.36 that is absolutely categorically false.
3794.85 Everything we know about the
way that THC and CBD work
3798.21 is that they tend to potentiate,
3800.07 that is increase the effects
of these different systems
3805.53 at given synapses and in different areas
3807.3 of the brain and body.
3808.133 That is, if someone
experiences paranoia or anxiety
3812.91 from a given strain of the marijuana plant
3817.14 or from ingesting an
edible in a particular way
3819.033 or a particular kind of edible,
3821.7 that person is very likely
to experience the same effect
3824.85 every time they ingest
that strain or variety.
3828.63 This is part of what's led
to this enormous industry.
3832.08 I mean, there are a number
of different reasons,
3833.1 but this is part of what's
led to this enormous industry
3835.26 of highly customized cannabis
3838.56 where people will spend some time
3840.27 really seeking out the
different strains of cannabis
3842.73 and hybrids of cannabis
that work best for them
3846.329 and work best for them
in particular context.
3849.69 I wish I could tell you
that if you are a person
3852.84 who is between 5' 7" and 6' tall,
3856.32 and you have blue eyes or brown eyes,
3859.44 that the sativa varieties are
going to be right for you,
3861.81 or that sativa varieties are
going to give you panic attacks,
3864.45 I can't do that.
3865.47 The only way to determine it would be
3867.18 to actually experience ingesting
those or smoking those,
3870.18 which is certainly also
not what I'm suggesting.
3872.46 That's up to you.
3873.293 I'm not telling you what
to do or what not to do,
3875.22 but there are no good predictors.
3876.99 In fact, if you look in the literature,
3879.96 it is not at all clear that people
3881.55 who have a heightened level of anxiety
3884.151 when they do not smoke cannabis
3887.04 will experience cannabis
3889.89 as less paranoia inducing
or more relaxing.
3893.25 That's simply not the case.
3895.23 Now, what we can say for sure
3897.93 is that general categories of effects,
3900.81 such as increased focus
and reduced anxiety
3903.63 are largely due to activation of areas
3905.46 like the prefrontal cortex.
3906.99 Now, unlike other compounds
like nicotine or alcohol
3910.2 or neurotransmitter systems like dopamine,
3912.18 when we talk about the cannabinoid system,
3914.52 and I say effects, biological
effects, psychoactive effects,
3918.99 I want you to keep in mind always,
3920.91 please, please, please keep in mind
3922.89 that those effects can be varied
3925.53 and often opposite in direction,
3928.71 so let's just give an example of that.
3930.9 I just mentioned that when
people smoke or or eat sativa,
3934.8 that it tends to lead to one specific set,
3937.145 or generally leads to one
specific set of effects,
3940.59 heightened focus, mood, et cetera.
3941.97 Whereas when they ingest or
smoke indica and its components,
3947.34 again, we're still
talking about THC and CBD
3949.89 in varying ratios, but now
indica cannabis, and you say,
3954.457 "Well, why would it improve
the transition time to sleep?"
3958.2 Or at least give people the impression
3959.52 that it improves the
transition time to sleep.
3961.05 We'll talk about what indica actually does
3962.61 for sleep in a little bit,
3964.47 but indica also tends
to suppress activation
3967.22 of the amygdala and threat
detection centers in the brain,
3969.63 again, binding the same CB1 receptors
3971.61 in those retrograde signaling mechanisms
3973.719 that I talked about before,
3975.15 but it also tends to shut
down the hippocampus,
3978.36 an area of the brain
associated with memory,
3981.75 which is why indica
varieties lead to pronounced,
3986.1 or I should say profound
defects in short-term memory
3989.43 and sometimes in long-term memory as well,
3991.05 if it's consumed over
long periods of time.
3993.93 We'll talk about short, medium
and long-term consumption,
3996.3 occasional consumption going forward.
3998.04 So what I'd like you to take away
3999.09 from this component of the
discussion is first of all,
4002.69 the mechanism of action
4003.95 by which cannabis impacts
the brain and body,
4007.896 but in particular the brain,
4009.32 is going to be through CB1 receptors,
4010.607 and those CB1 receptors can
lead to either an acceleration
4014.24 or a brake on particular
biological mechanisms.
4016.73 And there are going to be a constellation
4019.64 of different accelerations and braking
4022.01 of different neural systems
in the brain and body,
4025.19 depending on whether or
not people ingest sativa
4027.95 or indica or some hybrid strain.
4030.084 And perhaps most importantly,
4031.91 even if you didn't understand anything
4032.743 that I've said about the biology
4034.49 of these different
strains in the receptors,
4036.44 please do understand that
there is no way to predict
4040.4 what the effect of a given
strain will be on an individual.
4044.39 There has been extensive exploration
4046.76 as to whether or not people
who are so called mellower
4049.37 or more anxious or any number
4052.31 of different personality dimensions
4054.68 will respond in one way or the other,
4056.15 but, in fact, there is no way to tell.
4058.61 Layer on top of that the
fact that dosing THC and CBD
4063.26 can be fairly straightforward
in the form of edibles,
4066.35 because there can be, at least
if it's a controlled source,
4069.934 a defined number of milligrams of THC,
4073.58 a defined number of milligrams of CBD.
4076.01 That's true for ingestibles.
4077.96 It's much harder to gauge that
4080.18 from the smokeable forms of cannabis,
4082.58 especially if those
smokeable forms of cannabis
4084.226 are obtained through sources
4085.73 where there isn't a lot
of clear information
4088.19 about the total amount
of THC in that product.
4091.28 Now, this is all changing
quite a lot nowadays
4093.32 because of the commercialization
of of THC and CBD products
4097.55 and cannabis in a number
of different areas,
4099.53 including in the United States.
4101.27 But still, many people
are ingesting cannabis,
4104.24 THC, CBD through sources
where they don't really know
4106.22 how much they're bringing
into their system.
4108.107 And so, whether or not someone
4110.18 gets incredible anxiety
relief, enhanced sense of mood
4114.08 and focus and wellbeing,
pain relief, et cetera,
4117.11 or whether or not they have
full blown panic attacks,
4119.69 et cetera, is very hard to predict
4122.96 based on dosage information alone.
4125.24 Now, of course, we can
create broad categories,
4127.73 and we are going to talk about studies
4128.93 that create broad categories
of low dose, moderate dose,
4131.57 and high dose. frequent
use and infrequent use,
4134.96 but unlike alcohol, unlike nicotine,
4137.78 we can't really point to
specificity of X amount of alcohol,
4143.45 grams of alcohol per week, which is safe,
4145.34 or X amount of alcohol, which is not safe.
4147.74 And so I know a lot of people
out there are wondering,
4150.26 how often can they smoke cannabis,
4153.29 or how often can they eat
cannabis or THC or CBD
4156.89 in any number of its different
forms and products, safely?
4161.24 Well, we have to really
define what 'safely' means,
4163.79 and we have to really acknowledge
4165.26 that there's a pretty
loose set of controls
4169.46 over what one is bringing
into their brain and body
4172.55 as they ingest THC and CBD,
4175.22 but even under conditions in
which it's very controlled,
4178.49 it's very hard to predict
what those effects will be.
4181.07 So before moving into specifics
4183.26 of taking cannabis or not taking cannabis,
4185.9 who should, who shouldn't,
4186.8 what the medicinal purposes are
4189.317 and what some of the newer,
exciting data point to,
4192.62 I just briefly want to make a list,
4193.94 and I promise very briefly,
I know I'm not often concise,
4196.7 but I do try to be thorough for your sake.
4199.43 I want to make a very brief list
of the different brain areas
4203.36 that are impacted by THC and CBD
4206.6 and why THC and CBD have
the various effects they do.
4212.93 When somebody smokes or ingests cannabis,
4217.37 doesn't matter what the
THC or CBD ratio is,
4222.44 if they experience deficits in memory,
4226.76 and that's almost always
present, that's going to be
4230.54 because of reductions
in electrical activity
4232.91 within this brain region
we call the hippocampus.
4235.43 Hippocampus means seahorse.
It's shaped like a seahorse.
4237.62 Anatomists like to name things
after what things look like,
4240.44 but hippocampus memory, memory is reduced,
4243.47 in particular short-term memory.
4245.03 That's true regardless of whether or not
4246.86 one is using sativa indica or some hybrid.
4252.246 In general, the prefrontal
cortex is going to be activated
4257.33 by the sativa varieties, which
is going to increase thinking
4260.09 and narrowly constrain
focus to some activity,
4264.29 and that's more commonly associated
4265.73 with the sativa varieties.
4267.08 The indica varieties,
as I mentioned before,
4269.21 tend to lead to a suppression of activity
4271.22 in prefrontal cortex, believe it or not,
4273.47 and turn off thinking and planning.
4275.66 This is why indica
varieties are often used
4278.54 for relaxation and for promoting sleep.
4283.61 Regardless of whether or not
sativa or indica variety,
4287.39 and again, regardless of
the ratio of THC to CBD,
4290.78 there is a general
suppression of neural circuits
4293.78 within the so-called basal
ganglia and cerebellum.
4296.0 Basal ganglia and cerebellum
are areas of the brain
4298.139 that are involved in action
planning and withholding action,
4301.19 so that would be the basal ganglia,
4302.33 so-called go, no go circuitry,
4304.88 and the cerebellum, which
is involved in balance,
4307.43 but also motor planning
and motor sequencing.
4311.24 This is why people who smoke marijuana,
4315.265 regardless of the strain,
4317.09 will tend to be less physically mobile.
4320.06 Other common effects are
reddening of the eyes,
4322.55 dryness of the mouth,
4323.48 that's actually caused by
the same general mechanism,
4326.33 which is a reduction in
the secretion of saliva
4329.36 and of tears and lubrication of the eyes
4332.45 from the lacrimal glands of the eyes
4334.22 because of the presence of largely CB2,
4337.82 but also CB1 receptors in
the mouth and on the eyes.
4341.42 And there tends to be,
4343.37 especially with certain
strains of cannabis,
4346.07 increase in appetite, so-called munchies,
4348.86 and that has everything to do
with very, very high density
4353.45 of CB1 receptors in the hypothalamus,
4355.64 and in particular areas
of the hypothalamus,
4357.38 like the arcuate nucleus
of the hypothalamus,
4359.498 other areas as well, of course,
4361.67 that have tons of CB1
receptors, bind THC and CBD
4366.44 and activate the neurons that
strongly stimulate appetite
4369.8 through two mechanisms, one
is a cognitive mechanism
4373.61 of creating a preoccupation with food
4375.86 in anticipation of taste,
4378.02 as well as the experience of taste.
4379.91 So the narrowing of focus
to what you want to go eat.
4384.017 You really crave, I dunno, pizza.
4386.9 It seems to be high fat,
high carbohydrate foods,
4388.7 but really crave pizza
and narrowing of focus,
4393.55 so that you're not thinking
about anything else,
4395.21 but also signaling from
the hypothalamus to the gut
4398.557 to neurons within the stomach, itself,
4401.36 that regulate blood sugar,
4403.07 so there are strong effects
on blood sugar of THC and CBD
4407.87 that generally lead to
increases in appetite,
4410.0 so two parallel mechanisms,
one within the brain,
4412.73 one within the body, increasing appetite,
4414.92 so there's an array of different effects.
4416.567 And as I mentioned before,
CB1 receptors are present
4420.02 all over the nervous system
in the brain, the spinal cord.
4422.24 In fact, the presence of CB1
receptors in the spinal cord
4424.97 largely explains the fact that
THC and CBD, to some extent,
4429.11 although it's not very well studied,
4430.37 can provide some pain relief.
4432.47 I say some, because a
lot of people perceive
4435.411 or believe that they
experience more pain relief
4438.53 from cannabis than they actually do.
4440.72 It actually has a lot to
do with a perceptual shift
4443.3 to basically focusing on other things,
4444.95 but there does seem to
be some antinociceptive,
4448.4 meaning anti pain effects of
cannabis, THC in particular,
4453.02 and that is exerted largely
through effects on CB1 receptors
4457.063 in neurons of the spinal cord.
4459.74 So a broad array of
effects are taking place,
4461.99 regardless of what strain you take
4463.37 and whether or not you eat the cannabis
4465.53 or you smoke the cannabis.
4467.0 And the broad array of effects
can be explained by the fact
4470.03 that that retrograde signaling
can lead to activation
4472.28 or suppression of activity
in various neurons.
4474.95 So now I'd like to take a step back
4476.57 from the biology of
cannabis and THC and CBD
4479.09 and all the signaling
and receptors, et cetera,
4481.1 and really just focus on cannabis use,
4484.16 and wherever possible,
4485.33 I will point to the specific
strains that have been studied
4488.358 and the ratios of THC to CBD,
4491.24 but I have to say that unfortunately,
4494.3 most studies of marijuana, of cannabis,
4497.51 while they have been very careful
4499.85 to detail the amount of THC,
4502.49 low dose, medium dose, or high dose,
4503.99 and actually getting very specific,
4505.1 right down to the number of milligrams
4506.39 or even how much
circulating THC is present
4508.34 after somebody smokes a
joint or ingests cannabis,
4513.41 most studies have not distinguished
4515.99 between sativa and indica strains.
4519.92 And that's unfortunate,
because in the real world,
4522.2 people are distinguishing
between sativa and indica strains
4525.47 in their patterns of
use and what they prefer
4527.3 and what they don't prefer,
4528.133 or even what they prefer
to smoke during the day
4530.33 or ingest during the day versus night.
4531.68 Believe it or not, there are people
4532.52 who are using certain
strains during the day
4534.89 and other strains at night,
4537.32 but the science is yet
to catch up to that,
4539.69 or I should say, more accurately,
4542.81 the general public and the
themes that are emerging
4545.42 and the practices that are
emerging around cannabis,
4548.0 especially in states where it's
decriminalized or legalized,
4551.27 are occurring at such a rapid rate
4552.65 that there's absolutely no way
4553.82 that the science could keep up.
4555.14 This is a naturally occurring experiment,
4557.24 not to say that it's natural,
like people should do it,
4559.13 but it's an experiment
that's happening in real time
4561.2 in the real world, much
faster than controlled studies
4565.1 within university laboratories
4566.39 and other laboratories can keep up.
4567.98 So at this point, I think it's
appropriate to ask ourselves,
4570.71 why do people even use cannabis?
4572.96 What are they trying to achieve?
4574.1 Is it always about not feeling pain?
4576.44 Is it always about reducing anxiety?
4578.39 Well, sometimes it is,
4579.32 but oftentimes people are using cannabis
4581.54 in order to achieve a particular state.
4583.88 And we could use a broad brush and say,
4585.897 "Well, they just like being high,"
4587.96 but while that may be true
in a lot of circumstances,
4591.56 and I have to believe it actually is true
4593.33 in a lot of circumstances,
4595.46 there are a lot of people who use cannabis
4597.92 in a very directed way, or
they get, quote unquote, high,
4601.19 in order to achieve states
4603.05 that to them are particularly attractive,
4605.3 and one such state is
a state of creativity.
4609.047 And this brings us to a broader theme,
4611.09 which is, does cannabis
increase creativity?
4614.39 And if so, is it the THC, the CBD,
4616.76 what's the appropriate ratio
4618.11 or the best ratio for
accessing creativity?
4620.93 This is an interesting and
important discussion, I believe,
4622.88 because creativity is one
of the more sought after
4625.91 and more elusive states
that humans can experience.
4628.85 And yet, if you look at human evolution,
4631.22 you look at our progression
4632.99 in terms of technology development
4634.73 and culture and music
and poetry, et cetera,
4638.759 we really can look to
creativity as the state
4641.72 that fostered so much of that evolution.
4644.6 So whether or not you're into technology,
4646.49 or you're into art or music,
4648.23 whether or not you're just somebody
4649.46 who wants to expand their understanding
4651.83 or their experience of life in some way,
4653.75 creativity is a
fundamentally important state
4657.2 to try and access and to
try and access regularly
4659.48 and to try and tap into,
4660.77 in order to eventually produce something,
4663.35 in order to create something of meaning
4665.0 that exists not just
in that creative state,
4667.07 but to yourself after that
creative state has gone away,
4671.0 so the painting that you
paint in the creative state
4672.92 hopefully is a painting
that still inspires
4674.65 and has impact after you
exit that creative state
4677.968 and that will inspire others,
and this could be true
4680.51 for any number of different
things, not just painting.
4683.27 So does cannabis increase creativity?
4686.12 The short answer is, it depends.
4688.46 First of all, we need
to define creativity.
4690.68 Here we are, thinking as scientists,
4692.81 if not already scientists,
4694.61 and there are basically
two modes of thinking
4697.37 that are associated with creativity,
4698.75 and they don't completely
explain creativity.
4701.45 But if you look in the research,
4702.77 the psychology research and
the neuroscience research,
4705.35 you'll hear about convergent thinking
4708.44 and divergent thinking.
4710.9 Convergent thinking is taking loose ideas
4714.41 and kind of braiding them together,
4716.72 finding a common thread, synthesizing,
4719.84 and organizing those different ideas
4721.94 into some common or specific framework
4725.24 in order to get or create
some specific outcome.
4729.17 So convergent thinking is
basically the person in the room
4733.37 who's listening to all the
ideas and taking them all in.
4736.91 Maybe it's a panel of, how should we
4740.953 get a certain product out to market?
4743.03 Or what are the different motifs
4746.12 that we should include
in a piece of music?
4747.86 Or what should we do
4750.26 in terms of rearchitecting
a given physical space?
4754.13 Taking in those different opinions,
4755.63 those different ideas
from different people,
4757.55 and then synthesizing them and coming up
4760.07 with one or a small
subset of coherent ideas
4763.49 that incorporate some or all
of the ones that they heard,
4766.34 so that's convergent thinking.
4767.39 It doesn't have to involve a
panel of people talking to you.
4770.554 I use that as an example
4772.79 of what goes on inside your own head
4774.53 when you are engaging
in convergent thinking.
4776.24 You're thinking, well,
so and so said this,
4778.76 and I think that, and
you're braiding them through
4780.71 and trying to get some common themes,
4783.29 some common vector to emerge from that.
4785.99 Divergent thinking, on the other hand,
4788.36 is best described as brainstorming.
4790.46 It's exploring ideas
and continuing to move
4793.16 into the variation and
the vastness of ideas
4796.88 in hopes of eventually
being able to converge
4799.04 on some novel idea or framework.
4801.306 So these are similar and related,
4803.12 but typically the creativity process
4805.01 involves first brainstorming
and divergent thinking,
4809.0 and then in order to arrive at something,
4811.28 to actually create
something, the verb 'create,'
4813.95 not just thinking about
what you might create,
4817.13 which occurs during divergent thinking,
4818.42 but actually creating
something, a specific painting,
4821.24 a specific song, a specific
body of literature,
4825.5 a specific scientific project
or experiment and so on,
4829.76 that usually involves convergent thinking.
4832.97 Now these can be explored
in the laboratory,
4835.64 and they can be explored
in the laboratories
4837.29 through sets of different
types of questionnaires
4839.27 or even tasks that you
can give human subjects,
4841.22 and this has been done extensively
4843.32 and across the entire body of data,
4847.1 and by that I mean,
literally hundreds of studies
4849.77 that have explored the relationship
4850.94 between particular neuro
circuits and neurochemicals,
4853.16 convergent and divergent thinking.
4855.77 We can arrive at a principle,
4857.6 and the principle involves a molecule
4861.17 that many of you have heard
about before, which is dopamine.
4863.289 Dopamine is a neuromodulator.
4864.53 It's involved in motivation,
4866.21 and it tends to direct our attention
4867.5 to things outside of us, but
it's also closely related
4870.98 to convergent thinking
and divergent thinking
4873.38 and to the creative process.
4875.12 And therefore, it should
come as no surprise
4877.273 that diseases of the
nervous system, excuse me,
4881.06 such as bipolar disorder,
4883.13 which we've done in episode
all about bipolar disorder
4885.83 or schizophrenia or mood disorders
4889.76 that impact the levels of dopamine,
4891.8 either make it way, way too
high or way, way too low,
4895.88 strongly impact whether or
not people will be creative.
4898.55 And I think the short takeaway
that makes the most sense
4901.25 in terms of framing this,
4902.63 and we covered this on the
episode on bipolar disorder,
4905.39 sometimes called bipolar
depression, is that in professions
4908.78 where there's a lot of creativity required
4910.88 in order to succeed, so
again, musicians, composers,
4913.58 artists, et cetera, you tend
to find more manic depression,
4917.93 and manic depression,
4919.49 at least in the manic states,
the hyperactive states,
4922.64 are correlated with
elevated levels of dopamine.
4926.51 Likewise, it has been seen over
and over throughout history
4930.315 that individuals that have
mild forms of schizophrenia,
4933.53 or even full-blown schizophrenia,
4935.69 many famous painters for
instance, or musicians,
4938.96 they are known to have
elevated levels of dopamine,
4941.63 and they are quite creative.
4942.77 Now, that doesn't mean
everybody who's creative
4944.54 has elevated levels of dopamine,
4946.31 although it's likely that
their levels of dopamine
4948.53 are at least not diminished,
4949.67 and it doesn't mean
that non-creative people
4951.47 have low levels of dopamine,
4952.58 so don't get carried away
with the interpretation here.
4954.83 But the point is this,
4956.494 dopamine levels strongly
relate to the probability
4961.13 that you can engage in convergent
and divergent thinking,
4964.01 and they do so in the following way.
4965.87 When dopamine levels are high,
4969.05 divergent thinking is more likely.
4971.18 That is, when people
have a lot of dopamine
4973.31 circulating in their system,
4974.93 they tend to be very
expansive with their ideas,
4977.51 they tend to brainstorm a lot,
4978.71 they tend to be comfortable
and even want to,
4982.55 or reflexively throw out a lot of ideas
4985.06 so that sometimes even
seem a little disconnected.
4987.89 Some people might think of this
4989.18 as attention deficit, but it's not.
4991.55 It's really the idea of
throwing out disparate ideas.
4996.56 You hear sometimes, you
throw things against the wall
4998.57 and see what sticks, that's
a obviously an analogy,
5001.99 but people are throwing lots
of things against the wall
5005.17 and seeing what stick,
5006.28 and then seeing how the things
that stick fit together,
5008.53 that's divergent thinking,
and elevations in dopamine
5011.65 tend to increase divergent thinking.
5014.08 However, they tend to do this
in an inverted U-shape way.
5018.7 For those of you either
watching on YouTube,
5019.9 I'm just drawing a hump, obviously,
5022.36 and for those of you listening,
5023.65 just imagine a U, the shape of a letter U,
5026.92 and then just flip it upside
down, so it looks like a bump.
5029.388 Turns out that when dopamine
levels are very low,
5031.69 there's a low probability
of divergent thinking.
5033.85 When dopamine levels are
high, as I mentioned before,
5036.13 there's a high level or
probability of divergent thinking.
5039.19 But when dopamine levels
go very, very high,
5042.52 then there's again, a reduction
in divergent thinking.
5045.52 In other words, there's a sweet spot
5047.89 of elevated dopamine
for divergent thinking.
5050.35 And again, divergent thinking
5052.09 is critical for the creativity process,
5054.55 because creativity by definition
5056.65 is taking a novel set of ideas
5059.23 and arranging them in a particular way,
5061.24 or taking existing ideas and
arranging them in a novel way
5065.2 that then you eventually converge
5066.82 on some new product, new
idea, new song, et cetera.
5070.78 Now, convergent thinking follows
a very different pattern.
5074.572 When dopamine levels are high,
5076.54 convergent thinking is not very likely.
5079.6 And when dopamine levels are low,
5081.37 convergent thinking is very likely.
5083.11 So here, using arguably
a very reductionist view,
5087.07 we're looking at all of this
thing we're calling creativity
5089.41 through a very neurosciencey
reductionist lens,
5091.72 we can say this.
5093.55 The creative process
involves going into a state
5095.53 where you're willing to
consider a lot of options,
5098.2 many of which seem distantly
5099.97 or not even connected to one another,
5101.68 and dopamine facilitates
that divergent thinking state
5105.01 in which you are perfectly happy
5106.48 and in fact, experience a
joy, or elation, a comfort
5112.21 and a pleasure in organizing
all these different ideas
5115.45 that to anyone else might
seem not that related.
5119.17 But when your dopamine
levels are elevated,
5120.937 these all seem like great ideas
5122.257 and that maybe there
are connections there.
5124.39 You're not accepting all
of them as true and valid
5126.46 and interesting in combining
them, but there's this idea
5129.67 that it's worth entertaining
the possibility,
5132.7 at least for moments.
5134.44 And then, as dopamine levels drop,
5138.07 there is the process
of convergent thinking,
5139.84 which is taking options
down off the wall saying,
5143.087 "No, no, that doesn't fit with that,
5144.83 "that doesn't fit with that,
5146.027 "but ah, that fits with
that, and that can work.
5148.337 "That feels right or sounds
right or looks right."
5152.26 That's the creativity process.
5154.027 And so, I think this is not just important
5156.88 for understanding cannabis,
5158.32 which we'll get back to in a moment,
5159.73 but it's important for
understanding creativity
5162.1 and brain states in general.
5163.87 Brain states are not, as we would say,
5165.73 a square wave function.
5166.63 You don't just drop into
a trench of creativity.
5168.7 Creativity is not an
event, it's a process.
5171.392 And what I'm telling you
is that it's a process
5173.743 that involves divergent thinking
5175.42 and consideration of a
lot of different ideas.
5177.13 That's correlated with high
but not too high dopamine.
5180.94 And then, one has to
transition into a state
5184.342 of convergent thinking,
which is really honing in
5187.42 on the ideas that seem to have validity
5189.79 or that could have validity
5191.08 and getting rid of everything else,
5192.4 and that's associated with low dopamine.
5194.5 It's more about logical
implementation and consideration
5197.71 as opposed to thinking about
and considering everything.
5200.92 So let's now return to the question
5202.39 of whether or not cannabis
5203.89 and its different components
increase creativity.
5208.21 And when you look at
the literature on this,
5210.25 you find studies that very
clearly point to a yes,
5213.88 it increases creativity,
and it's not surprising,
5216.76 therefore, that cannabis can
increase dopamine transmission,
5220.99 that is dopamine levels,
in certain brain areas,
5223.39 in particular brain areas
involved in thinking and planning.
5227.05 So cannabis increases
dopamine in these areas.
5229.45 Elevated dopamine increases
divergent thinking,
5232.0 and divergent thinking is
associated with creativity,
5234.34 and there are studies
that support the idea
5236.38 that cannabis can increase creativity.
5240.28 However, there are at
least as many studies
5243.73 that say that cannabis does
not increase creativity,
5246.76 that cannabis increases
consideration of multiple ideas,
5250.12 perhaps through elevation of
dopamine and related systems,
5253.87 but that ultimately the
ideas that converge from that
5256.9 are not truly creative ideas,
5258.37 at least they don't meet the criteria
5259.72 for creative brainstorming
5261.34 and extraction of ideas
that are truly novel,
5264.13 so it doesn't increase
creativity, so which one is it?
5268.06 Well, fortunately,
5268.893 there's an entirely
distinct set of literature
5271.51 that has taken all the other
literature into consideration,
5274.75 and here's where we arrive.
5276.34 So there's a really nice study
5277.6 that explored creativity
in cannabis users,
5280.6 and we will provide a link to this study.
5282.337 First author is Emily LaFrance,
5284.56 and the title of the paper,
5286.93 somewhat amusing in its own right,
5288.76 which is, it starts with a question,
5290.8 inspired by Mary Jane, of course,
5292.6 Mary Jane being one of
the old school versions
5294.976 or ways of talking about
cannabis or marijuana.
5298.42 Nowadays, people refer
to it mainly as pot,
5300.64 as other names too, of course,
5301.78 and the title of the paper is,
5303.557 "Inspired by Mary Jane
Mechanisms Underlying
5306.137 "Enhanced Creativity in Cannabis Users."
5308.2 And I really like this study
for a couple of reasons.
5310.87 First of all, they looked at
people who did not use cannabis
5316.27 as well as people who used cannabis,
5318.7 so they had two different groups,
5319.93 but they did not evaluate
creativity of the cannabis users
5324.79 while they were under the
influence of cannabis.
5327.25 They looked at the level of creativity
5330.047 in these cannabis users
5332.59 when they were not under
the influence of cannabis
5335.41 and asked whether or not
their ability to be creative
5338.32 was enhanced by cannabis.
5339.7 Now we're going to compare this to studies
5341.86 in which people come into the laboratory
5343.93 and actually use cannabis,
5344.83 and then they evaluate
creativity under that context.
5348.246 But this study has some unique takeaways
5350.68 that I think are really interesting.
5351.91 First of all, they did, yes,
5354.43 see evidence for enhanced creativity,
5356.92 and when I say enhanced creativity,
5358.39 I mean within the context of
this divergent thinking thing
5361.397 that I talked about a moment ago.
5364.33 And when I say enhanced,
5365.62 I mean significantly
greater than in non-users,
5368.05 so people that don't use cannabis.
5369.97 So right now I can imagine
that all the cannabis users
5372.062 are cheering, "Yes, cannabis
increases creativity,
5375.137 "makes people more creative
than they would be otherwise."
5377.8 Well, this is interesting.
5379.45 We have to ask ourselves
how that was accomplished.
5382.96 And it turns out that
one of the major ways
5384.67 in which it was accomplished
is that cannabis users,
5387.64 even if they're not under
the influence of cannabis,
5391.06 are far more open to novel ideas,
5394.15 and they have a more
explorative and reduced anxiety,
5398.98 or I should say lower
anxiety mode of thinking
5401.47 when they explore novel ideas,
5402.88 which is essential for divergent thinking.
5404.86 So they observed both enhanced divergent
5407.44 and convergent creative type
thinking in cannabis users.
5412.96 And the source of that, they conclude is,
5416.83 and here, I'll just quote,
"Cannabis users' higher levels
5419.957 "of openness to experience are responsible
5421.937 "for their enhanced
self-reported creativity
5423.677 "and convergent thinking
test performance."
5426.07 So it's not necessarily that cannabis
5429.13 is increasing the capacity
of the brain areas
5431.41 that are associated with creativity,
5433.96 but rather, cannabis appears
to be increasing an openness
5439.03 and probably doing that in
part through lowering anxiety
5442.51 in particular people, and that openness
5445.33 is leading to inclusion of more ideas
5448.63 during the divergent thinking process.
5451.21 They're willing to consider throwing up
5452.86 more things on the wall to see
if they stick, so to speak.
5455.95 So in their conclusions, they
have a really nice statement.
5458.38 Again, I'll just read from the paper,
5460.21 because they said it better
than I ever could, quote,
5462.587 "While mainstream media
has propagated the idea
5464.957 "that cannabis expands the
mind and enhances creativity,
5468.377 "our results show the link
between cannabis and creativity
5470.927 "is largely a spurious correlation,"
5473.68 meaning that it's not the case
5476.08 that cannabis increases creativity, but,
5480.997 and I inserted the 'but' in this quote,
5485.039 but "driven by differences in personality
5488.507 "that are related to cannabis use.
5490.547 "For example, openness to
experience that are related
5493.037 "to both cannabis use and
augmented creativity."
5496.265 This is a real chicken/egg
argument. What do I mean by that?
5499.603 What I mean is, this paper finds
5502.6 that people who are
more open to experience
5506.08 are more likely to use cannabis,
5508.33 and people who use cannabis
5509.95 are going to be more
open to new experiences,
5513.46 and that combination of
features, openness to experience,
5516.88 and what that openness to
new experiences brings,
5520.48 enhances the convergent
and divergent thinking
5523.72 that is characteristic
of the creative process.
5526.78 So in short, cannabis
increases creativity,
5530.08 but through changes in personality
5532.45 that tap into the creative process,
5534.76 rather than directly
impacting the neural circuits
5538.22 that, for instance, turn on creativity.
5541.12 And I have to say, this
study is really important,
5544.27 because by exploring cannabis users,
5548.41 not while under the influence of cannabis,
5550.9 they were able to tap
into this very important,
5553.99 what I believe to be fact.
5556.09 Because if you think about a study
5557.56 in which you would have
one group using cannabis
5560.47 and another group not using cannabis,
5562.12 and then you give them some
task that taps into creativity,
5564.91 you will see effects and very likely,
5566.77 you'll see effects where
cannabis might even increase
5568.9 divergent and convergent
thinking and creativity.
5571.09 Those results have actually been published
5572.35 many times before.
5573.85 But given the varied
effects of cannabis and THC
5576.213 that we talked about earlier,
5577.57 through all of that
complex signaling stuff,
5579.64 you can imagine that there
will also be other studies,
5581.95 and in fact, there are,
5583.3 where divergent and convergent
thinking and creativity
5586.75 is not assisted by cannabis
5589.24 and might even be reduced
by ingesting cannabis.
5592.0 However, if one considers
that divergent thinking
5594.82 is absolutely crucial to
the creativity process
5598.69 and the range of things
that one will explore
5601.69 will be enhanced by openness
5604.33 and by reduced levels of anxiety,
5606.85 so a willingness to
explore different options,
5608.8 some of which might seem completely crazy,
5611.23 and cannabis increases
the personality types
5614.29 and reduces the anxiety that
create that sense of openness,
5618.1 well then it makes perfect sense
5619.048 why cannabis would increase creativity
5622.111 in certain individuals, but not directly.
5625.33 And this study, the
one I just referred to,
5627.97 which I should say was published
5629.23 in the journal,
"Consciousness and Cognition,"
5630.94 and again, we'll provide a link to it,
5633.07 did a wonderful job of teasing out
5635.95 this impact of cannabis on personality,
5638.92 which then impacts creativity.
5641.32 So if somebody asks you,
or if you're wondering,
5643.48 or if you feel like cannabis
increases creativity,
5646.6 in some sense the answer is 'yes,'
5648.13 but the answer is 'yes'
because of the ways
5650.29 that it shapes openness to new ideas
5653.14 and can, I should say 'can,'
because not in everybody,
5656.02 but can, in some
individuals, reduce anxiety.
5658.848 What this means is that
if you are somebody
5661.99 who experiences anxiety or
increased levels of focus
5667.253 from cannabis, regardless of the strain,
5670.998 and here I have to imagine people
5672.01 are exploring different strains,
5673.36 if they're exploring them at all,
5675.52 exploring different modes of delivery,
5676.9 smoking or ingestible, et cetera.
5678.73 If you're somebody who
experiences anxiety,
5681.67 it's very likely that you won't
have the increased openness
5687.25 to experience and divergent ideas
5689.47 that will facilitate creativity.
5690.88 However, if you are somebody
who achieves heightened levels
5693.43 of relaxation and reduced
levels of anxiety from cannabis,
5697.63 regardless of which strain we
happen to be talking about,
5700.45 well then, yes, it will position you
5703.09 to be in a heightened state of creativity,
5705.79 at least as defined by convergent
and divergent thinking.
5708.55 One of the more characteristic,
5710.2 or I should say stereotype
qualities of people
5713.92 that smoke a lot of
marijuana or ingest cannabis
5716.65 through other means is there
changed patterns of speech.
5720.34 In fact, there's a lore
in the clinical realm
5725.53 that you can predict or
get some strong indication
5729.43 as to whether or not
somebody is a cannabis user
5731.74 or pot smoker based on their voice
5734.563 and their particular tone of voice
5737.23 and their lack of inflection.
5739.27 There's a lot of speculation here,
5740.71 but fortunately, it's been studied.
5742.39 So I'd like to discuss now
5743.68 whether or not cannabis can
impact patterns of speech,
5746.77 both acutely, meaning while
under the influence of cannabis,
5750.1 and over time, in chronic cannabis users.
5753.67 And when I say 'chronic cannabis use,'
5755.2 I want to be very specific what I mean.
5756.82 Chronic cannabis use
does not necessarily mean
5759.04 that people are smoking cannabis
5760.27 or ingesting cannabis every day,
5762.1 although certainly if they are,
5763.06 that qualifies as chronic use.
5765.37 Chronic use is regular use over time
5767.8 of anywhere from twice a week or more.
5770.23 So using cannabis once a month
5771.85 would not be considered chronic use,
5773.35 even if it's for many, many years.
5775.57 Using cannabis or ingesting cannabis
5777.19 in some way or form twice a week
5779.29 would be considered chronic use.
5781.45 Then of course, some of you out there
5782.83 are going to ask me to
split hairs and say,
5784.247 "Well, what if somebody
uses it twice a month?"
5786.61 Well, listen, the clinical literature,
5788.89 and the scientific literature
don't get that specific.
5791.5 And of course, they're an
infinite number of ways
5793.36 to arrange one's cannabis use,
5795.61 everything from zero, none at all,
5797.47 to constantly, every day, all
day and everywhere in between.
5801.22 But think of chronic use
as twice a week or more.
5805.0 Think of occasional use as less than that
5807.67 and realize that within the
realm of chronic use, excuse me,
5811.39 that 'or more' can be
anywhere from twice a week,
5814.39 to every day, to just in
the evenings, et cetera.
5818.92 The effects of chronic use of cannabis,
5822.64 as I just defined it, on
speech have been studied.
5827.95 Because of this characteristic,
5830.14 drawing out of certain
syllables, a slowing of speech,
5834.7 and in many cases a total
change or alteration
5839.17 in the way that people
speak and use language,
5842.613 both when under the influence of cannabis
5845.65 and when not under the
influence of cannabis
5848.08 if they're chronic users.
5849.88 And here we really want to
distinguish between THC and CBD
5853.93 and just make it really simple and say
5855.67 that CBD is not responsible
5859.18 for most of the psychoactive
effects of cannabis,
5861.97 whereas THC is, and again,
5864.13 the ratio of CBD to THC is
going to be relevant there,
5867.22 but let's just think
about cannabis and THC
5870.01 as one in the same for this
portion of the discussion,
5872.89 realizing that, of course,
5873.723 they are not exactly the same thing.
5875.68 There's an excellent study entitled,
5877.247 "Adults with History of
Recreational Cannabis Use
5879.647 "Have Altered Speech Production,"
5881.86 and we will provide a link to that,
5882.88 first author, Adam Vogel,
really like this paper.
5886.06 It was published in the journal,
5887.627 "Drug and Alcohol Dependence."
5889.205 We will provide a link to it for you
5891.88 if you'd like to peruse it in more detail.
5894.37 The title itself, "Adults
with a History of Recreational
5897.197 "Cannabis Use Have Altered
Speech Production,"
5900.07 tells you pretty much
everything you need to know,
5902.29 except there's some
important nuance in here,
5904.75 because, as I mentioned earlier,
5906.85 people who smoke sativa
varieties of cannabis
5910.18 oftentimes will become more
talkative, much more talkative.
5914.44 However, whether or
not people tend to rely
5917.35 on sativa cannabis use
or indica cannabis use,
5922.439 there is a very consistent finding
5924.97 that people who are chronic users,
5926.32 again twice a week or more,
5928.06 recreational use or medicinal use,
5930.76 undergo pretty profound changes
in the way that they speak,
5934.36 but in a very specific set of ways.
5937.93 Now, first of all, the changes in speech
5940.66 shouldn't surprise us at all,
5942.64 because both sativa varieties of cannabis
5945.76 and indica varieties of cannabis
5948.13 impact those brain centers
involved in movement,
5950.86 the basal ganglia, remember
the go, no-go circuitry,
5953.68 the circuitry that makes
you want to do things,
5955.51 and the circuitry that makes
you want to withhold action?
5958.15 And it tends to shift the body and brain
5961.09 toward more inaction.
5963.294 And cannabis impacts CB1
receptors in the cerebellum,
5967.21 which is involved in motor
planning, execution and balance.
5971.17 So, regardless of whether or not people
5972.97 are using cannabis of the
sativa or the indica variety,
5977.56 there are disruptions in motor circuitry.
5979.51 And, as you may have heard,
5980.92 if you listened to our episode
5982.15 with Rockefeller professor,
Dr. Erich Jarvis,
5985.36 who works on speech and
movement, speech is movement.
5990.67 The movements of the mouth,
the movements of the hands,
5993.19 those are intimately related
in terms of our speech.
5995.89 In fact, the centers of the
brain involved in hand movements
5998.95 are part of the speech
areas and vice versa.
6001.865 Erich actually pointed out
6003.21 that if you put your
hands behind your back,
6005.1 provided you normally do
have use of your hands,
6007.29 it actually will reduce
your fluidity of speech,
6010.047 and so I'm going to put them
back in front of me now.
6013.77 The point is, smoking marijuana
or consuming marijuana
6018.3 by edible changes one's speech
6021.54 and does it in a very specific way.
6023.1 And in this study by Adam
Vogel and colleagues,
6026.67 they explored a huge different
variety of aspects of speech.
6030.51 And this can be done
using spectral processing,
6032.7 which is fancy nerd speak
6034.23 for looking at how much
inflection there is
6036.48 or looking at how long people hold vowels
6038.76 or consonants, et cetera, and again,
6040.29 these are people not under
the influence of cannabis,
6042.84 but rather people who tend
to be under the influence
6045.72 of cannabis when not
participating in the study,
6048.08 in other words, chronic
recreational cannabis users.
6051.39 So what are the two major
shifts that cannabis causes
6054.236 on our patterns of speech?
6056.1 Well, the first one is a change
6057.96 in what's called spectral tilt.
6059.97 Again, that's fancy nerd speak
6061.17 for vocal effort and intensity.
6063.78 So, I'm not a pot smoker, I confess,
6068.167 but if I were to say the sentence,
6071.767 "Vocal effort and intensity
6073.357 "are important components of speech,"
6076.2 that's the way I would say that sentence
6078.0 if I was striving to
enunciate very carefully
6080.52 and to accent certain words and syllables.
6084.21 A pot smoker or somebody who
uses recreational cannabis
6088.56 fairly often would have
reduced spectral tilt,
6092.193 AKA, vocal effort
intensity, and might say,
6096.416 [mumbling] "Spectral tilt is
vocal effort in intensity,
6099.187 "and it differed between
groups and appeared to change
6101.287 "in line with the duration of
abstinence from cannabis use."
6104.88 That I think is not a far cry
6107.13 from the change in spectral
tilt that they observed here.
6109.53 In addition, there are
changes in verbal timing,
6114.12 that is pronunciation of words
6116.67 and accenting particular
syllables of words
6120.24 in people that consume
cannabis or smoke cannabis.
6124.74 So rather than emphasize
particular words within a sentence,
6129.36 so again, I'll just use
a sentence from the paper
6131.28 so that you can gain more
knowledge from the paper,
6133.447 "Cannabis," and I'll say it
the way that I would say it,
6136.05 since I'm not a cannabis user.
6138.937 "Cannabis, marijuana, is
the most commonly used,
6141.397 "illicit drug in the world with
approximately 4% of adults,
6144.667 "aged 15 to 64 years reporting recent use,
6147.607 "and the citation is from
the United Nations Office
6150.037 "on Drugs and Crime, 2019."
6153.03 So that would be the way
6154.05 that I would typically read that sentence.
6155.94 And having gone into
the data on this paper,
6158.46 and of course evaluated references therein
6161.16 and listened to some of
the spectral analysis
6164.22 that they include as data,
6166.2 you can literally go
into these papers online
6167.97 and hear recordings of
people who are cannabis users
6171.27 or non-cannabis users,
6172.8 and I'll try and give you a a clear sense
6175.35 without picking an extreme
example of how somebody
6178.62 who's a fairly consistent or
even occasional cannabis user
6182.55 might read that very same sentence.
6185.908 "Cannabis, marijuana, is
the most commonly used
6188.917 "illicit drug in the world
with approximately 4% of adults
6192.547 "age 15 to 64 years reporting recent use,
6195.757 "and the citation comes from
the United Nation Office
6198.277 "on Drugs and Crime in 2019."
6201.0 Now you'll notice that
wasn't a dramatic difference.
6203.49 And, of course I could
have taken the liberty
6205.5 to pick an extreme example of the sort
6207.21 that they did occasionally observe
6209.52 in evaluating subjects for this paper.
6211.77 I could have said something like,
6213.548 [mumbling in low tone]
"Cannabis, marijuana,
6214.627 "is the most commonly used illicit drug,"
6216.45 but frankly that would've been
selecting an outlier example,
6219.36 and I don't want to do that.
6220.23 I don't want to skew the data as they say.
6222.72 Rather, if you heard the
first time I read the sentence
6227.07 and the second time I read the sentence,
6228.3 what's mainly different is the difference
6231.9 in the amount of enunciation and accenting
6235.17 of particular words and
symbols within a sentence.
6237.51 So the total content that's
delivered is exactly the same,
6240.39 and while I wasn't measuring my pace,
6242.58 the overall rate of communication
is essentially the same,
6247.38 but there's less lilting
and falling of the voice
6250.41 and less accenting.
6251.28 That's the major consistent
effect of cannabis use.
6254.37 Now of course, there
are examples of people
6256.35 who are using a lot of cannabis,
6258.66 and it impacts brain centers
6260.25 involved in movement and speech,
6261.75 so much so that they really do have
6263.88 the really drawn out kind of, nah,
6266.61 and oftentimes this will
be detected in the laugh.
6269.13 There's this stereotypical stoner laugh,
6271.89 as it's sometimes called.
6273.06 Rather than say "Ha, ha, ha"
6274.38 or that's a fake laugh, obviously.
6276.72 It's hard to make myself laugh
6277.89 if something's not actually funny.
6278.97 I'll have to think of something funny.
6280.38 When people say like, "Ha!"
6281.37 That's a bit more of
the way I might laugh,
6283.38 like, "Ha," sort of the inspiratory laugh
6285.87 or the, "Ha," which is expiratory laugh.
6288.51 People who use cannabis chronically
6290.25 will often do that, "Haa,"
which is the back of the throat,
6293.988 [laughs raspingly] it's
neither inspiratory
6297.27 nor expiratory laugh,
and believe it or not,
6299.04 there's an entire literature
6300.06 on inspiratory, inhaling,
versus expiratory laughs,
6303.03 and there's also a literature on cannabis
6306.177 altering the pattern of
inspiratory and expiratory laughs.
6309.45 It almost sounds like a sarcastic laugh
6311.82 when, in fact, they may not
be feeling sarcastic at all.
6314.37 And I have a very close
friend and colleague
6316.92 who's a phenomenal
neurosurgeon and neuroscientist
6319.29 by the name of Dr. Eddie Chang.
6320.52 He's the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,
6322.29 and his lab and him
are expert in the study
6325.89 of neuroscience controlling
language and speech.
6329.61 And he often tells me that he can predict,
6334.14 with almost certainty,
6335.28 whether or not somebody
is a regular cannabis user
6338.25 based, not just on the patterns
of speech that they use,
6342.33 but even just by recording
specific neurons in their brain
6345.33 that underlie the laugh reflex
6347.91 and certain patterns of speech.
6349.47 So this idea that cannabis
use changes your ability
6352.56 to speak and enunciate clearly
does appear to be true.
6355.86 And the stereotype that cannabis use
6358.59 tends to create more of a drawl
6360.69 or, if you will, a laziness in the laugh,
6364.83 and some of the reflexive
enunciations that people use,
6368.04 does also appear to be true.
6369.3 And I say all that, of
course, with the caveat
6372.0 that many people out there
will know individuals
6375.06 or perhaps you,
yourselves, are individuals
6378.0 that may use cannabis but that
have incredible articulation,
6382.23 probably better than mine
6383.34 and better than other people out there
6384.69 who speak for a living, so I'm not saying
6386.85 that 100% of people that
use cannabis regularly
6389.64 can't speak well or clearly.
6391.35 That's simply not what I'm saying,
6393.03 and I don't want to
communicate that idea at all,
6395.55 but it is the case that people
6396.66 who are regular cannabis users
6398.76 are impacting the neural
circuits involved in movement.
6401.37 Movement also controls speech,
6403.14 and therefore, cannabis
is impacting speech.
6406.44 Now I'd like to turn our attention
6407.58 to whether or not cannabis
can increase sexual activity,
6411.12 sexual desire, and/or sexual function,
6414.48 so we're going to be talking
about libido, about sexual desire
6417.6 and about effects of cannabis on hormones.
6420.63 And while this might
sound like a discussion
6422.7 that's purely oriented towards
recreational use of cannabis,
6426.12 that is people using
cannabis to heightened
6428.43 or increase their sense of
arousal for sexual activity,
6432.06 it actually ventures into
the clinical realm too,
6434.61 meaning there have been
excellent peer-reviewed studies
6437.64 that I'll describe to you in a moment
6439.11 exploring the use of cannabis
or THC, more specifically,
6442.616 for something called hypoactive
sexual desire disorder,
6447.03 which refers to a persistent
or recurrent deficiency
6450.45 or absence of sexual
fantasies and thoughts
6452.76 and/or desire for, or
receptivity to, sexual activity.
6457.32 This is a disorder that is fairly common,
6459.66 anywhere from 6% to 9% of
people, both males and females.
6463.62 It used to be considered higher prevalence
6466.32 in females than in males,
6468.33 but now those numbers
seem to be evening out.
6470.79 So basically, there are
anywhere from 6% to 9%
6474.48 of people out there who have
very diminished sexual desire.
6478.389 And so, a number of those people
6480.45 are interested in figuring out ways
6482.16 to increase their amount of sexual desire,
6484.29 and of course, there are people
in the general population
6487.23 who may not have hyperactive
sexual desire disorder
6490.71 who are interested in using
cannabis recreationally
6493.35 in order to increase their desire for,
6495.63 or their experience of, sexual activity.
6498.57 Now first we have to acknowledge
6499.89 that sexual desire and activity
6501.81 is a complex set of processes,
6504.12 meaning it's not just
one event, sex, the verb.
6507.72 It involves arousal, it
involves sex, the verb,
6511.77 and it involves a whole set of
mindsets and emotional states
6515.37 that vary tremendously
between individuals.
6517.83 But once again, we can distill
out a few basic principles,
6521.505 and I should emphasize,
6523.56 these are by no means the only chemicals
6524.827 and neuro circuits
involved in the sexual arc,
6528.33 as we'll call it, desire,
the act of sex, et cetera,
6531.75 but they are central to
it, they are vital to it.
6534.3 They would be considered
6535.56 what I would call necessary
but not sufficient,
6538.47 so there'll be other
chemicals involved too,
6540.3 but the main chemicals in neuro circuits
6541.8 are those involved in dopamine,
6543.54 so the so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway,
6545.85 in particular, a brain structure
called nucleus accumbens,
6548.76 which we'll talk about more in a moment,
6550.41 is vital to all motivated
behaviors and to the seeking out
6554.46 of all particular types of
pleasurable experiences,
6557.61 and sex is no exception.
6558.99 So when we hear that the
nucleus accumbens is activated,
6561.99 that almost always means that dopamine
6564.12 has been released in that area
6565.83 and other areas of the brain body,
6567.57 and we can consider dopamine central
6569.55 to the desire for,
pursuit of, an act of sex.
6574.539 In addition to that, there
are molecules like oxytocin,
6578.58 which are involved in pair bonding,
6580.05 and they're going to be
neural circuit specific
6581.58 to the oxytocin circuitry,
6583.62 but in terms of sexual
arousal and sexual behavior,
6587.4 it's really the dopamine pathway
in this nucleus accumbens,
6590.16 which are especially vital.
6592.297 That allows us to address the question,
6594.6 does cannabis increase, decrease,
6598.89 or have no effect on sexual desire
6601.68 and/or the ability to have sex?
6604.68 And therein, we will find
some very interesting answers,
6608.7 and because, once again,
6610.59 it will point to the fact
that the effects of cannabis
6614.76 on different individuals
can be highly divergent,
6618.06 meaning in one set of individuals,
6620.31 cannabis will make them far less anxious.
6622.77 And in another set of individuals,
6624.45 the same strain of cannabis,
at the same dosage,
6626.79 will make them extremely anxious.
6628.35 The same can be said
also of sexual activity.
6631.98 And this was beautifully illustrated
6633.99 in the context of sexual
desire in the journal,
6636.697 "Psycho-pharmacology," in
a paper published in 2017.
6639.45 The title of this paper is,
"Individual Prolactin Reactivity
6643.267 "Modulates Response of Nucleus
Accumbens to Erotic Stimuli
6646.897 "During Acute Cannabis
Intoxication, an fMRI Pilot Study."
6651.051 So I'll give a little bit of definition
6653.61 to some of the terms in the title
6654.75 that will make it easier for
you to understand the paper,
6657.66 but then I'll just march
through the results,
6659.16 because they're very straightforward
6660.66 and easy to understand
and very interesting.
6663.39 fMRI is just functional
magnetic resonance imaging,
6666.57 so basically subjects in this experiment
6669.3 came into the laboratory.
6672.06 They were either people who
had not used cannabis before
6676.23 or who had used cannabis before.
6678.849 They were placed into a brain scanner,
6680.97 one of these fMRI devices.
6682.68 It looks like a tube that
people are backed up into
6685.802 and then they can view images in there,
6687.267 and their brain can be imaged
6688.83 without having to remove any skull
6690.36 or drill into the skull, no neurosurgery.
6693.72 The participants in
this study were grouped
6695.85 according to whether or
not they had experienced
6697.71 any aphrodisiac effects
6699.185 during the intoxication with cannabis,
6701.79 so that would be the first group, Group A,
6703.77 they literally called it
group A for aphrodisiac.
6705.96 And then the second group,
6707.07 and this is the only thing I
don't like about this study,
6708.84 is rather than call it group B,
6710.34 they called them 'group non A,'
6712.71 which just gets a little confusing.
6714.75 So I'll try and simplify all this.
6716.46 There are two groups,
6717.87 and one group experiences sexual arousal
6722.22 when under the influence of
cannabis, THC specifically.
6726.27 The other group does not.
6727.59 And it turns out this is a very
commonly observed divergence
6732.06 of effects of cannabis.
6734.31 Some people experience
a lot of sexual arousal
6736.86 from cannabis and THC in
particular, and some people do not,
6740.61 in fact, they experience
suppression of sexual desire,
6744.12 and it's always been a
little bit mysterious
6745.95 as to why that is.
6747.99 Well, in this study, they showed people
6751.77 in both groups erotic images,
6753.75 and they measured sexual arousal
6755.94 through a number of different measures.
6756.99 We won't go into all that.
6757.89 It was largely subjective.
6759.36 There have been other studies
6760.29 where they've actually measured things
6762.09 like erections in males and
vaginal lubrication in females,
6765.822 so-called autonomic responses
that people can't lie about,
6770.4 so to speak, and that
tap into other aspects
6774.36 of the so-called sexual arousal process.
6777.69 In this study, they
also took blood samples
6779.79 to look at the concentration
of things like cannabinoids,
6783.21 so this is a really nice study
6784.47 in that they actually
measured how much THC
6786.964 was in the bloodstream
in different individuals
6789.72 who reacted to these erotic
stimuli in different ways.
6792.45 And they measured
hormones, namely cortisol,
6795.24 which is a stress hormone,
6796.32 which tends to negatively correlate
6797.85 with sexual arousal and prolactin.
6800.58 And the interesting
takeaway from the study was
6803.61 that for people, and it didn't matter
6805.83 if it was males or females,
'cause they looked at both,
6810.3 for people that experienced
elevated prolactin levels
6814.964 under cannabis intoxication,
that's how they refer to it.
6819.3 People take cannabis,
they measured prolactin.
6821.01 Some people had elevated
prolactin and some people did not.
6824.966 For the people that had
elevated levels of prolactin,
6829.23 they did not observe activation
6831.57 of brain areas associated
with sexual arousal,
6834.39 in this case, the right nucleus accumbens,
6836.46 so you have two nucleus accumbi,
6838.86 I guess they would be called,
one on each side of the brain,
6840.78 and the activation of that brain area
6842.51 is strongly associated with
dopamine and with arousal
6845.55 and sexual arousal in
particular in this study,
6847.92 and if people had elevated prolactin,
6850.02 they did not experience
activation of nucleus accumbens,
6852.93 and they did not report
feeling sexually aroused
6855.45 to those pictures, at least
not to the same degree
6857.37 as the other group.
6858.54 So some people's prolactin levels go up
6860.67 when they ingest cannabis,
6862.71 and those people do not
achieve elevated levels
6865.92 of sexual arousal when under
the influence of cannabis,
6869.4 even if they're looking at erotic stimuli.
6871.738 That makes sense, because prolactin
6875.79 is mutually inhibitory, as we would say.
6879.15 It's kind of in a push-pull with dopamine.
6881.07 When dopamine levels are high,
6882.33 prolactin levels tend to be low,
6884.61 and when prolactin levels are high,
6886.2 dopamine levels tend to be low.
6888.03 The other group, so-called Group A,
6890.58 that experienced elevated
levels of sexual arousal
6893.52 when under the influence of cannabis
6895.26 and viewing erotic stimuli,
6897.78 that group did not show
elevated levels of prolactin
6901.62 in response to cannabis.
6903.84 So this, I believe,
6904.86 resolves a longstanding
controversy in the field,
6908.07 which is, does cannabis
increase sexual arousal?
6911.34 Well, it depends.
6912.33 If you fall into the category of person
6914.25 who has elevated levels of prolactin
6915.99 in response to cannabis,
then no, actually cannabis
6920.16 will suppress your sexual
response and desire.
6922.921 If, however, you are in
the category of person
6926.048 that does not have elevated
levels of prolactin
6929.85 in response to cannabis,
6931.74 well then, erotic stimuli can potentially
6935.13 and in fact, do increase sexual arousal
6937.8 in the majority of individuals.
6939.36 Now, many of you are probably hearing this
6940.86 and wondering whether or not you fall
6942.6 into one category of
individual or another.
6945.9 And the key thing here to understand
6948.99 is that levels of prolactin
heading into the study
6953.13 did not predict whether or
not people would respond
6957.95 to cannabis with elevated or non elevated
6962.34 or even reduced levels of sexual arousal.
6964.98 It was whether or not people's
prolactin levels went up
6968.73 or did not go up, that predicted
6971.31 whether or not their levels
of arousal would go up or not.
6974.73 So if you are somebody who, yes,
6977.13 does experience elevated
levels of sexual arousal
6980.46 and function went under
the influence of cannabis,
6983.61 well that's very likely that cannabis
6985.2 does not increase your prolactin levels,
6986.91 at least not to a significant
degree while you're taking it.
6990.51 And if you're somebody who
does not experience increases
6993.18 in sexual arousal or function
6995.07 or even diminished sexual
arousal and function
6996.783 when under the influence of cannabis,
6998.4 it's very likely that cannabis
6999.78 is increasing your levels of prolactin.
7001.76 Unfortunately, there's
no way to know or predict
7004.37 based on some other measure.
7006.41 I think the outcome measure,
7007.88 that is increased or not increased
7010.16 or even reduced sexual arousal
is really the litmus test
7013.04 by which one can figure that out.
7014.99 While we are on the topic
of the effects of cannabis
7017.24 on sexual function and
hormones like prolactin,
7020.36 it's probably worth mentioning
7021.68 that cannabis has been studied extensively
7024.11 for its impact on other hormones,
7026.3 and we can summarize those
literature in the following way.
7029.99 And here I'm referring to
studies only on adults.
7032.09 We'll talk about the
developing brain and body
7033.86 in a little bit, but it is very clear
7037.43 that smoking cannabis
increases prolactin levels.
7042.978 Very, very clear.
7044.48 Now, you might say, "Didn't,
you just describe a study
7047.277 "about a set of individuals
whose prolactin didn't increase
7051.477 "and as a consequence,
7053.067 "their level of sexual desire went up?"
7055.79 Yes, there are a subset of individuals
7057.56 for which that's true, but
people who smoke cannabis
7062.37 do experience increases in prolactin,
7065.42 and that's especially pronounced in people
7067.19 that smoke cannabis
more than twice a week.
7069.8 So this is important, prolactin,
as I referred to earlier,
7074.45 is reciprocal or mutually
inhibitory with dopamine.
7079.79 One way to think about
this is in the context
7081.53 of the normal sexual arousal arc
7083.63 whereby dopamine is increased
7085.43 when people are sexually
aroused, but then after orgasm,
7089.6 both in males and females,
prolactin levels skyrocket.
7092.84 This is actually what creates
7094.4 the so-called refractory period for males
7096.41 during which they cannot
achieve erection again
7098.42 for some period of time.
7099.62 That relates directly to how long
7102.38 the prolactin increase lasts.
7106.46 Prolactin is also increased
in new parents of all species,
7110.27 including humans, which
at least partially,
7115.1 explains some of the reported
or typical reductions
7118.52 in sexual desire and
activity in new parents.
7121.07 Now, there are other reasons for that too,
7122.24 sleep deprivation, but nature is smart
7125.09 and has arranged a set
of hormones and circuits
7127.4 in the brain and body,
such that when tending
7129.65 to a newborn is the most
important thing, it relegates,
7133.16 it reduces the importance
of producing more children
7137.84 and sexual activity in those moments
7140.09 and days and weeks, sometimes longer.
7141.95 So when prolactin levels are
up, dopamine levels are down.
7144.56 Smoking marijuana more than twice a week
7146.57 significantly increases prolactin.
7149.06 There are fewer studies exploring
7151.4 whether or not edible
marijuana has the same effect,
7154.28 although the preliminary evidence
suggests that it does not.
7158.21 I get into this in a lot more
detail in a future episode,
7161.21 all about hormones with Dr. Kyle Gillett,
7164.12 who's been on this podcast before.
7165.95 But he verified that, and
my read of the literature
7168.41 is that the edible forms
of marijuana, cannabis,
7173.476 probably again, let's put
an asterisks next to this,
7177.08 but it appears do not have as as much
7179.48 of a prolactin elevating effect
7181.1 and therefore, not as much of
a dopamine suppressive effect
7185.03 and therefore, not as much
7186.2 of a testosterone suppressing effect,
7188.39 and that gets to the
issue of testosterone.
7190.04 Does cannabis, marijuana
suppress testosterone?
7192.77 And this is a very controversial
literature and here's why.
7196.7 Some studies say, "Yes,
it suppresses testosterone
7199.98 "in males and females," and keep in mind
7202.67 that testosterone in
females is vital for libido
7204.77 and cognitive function,
cellular repair, et cetera,
7208.43 so it's not just important
in males, of course.
7211.4 However, other studies say that cannabis
7214.37 does not decrease testosterone,
7216.53 and it seems to depend on
whether or not the cannabis
7220.49 is brought into the system
by way of smoking or edible.
7223.67 And it seems to depend on
whether or not the cannabis
7227.21 is used chronically by
an individual or acutely.
7230.03 And here I just want to zoom out and say
7231.98 that studies on cannabis or
drugs of any kind in humans
7235.19 are really complicated.
7236.24 If you think about it,
7237.08 someone has to come into the laboratory,
7238.85 and let's say you want to
study chronic cannabis use.
7241.542 Well, you can't keep them in
the laboratory all the time,
7243.98 so you have to rely on their self-report
7245.72 of how often they use
cannabis and in what form,
7247.94 and you can't really control
from one individual to the next
7250.43 of how much cannabis and THC
7251.99 they're bringing into their system.
7252.95 One person might smoke
cannabis out of a bong
7255.65 and take big, deep, lungs-full
bong inhalations or such.
7262.31 Other people might smoke joints.
7264.59 Other people might use edibles.
7266.15 It becomes very complicated
to know what people have done
7268.46 and that they're reporting it accurately,
7270.35 and no joke here, especially if marijuana
7272.99 is impacting the
short-term memory systems.
7275.0 They might not actually remember.
7276.17 They might not be tracking it that well.
7278.66 Contrast that with
studies of the acute use
7280.97 of cannabis and THC, where
people who are not regular users
7284.09 come into the laboratory and now suddenly,
7286.55 with institutional guidelines
and safety protocols,
7289.58 are under the influence
of THC and cannabis.
7291.77 Well, now you're dealing with a person
7292.97 who may not have experience
with the elevated heart rate
7297.17 and blood pressure that's
characteristic of cannabis,
7298.687 'cause it is a stimulant,
7300.14 at least when initially
brought into the system,
7302.09 even if it might eventually
lead to relaxation.
7304.43 So now you've got someone who's anxious
7305.84 or somebody who's not
anxious, who's deeply relaxed,
7308.78 and you're trying to study these effects,
7310.04 so it's a moving target of sorts,
7312.41 and it's very complicated to
study marijuana and cannabis
7315.94 in its various derivatives in this way.
7317.81 Now you can probably appreciate better
7319.91 as to why there's so little nuanced data
7322.58 about sativa versus indica,
7324.83 versus different ratios of CBD and THC.
7328.01 It's really difficult to do these studies
7329.81 in the first place.
7330.65 That said, the general rules
7332.27 are smoking marijuana increases
prolactin in men and women,
7334.94 which will reduce
dopamine and testosterone.
7337.31 Smoking marijuana chronically,
7339.643 meaning more than twice a week,
7342.232 does appear to reduce
testosterone significantly
7345.32 and elevate so-called aromatase enzymes,
7347.886 which are the enzymes
7349.31 that convert testosterone into estrogen.
7351.56 This might partially explain the effect
7353.401 that occurs in about 35% of
males, which is gynecomastia,
7358.4 which is a development of
breast tissue in males,
7361.1 in particular young males,
7362.69 who have elevated levels of testosterone
7364.55 or who are taking exogenous testosterone
7367.37 for testosterone replacement therapy
7369.35 or if they're taking high
doses, anabolic steroids,
7371.78 or in females, the
increase in breast size,
7375.38 which is due to additional estrogen
7378.23 from testosterone converted to estrogen.
7379.94 So it does appear that
marijuana and cannabis
7381.8 increase estrogen, reduce
testosterone, increase prolactin,
7384.89 especially in chronic users.
7387.47 Now, I'm sure that some
people out there will say,
7389.03 well, their testosterone
levels are exceedingly high
7392.33 or they are fine, meaning
the constellation of symptoms
7395.45 associated with low testosterone
and elevate estrogen
7398.23 are not present in them.
7400.16 That probably means one
of two things, or both.
7404.81 They either had elevated
levels of testosterone
7407.09 to begin with, so their
ceiling was higher,
7408.74 so bringing it down didn't
have that much of effect,
7410.66 or that they have very low levels
7413.51 of aromatase in their system.
7415.64 There are some anecdotal evidence
7418.22 that smoking particular
parts of the marijuana plant,
7421.22 in particular, the seeds,
can increase aromatase
7425.42 in the conversion of
testosterone to estrogen.
7427.43 I think in the old days,
7428.54 the lore was the seeds make you sterile,
7430.58 and I think that was related
to what I just told you,
7432.71 this increase in conversion
of testosterone to estrogen.
7435.83 There's a vast literature
7437.57 on the effects of cannabis on fertility.
7440.833 Yes, it does seem to alter sperm motility
7445.22 and sperm health and function
7446.66 when taken chronically,
more than twice per week,
7448.85 in particular high doses
of high potency THC.
7452.27 This is something we will
cover in far more detail
7454.31 on a future episode all about fertility.
7456.44 And in females, there's
an increase in estrogen
7459.56 as a consequence of smoking marijuana
7462.47 and increasing prolactin
and estrogen in parallel.
7466.43 Whether or not that's
detrimental isn't clear,
7469.07 although I point out that
elevated estrogen and prolactin
7473.152 can be associated,
again, can be associated,
7476.21 not necessarily, and
certainly, not causative,
7478.67 but can be associated with elevated levels
7481.003 or frequency of breast cancer detection.
7483.62 So cannabis and its effects on hormones
7486.08 are not without consequence.
7488.87 There are effects of cannabis
7490.37 on cortisol in some individuals.
7493.07 It greatly increases
cortisol due the anxiety
7495.65 and paranoia it can create,
7498.02 and in other individuals
it reduces cortisol.
7500.33 Again, we have these divergent effects.
7502.25 But I want to be very clear,
the effects on prolactin,
7504.89 meaning elevated prolactin,
the effects on testosterone,
7507.08 meaning, at least most studies point to,
7509.12 reduced levels of testosterone
and increased estrogen.
7512.51 That seems to be true
for most all individuals
7515.42 that chronically use cannabis,
7517.76 whereas the effects on
cortisol tend to be divergent.
7521.42 Cannabis increases cortisol
in some individuals
7523.67 and decreases cortisol in others.
7525.29 In general, increases in
cortisol that are ongoing
7528.68 are not healthy for us and so on.
7531.606 And then of course, there are
other effects on hormones,
7534.53 and I'll just briefly summarize those,
7535.94 that THC in particular, not
CBD, but THC in particular,
7539.87 is known to be strongly inhibitory
7541.67 for something called
gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
7543.98 This is a hormone that's
released from the brain,
7546.02 from the hypothalamus
that then feeds onto,
7549.5 or I should say signals
to the pituitary gland,
7551.69 which is also near the roof of your mouth,
7553.01 a lot of stuff happening
near the roof of your mouth
7554.51 it turns out, biologically,
7556.1 and reduced levels of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone
7559.25 caused by cannabis use,
7560.51 reduced levels of LH luteinizing hormone
7562.85 and FSH, which reduce
levels of testosterone
7565.91 and sperm production in males
and egg health and ovulation
7572.3 and menstrual function in females.
7574.97 Now, I'm sure there are a
number of women out there
7577.88 who will say they have perfectly
normal menstrual cycles
7579.92 despite using cannabis.
7582.14 I'm certainly not going to dispute that,
7584.54 but if you are somebody who's
trying to maximize fertility
7588.17 or regulate or balance hormones,
7590.87 marijuana and cannabis reduces GnRH.
7594.369 That is the gonadotropin-release
from the hypothalamus
7598.07 and thereby reduces luteinizing hormone
7600.74 and follicle stimulating hormone,
7602.24 which are released from the pituitary
7603.83 and travel in the bloodstream
7605.51 to support normal ovarian
function and health
7608.6 and normal testicular function and health
7611.12 in females and males, respectively.
7613.25 Up until now I've been
discussing the biological
7615.35 and psychological effects of cannabis.
7617.96 Now I'd like to shift our attention
7619.46 to some of the negative
health effects of cannabis
7622.55 and shine light on some of the individuals
7625.49 or groups out there that
need to be especially wary of
7628.91 and probably avoid cannabis use entirely,
7631.73 including ingestion of
cannabis by way of edible.
7636.23 And I frame things that way,
7637.31 because I think there is an
increasingly large number
7640.07 of people out there that
appreciate that smoking tobacco
7644.72 or smoking cannabis, vaping tobacco,
7649.04 yes, vaping tobacco, or vaping cannabis,
7652.88 each and all have negative
health consequences on the lungs
7656.72 and on the so-called
endothelial cells of the body,
7659.39 the cells that make up the vasculature,
7661.25 the capillaries and blood vessels.
7663.38 If you don't already know
this, I'll make it very clear,
7666.92 and I'll make it very brief.
7668.63 Whether or not you smoke or
vape tobacco or cannabis,
7673.46 you are severely impairing the
function of endothelial cells
7677.51 that make up the capillaries
and blood vessels
7679.85 of your brain and body,
7681.23 and that is known to decrease
cognitive capacity over time,
7685.85 increase probability of strokes,
7687.65 severely impact lung function,
7691.04 and also lead to things like
peripheral neuropathies.
7694.4 It leads to sexual dysfunction,
7696.32 because of lack of blood
flow to the genitals,
7699.71 can lead to other aspects
of reproductive damage,
7702.53 including to the ovaries and testes.
7704.78 Essentially, there is no
other way to state it,
7707.27 except that smoking and vaping
7710.06 have negative health consequences
7712.52 that are independent of the substances
7715.753 that people are trying to
get into their bloodstream
7719.03 by smoking or vaping.
7720.32 So people smoke and vape tobacco,
7722.0 and people smoke and vape
cannabis, and in both cases,
7725.66 if we just set aside the
direct effects of tobacco
7729.05 and the direct effects of cannabis,
7732.44 we can confidently say that
the process of smoking,
7736.1 of inhaling smoke into the lungs,
7737.81 and yes, also vaping,
bringing the chemicals
7742.22 that transport nicotine,
or in this case, cannabis,
7745.73 into the lungs by way of vaping
7748.16 are both severely detrimental
to endothelial cells.
7751.55 I think a few years ago, when
vaping wasn't as prominent,
7754.4 there was this question and this idea
7756.38 that maybe vaping was
going to be far healthier
7758.87 or at least not as bad as smoking,
7762.65 but now we can see a huge number
7764.9 of negative health effects of vaping,
7766.49 some of which are distinct
from the effects of smoking.
7769.25 So if you'd like more information
on smoking versus vaping,
7772.34 please see the episode
that I did on nicotine.
7774.29 We will also do an entire episode
7776.12 all about vaping in the future,
7778.64 but there's really no way
to slice it and dice it
7781.4 or candy coat it.
7782.63 The fact of the matter
is that smoking has clear
7785.6 and severe negative health
consequences, regardless of
7788.63 whether or not you're smoking
tobacco or cannabis, THC,
7793.7 and vaping has negative
health consequences,
7797.81 whether or not you're using
the vape to bring in nicotine
7800.75 or THC or some combination of THC and CBD.
7804.29 That's simply the way it is.
7805.58 With that said, now I'd
like to focus our attention
7807.74 on the direct effects that cannabis has,
7810.5 either by way of THC action
or by way of CBD action
7815.18 in terms of positive or
negative health effects
7818.27 on the brain and body, and
we're going to explore that
7820.85 first as a function of age.
7822.92 And the reason we're going to do that
7824.6 is related to a fact that I mentioned
7826.55 at the beginning of the episode,
7827.99 which is that the CB1
and the CB2 receptors,
7831.56 the two receptors for cannabis
to which THC and CBD and CBN
7836.66 and all other psychoactive
compounds of cannabis bind to
7840.8 to have their actions are
present throughout development.
7845.36 Believe it or not,
7846.2 they are present very
soon after conception,
7849.38 and the CB1 and CB2 receptors
actually play a critical role
7853.61 in the development of the fetus.
7855.8 Now, you might wonder why that is,
7858.44 because of course, the developing fetus
7860.45 doesn't necessarily expect to see cannabis
7862.61 or to be exposed to
cannabis and THC and CBD.
7865.88 But, as you recall, endogenous
cannabinoids are present
7870.65 in the adult brain and body
and endogenous cannabinoids,
7874.37 it turns out, are also present
in the developing fetus.
7876.98 In fact, endogenous
cannabinoids are present
7879.59 at much greater levels
in the developing fetus
7882.2 than they are after a child is born,
7885.89 and levels of endogenous cannabinoids
7887.84 actually go down across development.
7890.27 I find this really interesting.
7891.56 What this means is that
endogenous cannabinoids
7894.11 and activation of the
CB1 and CB2 receptors
7897.05 are an integral part
of neural development,
7900.35 and this is going to
become especially relevant
7902.24 in considering whether
or not pregnant mothers
7904.16 should or should not use cannabis or CBD,
7907.939 and it also points to some
very interesting biology
7912.258 in terms of how the brain develops
7914.33 and how the body develops.
7915.68 Now the development of the brain
and nervous system and body
7918.95 is a fascinating and vast literature,
7921.17 certainly far too vast to
cover in today's episode,
7924.17 especially at this late hour as it were,
7926.9 but we will have a future episode
7928.82 all about brain development.
7930.86 In terms of the effects of cannabis,
7933.74 it's sufficient to say
that cannabinoid receptors
7937.37 are present and active
in the developing fetus.
7941.18 They're present and active in the newborn.
7943.52 They're present and active in adolescence.
7946.04 And across that time, from
conception until adolescence,
7950.12 endogenous cannabinoids
are mainly responsible
7952.85 for the actions of those
cannabinoid receptors.
7955.97 During that time, the
cannabinoid receptors
7957.95 are having very specific effects
7959.81 that are distinct from
their effects later in life,
7962.33 and those effects can largely be explained
7964.22 in terms of neural development.
7965.54 Again, we don't have time for
an entire lecture on this now,
7969.2 but during development,
7971.63 your body was a collection
of a bunch of cells.
7974.33 It's actually called a blastula,
7975.98 which means a ball of
cells, and then those cells
7978.11 actually have to grow out connections
7979.76 and duplicate themselves,
7981.41 and this is a very interesting process
7983.27 by which neurons initially
are situated far apart,
7986.15 and then they grow out connections
7987.71 and make contacts with one another.
7989.03 They remove certain connections,
7990.32 depending on what kind of
life events you're exposed to.
7993.29 If you have a wonderful
event early in life
7995.57 or a traumatic early life,
7997.49 those connections change, et cetera.
8000.34 The important point for today's discussion
8001.87 is that the CB1 receptor, in particular,
8005.11 is expressed on every neuron
in the developing brain
8008.71 and has been shown to be important
8010.06 for every aspect of neural development,
8013.09 from the proliferation of cells,
8015.19 meaning getting enough
cells to create a brain,
8017.53 to the outgrowth of the so-called axons,
8020.05 the little wires that connect
up neurons with one another,
8023.26 to the steering, the direction
8025.78 which those axons go in
development, which is essential,
8030.64 and even so far as to
explain the connections
8034.24 that form between neurons,
the so-called synapses,
8036.73 and then how those synapses work.
8038.71 So the basic statement here is
that endogenous cannabinoids
8042.97 and CB1 receptor activation are critical
8045.13 for every aspect of brain
wiring and development.
8048.588 With that in mind, the
statement I'm about to make
8051.43 is absolutely terrifying, at least to me,
8054.19 and frankly, it should be
terrifying to you as well.
8057.01 And the statement is,
the current statistics
8061.75 on cannabis use in pregnant
mothers is absolutely shocking.
8067.6 The most recent survey of pregnant mothers
8069.87 in the United States
show that 15%, one-five,
8073.848 15% of pregnant mothers
report using cannabis
8077.65 in some form or another, either smoking it
8080.5 or more likely ingestion of in edible,
8083.89 because they are aware
of the negative effects
8085.69 of smoking on the developing
fetus, ingestion of an edible
8089.08 to increase THC and/or
CBD during pregnancy,
8093.58 which to me, I have to say,
8095.38 as a developmental neurobiologist
is, frankly, it's scary.
8100.54 It's absolutely scary,
because that CB1 receptor
8103.6 is not just a minor player
in neural development.
8106.36 It is absolutely central
to every critical aspect
8109.48 of brain wiring and development.
8111.55 Now, the long-term implications
8112.99 or even the short-term
implications of this,
8114.91 15% of mothers self-reporting
the use of cannabis
8118.93 at some point during
pregnancy are not yet known.
8122.2 This is, as we would say, an
experiment that's ongoing.
8125.74 But I'd be remiss if I
didn't point out these data
8128.59 and just implore you,
please, please, please,
8131.44 if you are pregnant or
considering getting pregnant,
8133.33 you're a cannabis user, whether
or not you're using edibles,
8135.49 if you're a CBD user, please
do whatever is necessary
8141.31 to not ingest cannabis or smoke cannabis
8145.15 or ingest CBD during pregnancy.
8147.79 Now, there may be certain
clinical indications
8150.13 by which your physician and your OB/GYN,
8153.34 and the pediatrician that will eventually
8155.56 be the pediatrician for your
child will prescribe CBD,
8160.75 although it's hard to
imagine what those are.
8162.46 I contacted a number of different
pediatricians and OB/GYNs
8167.167 and not a single one said
they would ever suggest,
8170.5 and in fact would strongly
discourage their patients
8172.99 from using cannabis during pregnancy.
8176.02 But I think that the advent
of edible forms of cannabis,
8180.94 and the combination of THC
and CBD in certain products,
8185.83 and the fact that most
people view CBD as safer,
8188.8 because it does not include,
or does not have, I should say,
8192.85 the psychoactive effects that THC does,
8195.25 has led to a situation where you have 15%
8199.6 of pregnant mothers using cannabis
8201.37 at some point during pregnancy
8203.14 and maybe even frequently
throughout pregnancy,
8205.42 and the effects on the developing fetus
8207.31 are completely unknown.
8209.08 But recall that cannabis
and THC and CBD outcompete,
8214.84 meaning they park in the receptor
8216.91 for endogenous cannabinoids
8218.65 and prevent endogenous cannabinoids
8221.2 from having their normal
level and pattern of action,
8224.53 so this is absolutely critical.
8226.12 I cannot encourage you enough,
or rather, I should say,
8228.61 I cannot discourage
enough the use of cannabis
8232.78 and any related compounds in cannabis,
8236.034 edible or smoked, certainly not smoked,
8238.36 but even edible during pregnancy,
8241.18 and certainly in breastfeeding,
lactating mothers,
8245.47 the same is also true.
8246.43 Recall that cannabis and THC and CBD
8250.03 are incredibly lipophilic.
8251.948 They're fat soluble,
8253.81 and they get into cells very readily,
8255.85 and they cross the blood brain barrier.
8257.29 They cross the blood placental barrier.
8259.75 So when I encountered this statistic,
8261.61 I had to kind of wipe my eyes a few times.
8263.53 I could not believe it, and
yet I crosschecked that number
8266.86 with a few other studies.
8267.97 A few others have come
in a little bit lower
8269.77 at somewhere like 13% to 14%,
8271.747 and a few have come in
a little bit higher,
8273.34 but the average of 15% is
both striking and shocking,
8277.42 so I don't know how to make
the message more clear.
8279.4 I hope that is clear.
8280.6 Please do not use any cannabis, THC
8284.778 or related things including
CBD, smoked or edible
8289.36 if you're pregnant, lactating, et cetera.
8292.9 Now we are at the point
where we need to consider
8295.27 some of the negative
health effects of cannabis
8297.16 that have been well documented
in peer-reviewed studies.
8299.59 And before I do this,
8300.94 I want to return to a
point that I made earlier,
8302.68 which is that nothing I am about to say
8305.41 relates directly to issues of legality.
8308.14 If we consider alcohol, for instance,
8310.48 alcohol is legal in
most areas of the world.
8312.94 It's certainly legal in the US,
8314.83 and yet there's an age limit for its use.
8317.98 Typically, it's not available to people
8319.96 until they're 21 or older.
8321.7 It's not to say that
certain people don't use it
8323.26 before age 21, but it's not legal.
8326.98 It is illegal to buy or possess alcohol,
8330.13 consume alcohol before age 21,
and I think with good reason,
8333.46 because the brain is still developing.
8336.01 Likewise, we can have a informed
discussion about cannabis
8341.265 and its various components
8343.179 that can fully acknowledge the reality,
8346.75 which is that one of the major
harms of cannabis in the past
8351.7 has been the legal ramifications
of cannabis being illegal.
8355.498 That's a statement that is
no longer controversial,
8359.02 and this is not a discussion
8360.31 about legalization or non legalization.
8362.32 If you look to the scientific literature,
8364.27 the epidemiological literature,
8366.73 there are wonderful data
out of Carleton University
8369.34 and elsewhere in Canada showing that
8372.022 many of the negative
effects of marijuana and THC
8377.8 are due to the criminal
justice system, itself,
8381.13 that is the creation of
illicit drug businesses,
8385.63 the creation of organized crime,
8387.82 the creation of a number
of different features
8390.25 related to the illegality of cannabis.
8394.24 And again, this isn't the
topic of today's episode,
8397.33 but that should be acknowledged.
8399.25 And at the same time,
we need to acknowledge
8401.35 that when a compound, a drug
or whatever you want to call it
8405.7 becomes legal, there's
a tendency to assume
8409.0 that it's safe and safe for everybody.
8411.25 And with respect to cannabis
and THC and perhaps even CBD,
8415.87 but certainly for THC and
cannabis that's smoked or vaped
8420.82 or consumed in edible form,
that is simply not the case.
8424.78 There are clear data pointing
to negative health effects
8428.47 of cannabis use and THC use,
which again, is not to say
8431.83 that there are not positive effects
8433.87 on mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.
8436.06 Those are out there and they exist,
8437.53 and we will mention
some of those of course,
8439.24 and we've talked about some of those,
8440.83 creativity for instance, et cetera.
8442.93 But if we do not acknowledge
the negative health effects
8446.32 that are documented in the literature,
8448.33 then we are overlooking
some very important data,
8451.57 especially as it relates to
the development of psychosis
8454.99 in certain individuals.
8457.0 So, with that said, there
are very strong data,
8461.23 and I will provide links
to these resources,
8463.3 pointing to the fact that for people
8464.86 who are chronic users of cannabis,
8467.23 that is using it twice a week or more,
8469.75 that over time, their levels
of anxiety actually increase,
8473.53 and this is true even for individuals
8475.6 that are using strains of cannabis,
8477.22 that while under the influence
of cannabis, reduce anxiety.
8481.51 Over time, meaning over the
course of 12 or more months,
8486.106 there is a well-documented
effect of the anxiety relief
8491.83 that cannabis and THC initially brought,
8495.25 being less and less potent.
8496.87 That is people need to smoke
more of it or ingest more THC
8501.34 in order to achieve the same
level of anxiety relief,
8504.46 and in some cases, a
switch from anxiety relief
8508.03 to increase in anxiety,
8510.13 and again, that's increase in anxiety,
8512.44 not just when the drug
is not being consumed,
8515.92 but also while under the
influence of the drug.
8518.65 Why would that be?
8519.94 We have to go back to our
understanding of the CB1 receptor
8523.96 and the potency with which THC
binds to that CB1 receptor.
8529.3 When THC is brought into the
system over and over again,
8533.68 meaning twice a week or more,
8536.02 the binding of THC, that CB1 receptor,
8539.35 eventually causes a
habituation or attenuation
8543.52 of the entire process
of binding the receptor
8546.79 and creating the psychoactive effects.
8548.71 So initially it creates anxiety relief,
8550.78 but over time, the affinity for
the receptor doesn't change,
8555.13 meaning it can still park in that slot
8556.63 with a lot of affinity, a lot of strength,
8559.39 but there are fewer receptors available,
8563.14 and then the signaling that's
downstream of those receptors
8566.56 becomes less and less robust.
8568.75 Now this is a topic we didn't get into
8570.85 in too much detail today,
because I didn't want to include
8573.58 even more biological
detail, but the CB1 receptor
8576.91 is a so-called G protein-coupled receptor.
8579.842 That's a mouthful, but a
G protein-coupled receptor
8582.7 basically is like a bucket brigade.
8584.83 So while some receptors
in the brain and body
8586.66 are such that when something,
a chemical binds to them,
8589.99 that receptor has a direct action,
8591.7 like it opens and allows
stuff to rush into the cell,
8594.1 increases the excitability of the cell,
8596.32 so called fast effects,
8598.06 these G protein-coupled receptors,
8600.4 and CB1 is a G protein-coupled receptor,
8603.61 they are more like a bucket brigade
8605.05 where they kick off a
process through one molecule
8608.35 that then is handed
off to another molecule
8610.78 that then is handed off
to another molecule.
8612.88 It's a long chain or cascade of events.
8616.21 Those long chains or cascades of events
8618.7 have a lot of opportunity for
regulation, for adjustment.
8622.45 Receptor systems in the brain and body,
8624.13 especially receptor systems
like the cannabinoid system
8626.44 that are used to being
tickled, not punched,
8629.62 tickled by endogenous cannabinoids,
8631.39 every once in a while
some binds, has an effect,
8633.389 but certainly not bound
with incredible potency
8638.14 and over and over again as they are
8639.61 when THC is coming into the system.
8641.56 Well those systems eventually, over time,
8643.18 they adjust themselves so that the body
8646.237 and those cells can achieve
so-called homeostasis.
8649.39 So when people are using
THC more than twice a week,
8653.77 what ends up happening is those
G protein-coupled receptors
8656.29 in the downstream signaling mechanisms
8658.03 start to adjust themselves,
8659.5 and it requires more and more drug,
8663.34 so either higher dosages
or more frequent use,
8667.0 and a lot of the positive effects,
8669.43 the so-called decrease in anxiety,
8670.93 increased focus, increased creativity,
8672.7 some of that starts to wane,
it starts to dissipate,
8675.22 and people wonder why they
have to use so much cannabis
8677.86 just to achieve a fraction of the effect
8680.47 that they used to be able to
achieve with even a lower dose.
8684.58 So anxiety is getting worse over time,
8686.71 and that's anxiety during the drug use
8689.26 and outside of the drug use.
8691.18 Some people work around that
or try to work around that
8694.99 by using varying strains of cannabis
8697.96 or changing the pattern of
delivery from smoking to vaping
8701.65 or from vaping to edible and
from edible to transdermal.
8704.77 Anyway, they go through
a lot of gymnastics
8706.75 and writhing and seeking,
8709.9 but nonetheless, anxiety
increases over time.
8712.87 Also, it's very clear that
depression increases over time
8717.46 and especially, this is surprising to me,
8719.65 but especially for individuals
that were not depressed
8722.77 at the the outset of their use.
8724.3 In other words, they
didn't start using cannabis
8725.89 because they were depressed,
8727.51 but rather the depression starts to emerge
8730.69 as a consequence of the
cannabis and THC use.
8734.35 So that's serious, in fact, we now know,
8737.8 based on really solid
epidemiological evidence,
8740.26 that depression is not a strong predictor
8743.05 of seeking out cannabis.
8745.48 It doesn't drive terribly many people
8748.12 to seek out cannabis use,
8750.04 but cannabis use, itself, makes
people four times likelier
8754.48 to develop a chronic major depression.
8757.63 So anxiety is increasing,
depression is increasing,
8761.65 and this turns out to
be especially relevant
8765.01 and important to young people.
8766.84 Why do I say that?
8767.77 Well, if you look at the data,
8769.36 and again, I think some
of the strongest data
8771.52 are data to come out
of the Canadian system.
8773.92 They've done some really
beautiful controlled studies.
8775.96 I really hope to invite some of the people
8778.42 who arranged and ran those studies
8780.7 as guests onto the Huberman Lab Podcast.
8782.86 But if you look at the data out of Canada,
8785.59 or you look at some of the data
8786.61 out of Northern Europe and the US,
8788.41 what you find is that the probability
8791.17 that somebody will use cannabis
8793.327 and then go on to use it chronically,
8796.0 correlates very strongly with age.
8797.77 So for instance, some of the
highest degree of cannabis use
8800.86 is among individuals 16 to 24 years old.
8804.296 In fact, in individuals
who are 16 to 24 years old,
8808.42 and in particular, in students
and people who are working,
8812.68 surprising, more than in
unemployed populations,
8816.19 being young, 16 to 24, at
least to me that's young,
8819.25 and being a student or
working doubles the likelihood
8823.72 that somebody is going to use
cannabis on a regular basis,
8826.45 twice or more per week.
8828.64 The typical age of initiating
cannabis use nowadays
8831.16 is about 19 years old, so 18.7,
8834.79 and about 20% of people
in that age bracket,
8838.42 of 16 to 24 years old,
are using cannabis daily,
8842.02 either by vaping, by smoking or by edible.
8844.9 That's an enormous number,
at least by my read.
8847.18 It's an enormous number,
8848.38 and here's why it's of
really serious concern.
8852.1 During the ages of 16 to 24,
8855.38 the cannabinoid receptors
are still available.
8858.82 They are not being as strongly driven
8860.8 by endogenous cannabinoids,
8862.66 but by ingestion of THC and/or CBD,
8867.94 there are downstream effects
8869.38 on the signaling within those cells
8871.36 that all the data point
to creating a much,
8876.55 much higher likelihood of
developing major depression,
8880.72 severe anxiety or psychosis at later ages.
8884.68 So to be very clear, cannabis use,
8886.75 between the ages of 16 to
24, in both males and females
8891.37 is increasing anxiety,
increasing depression
8894.52 in the immediate years and
within the one year's time or so,
8897.49 so much so that people are
using the cannabis ongoing
8901.18 in an attempt to reduce that anxiety
8904.12 and reduce that depression,
8905.62 but in addition to that, the cannabis use,
8908.17 and because of the signaling
mechanisms involved
8911.38 are predisposing those individuals
8913.87 to psychosis later in life.
8916.63 If you look at individuals
who start using cannabis,
8918.97 even younger, age 14,
or even as young as 12,
8923.71 the probability of
psychosis later in life,
8926.08 in particular schizophrenic
or schizophrenic-like episodes
8929.71 more than doubles, so this
is of really serious concern,
8934.27 and this is completely aside
8936.52 from any so-called positive effects
8938.74 or beneficial effects of cannabis
8941.35 that people might derive from
occasional use as adults,
8944.02 meaning people older than 25.
8946.03 So for the person who's older than 25,
8947.77 who eats an edible every once in a while,
8950.02 or who smokes cannabis
every once in a while,
8952.21 and people love to make the argument,
8954.1 it's not as bad as alcohol,
8955.81 which frankly, is a terrible argument,
8957.55 because if you saw our episode on alcohol,
8959.104 [laughs] alcohol is pretty bad,
8960.512 but even so, it's just
not a good argument.
8963.73 It's saying that something is good,
8965.17 because it's not as bad as something else
8967.09 is simply just not a
good or valid argument,
8969.31 at least not biologically speaking.
8972.194 The use of cannabis in young populations
8975.25 is very strongly predisposing
people to psychotic episodes,
8978.7 and we know the mechanism
by which this occurs.
8982.72 This occurs by a thinning of
the so-called gray matter,
8986.89 and it's called gray matter
because with neurons,
8990.31 nerve cells, they have
a so-called cell body,
8992.74 that's the part that contains the DNA
8994.69 and manufacturers all the
neurotransmitters, et cetera.
8997.15 And those are shipped out to
the other parts of the neuron
9000.12 that include the axon,
the wires between axons,
9002.46 and those axons under the microscope,
9005.13 because they have a lot of
fatty tissue around them,
9007.02 and this is healthy fatty tissue
9008.31 that allows electrical
transmission to be fast,
9010.35 that fatty tissue, those
portions of the cells,
9012.84 are called white matter,
9013.95 so you have gray matter and white matter.
9015.6 Gray matter are the so-called cell bodies
9017.4 where the DNA and all the
stuff is manufactured.
9019.71 White matter or the axons or the wires
9023.334 through which all the key
components are shipped out
9026.34 to the synapse, et cetera.
9029.19 Wonderful data and I do say wonderful,
9031.41 because it is part of a
large scale consortium,
9033.78 and we will provide a link to the paper.
9035.1 This was published in
"Translational Psychiatry"
9037.74 just this year, point to the fact
9040.95 that adolescent cannabis
use accelerates the thinning
9045.24 of the prefrontal cortex and
the gray matter in particular.
9047.94 So what this means is, while
during normal development,
9051.6 the gray matter, the prefrontal cortex
9053.88 and all the cells there
are indeed intended,
9056.28 it's a normal process for it to thicken
9058.47 and then thin a little bit
as connections are adjusted
9062.58 and people learn and mature and grow up,
9064.65 this is part of the normal
healthy maturation process,
9067.23 independent of cannabis use.
9069.84 When kids, 'cause these
really are kids, use cannabis,
9073.86 and it doesn't matter the
mode of cannabis delivery,
9075.9 whether or not it's vaping
or smoking or edible,
9078.39 that gray matter thins at
a much, much greater rate.
9081.57 And the reason I like this paper published
9083.25 in "Translational
Psychiatry" this year so much
9086.43 is that they link the
amount of cannabis use,
9089.55 heavy, moderate, light or no cannabis use,
9092.79 to the rate of prefrontal
cortical thinning,
9095.52 and it's absolutely clear from these data
9098.52 that the more often young people,
9101.55 meaning individuals between
the age of 14 and 25,
9104.76 the more often they consume
or smoke or vape cannabis,
9108.84 the faster and the more extreme
that cortical thinning is.
9112.29 And the cortical thinning is occurring
9113.67 in exactly the area of the brain
9115.11 that's involved in planning,
in control over one's emotions,
9118.95 in reflexes, in organizing one's life
9123.18 in a number of different ways,
9124.02 anywhere from cleaning
one's room, literally,
9126.69 knowing what goes where,
9128.13 to making plans that
extend out through the day,
9130.74 through the week, through a year,
9132.18 essentially becoming a
functional human being
9134.07 involves using your prefrontal cortex
9136.02 in a variety of different contexts
9137.55 and different time domains,
the time domain of an hour,
9140.52 the time domain of a day.
9141.87 Making plans and being
able to execute plans
9145.05 is fundamental to being
a healthy human being,
9147.0 and it's absolutely clear from these data
9149.1 that the more cannabis one uses,
9152.82 the more impaired those
neural circuits are.
9155.43 There's simply no other
way to to view these data.
9158.85 In fact, so much so, that even
small amounts of cannabis use
9162.48 are associated with rates
of cortical thinning
9164.61 and degrees of cortical thinning
that are really detrimental
9167.67 and concerning for normal
cognitive processes.
9171.24 If you were somebody who smoked marijuana
9174.21 or consumed cannabis
in any form or another
9177.18 during adolescence, does that mean
9179.82 that your prefrontal cortex
can never be rescued,
9182.04 that it can't come back?
9183.81 Well, the short answer is,
9185.31 it probably can be rescued to some degree.
9187.41 It will depend on how much
cannabis you were using
9190.98 and how often and what strains
of cannabis, et cetera.
9194.94 There's really no traveling back in time,
9196.68 as my graduate advisor used to say.
9198.48 Time machines are broken.
9200.07 At least for now, we
don't have time machines.
9201.51 So all you can really
do is try and emphasize,
9204.75 first of all, quitting
cannabis in any form
9208.049 and focusing on behaviors that
emphasize endothelial cell
9213.63 blood flow health to the brain,
9215.73 so that would be cardiovascular exercise,
9218.76 adequate nutrition, not smoking nicotine,
9221.52 and there are a number of
other things that one can do.
9223.89 We will do an entire episode
9225.06 all about trying to reverse
the effects of cannabis
9228.99 and other drug use during adolescence.
9230.85 We don't have time to do a
deep dive on that right now,
9232.98 but all the things that
standardize and promote health,
9236.039 adequate sleep, good social connection,
9239.313 regular cardiovascular and
weight training exercise,
9243.51 healthy nutrition, and what
that represents to you,
9245.85 healthy metabolic function
and weight, et cetera,
9248.1 those are all going to
facilitate some recovery
9251.19 of brain function, in particular,
9253.05 prefrontal cortical function,
9254.7 by way of all the positive effects
9256.14 that those behaviors and choices have.
9259.2 But with that said, if
you are in the age bracket
9262.29 that I've been referring to,
9263.31 this 14 to 25 year old age bracket,
9265.74 and you are a occasional even
or chronic cannabis user,
9270.63 you should be very, very
careful and concerned
9274.08 about the long-term effects
9275.46 that that could potentially have.
9276.99 That statement is bolstered
by another statistic,
9279.42 which is that unlike a lot of other drugs,
9283.92 the rate of cannabis
use is strongly related
9287.64 to how dangerous people
perceive cannabis to be.
9292.242 Now, that might seem
obvious, on the one hand,
9294.78 if you think something
is very, very dangerous,
9297.3 you would expect that the probability
9298.89 that somebody would use it
would be very, very low,
9301.05 and if they think something is safe,
9302.13 the probability would be high.
9304.56 But that isn't necessarily the case.
9306.66 If you think about it,
cannabis is a unique instance
9310.53 in which nowadays we are hearing,
9312.96 yes, it's becoming legal
in a number of areas,
9315.39 and we talked earlier about why
that's probably a good thing
9317.64 in most circumstances,
9319.32 but that we aren't just
hearing that cannabis is safe,
9322.38 or it's not just being implied
that cannabis is safer,
9326.01 but many more people are talking
9328.11 about the positive effects of cannabis
9330.491 without a lot of discussion
9332.4 about the negative effects of cannabis.
9334.38 And I realize that saying this
9335.88 is going to upset some people out there,
9337.38 because I know that there
are a number of people
9338.79 who fought very hard for
the legalization process,
9341.13 and I want to acknowledge that.
9342.93 I also want to acknowledge the
many known positive effects
9347.73 of cannabis in adults
with very occasional use,
9352.56 provided it is delivered
safely and in the safe context
9357.12 and setting and with legality.
9359.58 That is entirely distinct from the issue
9362.04 of whether or not cannabis is safe
9363.51 for the developing brain and body.
9365.76 Again, I'm not demonizing
anybody for using cannabis,
9369.211 but I want to make the point
very simply and very directly.
9372.78 It is far and away a different
circumstance for the brain
9378.27 for an individual to be 25 years or older
9381.96 and using cannabis in whatever form,
9385.26 occasionally or maybe even frequently,
9387.78 than it is for a young
person, aged 14 to 25,
9393.09 to be using cannabis,
either by smoking or vaping
9396.231 or by edible or any other
form, on the brain and body.
9401.28 It's absolutely clear that
the brain continues to develop
9404.28 at least until age 25, and
that a huge number of systems
9408.0 related to mood regulation,
so-called executive function,
9411.33 the ability to organize one's thoughts,
9413.07 plan and execute plans,
9415.53 essentially to become a
functional human being,
9418.11 that's one portion of becoming
a functional human being,
9420.54 but certainly an essential one.
9422.67 All of that relies on the fine tuning
9425.04 of this neural circuitry
9426.416 that we've been talking
about up until now,
9429.72 and it's abundantly clear that cannabis
9433.59 and THC in particular, dramatically
disrupt those processes.
9440.22 So if this isn't clear enough,
just from my statements,
9443.97 I'd like to point to a particular paper.
9446.04 This is one of the more impactful papers
9447.66 in this area in recent years.
9449.67 This is a paper published in
"Lancet Psychiatry" in 2022.
9453.72 Title is "Association of Cannabis Potency
9456.667 "with Mental Ill Health and
Addiction, A Systematic Review."
9460.39 There are a number of
very important points
9461.97 in this very fine paper.
9463.717 "Lancet Psychiatry" is one of the premier
9466.26 medical journals out there,
9468.54 and they evaluated a
huge number of studies.
9471.45 They actually looked at
more than 4,000 studies.
9474.45 They selected the ones that
were only the most rigorous
9477.6 in terms of study design and analysis
9480.48 and rigor of conclusions, and
they looked at how early use
9485.43 of cannabis impacted later
probability of development
9489.96 of psychosis and other
psychiatric conditions,
9492.96 and the takeaways from
this study are very clear.
9496.65 First of all, chronic cannabis use,
9499.86 so more than twice per
week, has consistently
9502.41 been associated with
mental health disorders.
9504.39 I'm pulling some phrases
directly from the paper.
9506.97 Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis use
9510.42 more frequent than twice per week,
9512.836 has been associated
with four times the risk
9515.76 of psychosis later in life, in particular,
9517.89 schizophrenia and bipolar-like episodes.
9520.74 Now, we've done an episode
on bipolar disorder.
9523.119 It's also called bipolar depression.
9524.7 We have not yet done one on schizophrenia,
9526.26 but both bipolar disorder
and schizophrenia
9528.84 have a very, very strong
genetic component.
9531.9 There's a 30, three-zero,
30 times greater likelihood
9535.38 that you'll have bipolar disorder
9536.61 if you have a first relative
who has bipolar disorder.
9539.46 And then, it's also the
case that using cannabis,
9543.03 especially during adolescents
and the teen years,
9545.79 and up until age 25,
9547.47 create a four times
greater risk of psychosis
9550.469 for those that have a predisposition
9552.6 to bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia.
9555.9 Now, I don't hear very much
about this in the media.
9558.72 This paper got some attention
and then it got swept away.
9562.83 I don't think that was an
intentional sweeping way.
9564.48 There's just a lot of events
in the world as you well know.
9567.81 But I think it's a particularly
important set of findings,
9571.2 because obviously, in
looking at so many studies,
9574.98 it distills out the strongest
findings that are out there
9577.32 and really pulls the consistent messages
9580.62 that are arriving from all
these different studies.
9582.72 And as they point out, and
again, I'm paraphrasing here,
9585.671 this is the first systematic review
9587.61 of the association of cannabis potency,
9590.85 and all of the data point
to a very clear conclusion,
9593.34 which is the more potent
the THC concentration,
9598.14 the higher probability
of developing psychosis
9600.69 or a major depressive episode
9602.22 or a major anxiety disorder later in life.
9604.65 That should be of particular
concern, because we know,
9608.85 we are absolutely clear about the fact
9611.31 that with the advent of all
these new strains of cannabis,
9614.76 and with the engineering
and availability of cannabis
9619.56 at much higher potency,
meaning THC potency,
9624.09 the risk of psychosis is going up and up
9627.0 and is likely to continue going
up unless something is done
9629.61 to reduce the frequency of
cannabis use to zero, ideally,
9636.12 or to very low frequency, very low potency
9639.21 in adolescence and teens and
people age 25 or younger.
9643.65 I know a lot of people don't
want to hear this message,
9645.9 because first of all, it's alarming,
9647.22 and second of all, as I mentioned earlier,
9649.83 the statistics tell us that
the greatest number of people
9653.19 that are starting to use cannabis
9654.54 are in the age bracket of 16 to 24.
9658.23 Many of them are functional
in other areas of life.
9660.39 They're students, they
are employed, et cetera.
9663.78 But when you couple that with the fact
9665.88 that the most frequent
adopters of cannabis use
9668.58 are in this age bracket of 16 to 24,
9671.31 they're twice as likely to
use as other individuals
9674.67 or to start using cannabis
as are other individuals.
9677.52 Plus, the general perception out there,
9679.53 because of the way that
cannabis is discussed
9681.9 in the media and by sports
figures and by celebrities
9684.81 and by politicians, et cetera,
9687.27 that it's not as bad as
alcohol and maybe not that bad
9690.96 and maybe even has health benefits,
9693.63 then you're essentially
setting up a system
9695.04 where young people are far more likely
9697.08 to adopt and continue cannabis use
9699.178 without realizing these
serious health consequences
9702.69 that await them later.
9705.3 With all of that said, I, of course,
9707.79 again want to acknowledge
that there have been
9711.51 well-demonstrated effects of
cannabis for reducing pain,
9716.94 in particular in chemotherapy
and in the context
9720.18 of reducing nausea in people suffering
9723.0 from cancer or chemotherapy.
9724.83 There is a well-known effect
9727.133 that one can generally
point to as positive,
9730.02 using cannabis for things like glaucoma,
9733.44 for lowering intraocular pressure
9735.72 and offsetting the loss of neurons
9737.22 that would lead to blindness,
9738.27 although there are other tools, of course,
9739.68 that don't involve cannabis use
9741.27 that can accomplish that as well,
9743.61 so called intraocular pressure
lowering drugs or drops.
9748.47 There is a list of probably
a dozen or more psychological
9754.02 and bodily ailments that can
be aided by cannabis use,
9757.64 in particular edible cannabis
use of particular strains.
9762.15 I, of course, am going to address each
9764.25 and every one of those in
episodes where I'm talking,
9767.55 for instance, about eye
disease or about chronic pain.
9771.09 I am in no way, shape or form
9772.86 trying to rob the incredible
efforts of the laboratories
9776.58 and people that have worked very hard
9778.256 to study and establish
the valid uses of cannabis
9782.73 for treating various ailments
9784.35 and that continue to study
cannabis in order to try
9787.2 and ameliorate the symptoms
of different ailments.
9790.493 But today, I really wanted
9791.91 to emphasize the biology of cannabis,
9795.0 some of the often discussed effects,
9798.24 I guess one could call
them positive effects,
9799.71 things like enhanced creativity
9800.97 and really point to the nuance
and actually the divergence
9803.677 of people who take cannabis
and some experience
9807.48 heightened levels of
creativity and some do not.
9809.55 Some people experience heightened
levels of sexual arousal
9813.54 and some people experience
the exact opposite,
9816.42 and so on and so forth,
9817.89 rather than focus on all
the potential positive
9820.68 and emerging positive data about cannabis
9824.1 in different medical contexts.
9825.78 And at the same time, I strongly
feel that it's important
9828.51 to acknowledge the shocking,
9831.436 because there's really no
other way to describe it,
9834.33 the shocking effects of cannabis
use on the developing fetus
9838.86 and the fact that so many pregnant
9841.08 and lactating mothers are using cannabis.
9843.24 I mean, that number 15% still
has me dizzy with disbelief,
9847.53 and yet we need to acknowledge this
9848.85 and address this immediately.
9851.37 And I think it's vital to
understand that cannabis use
9855.33 through any delivery mechanism,
9859.02 smoking or vaping or edible or otherwise,
9862.14 is very, very concerning,
9864.72 in fact, dangerous to
the developing brain,
9866.88 certainly for the fetal
brain and for the baby brain,
9870.196 but also for the adolescent brain
9872.64 and for the teen and young adult brain,
9875.61 not just because of the effects
9876.84 that it can have in the immediate term,
9878.31 those slow creeping increases
in anxiety and depression,
9881.46 brought on by cannabis use,
9883.77 but also the time release, if you will,
9887.586 on the development of
psychosis and other types
9891.12 of major psychiatric
disorders later in life.
9894.27 I acknowledge we've covered
a lot of ground today,
9896.46 and yet there's still far more ground
9898.23 that we could have covered
9899.16 and that we will indeed
cover in future episodes.

9956.16 Not so much today, but
in many previous episodes
9958.32 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
we talk about supplements.
9960.72 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
9962.91 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them
9964.95 for things like enhancing sleep and focus
9966.93 and hormone optimization.
9968.61 The Huberman Lab Podcast
9969.63 has partnered with Momentous supplements.
