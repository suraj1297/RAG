0.34 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
1.94 where we discuss science
3.75 and science-based tools for everyday life.
5.827 [upbeat music]
9.22 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.21 and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
13.06 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.01 Today, we are going to discuss
the science and practice
17.6 of flexibility and stretching.
19.78 Flexibility and stretching
are topics that I believe
22.05 do not receive nearly as much
attention as they deserve.
25.37 For most people, the topics
of flexibility and stretching
27.71 bring to mind things like yoga,
30.2 injury prevention, or
maybe even contortionism.
33.03 But it turns out that
flexibility and stretching
35.34 are features that are built
into our basic body plan.
39.09 Young children, young animals, and adults,
42.29 and, indeed, older children and animals
44.88 all stretch and all have
some degree of flexibility.
48.68 It turns out that having flexibility,
50.49 and our ability to stretch,
52.15 and the interaction between
stretching and flexibility
55.19 are fundamental to how we move,
57.72 our ability to learn new movements,
59.96 indeed also to prevent
injury or repair injuries,
64.17 and to offsetting and
reducing inflammation
67.12 throughout the body.
67.953 In fact, today I'm going to share with you
69.53 a remarkable set of studies
that show that stretching
72.41 can actually adjust
things like tumor growth.
75.61 This is work that was done
by one of the major directors
77.76 of the National Institutes of Health.
79.67 So, today's discussion will start
81.18 with a description of the mechanisms,
83.74 literally the cells
84.9 and the connections
from your nervous system
86.67 that mediate flexibility and stretching.
88.95 And I promise that I'll make
89.98 that information accessible to you
91.99 whether or not you have a
biology background or not.
94.86 Then with that information in hand,
96.7 I'm going to present to you
what the scientific literature
98.82 says about the best times
and ways to stretch,
102.01 everything right down to the detail
103.3 of how long to hold a stretch,
105.23 whether or not to hold a stretch at all
106.64 because it turns out there are
multiple kinds of stretching.
108.917 So, you can imagine you have stretches
110.43 where you hold the stretch
for a very long time
113.1 and use as little momentum as possible,
114.967 and then there's also
what's called dynamic
117.01 and ballistic stretching
117.95 where you're literally swinging your limbs
119.77 trying to increase the range of motion.
121.73 I will explain the science and application
123.52 of flexibility and stretching
124.59 in the context of sports performance,
127.33 whether or not you are engaging
in cardiovascular exercise,
129.96 or resistance exercise, or both,
132.46 whether or not you're
a competitive athlete
133.96 or simply a recreational
exerciser, as I am,
137.41 whether or not you are
trying to increase your range
140.0 of motion and flexibility
for longevity purposes,
142.56 or whether or not you're trying to do it
144.08 in order to access different
parts of your nervous system
146.74 'cause we'll soon learn today
148.4 that your ability to improve flexibility
151.52 and, indeed, to engage in
specific stretching exercises
155.0 can actually be used
to powerfully modulate
157.31 your ability to tolerate pain,
159.27 both emotional and physical pain.
161.36 So, this thing that we call
flexibility and stretching
164.02 is actually a vast landscape.
165.8 We're going to simplify and
organize all that for you today
168.43 and by the end of today's episode,
170.12 you're going to have a number
of simple, easy-to-apply tools
173.14 that are grounded in the
best scientific research
175.48 that you can apply for
your specific goals.
178.08 Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast
180.79 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
183.78 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
185.93 to bring zero-cost to consumer information
187.89 about science and science-related tools
190.17 to the general public.
191.66 In keeping with that theme,
192.7 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
195.52 Our first sponsor is Thesis.
197.56 Thesis makes custom nootropics
199.23 that are designed to
get your brain and body
201.02 into the optimal state for the
cognitive and physical things
204.29 that you need to perform
at the highest level.
206.8 I have to confess, in fact
I've said it many times before,
209.52 I am not a fan of the word nootropics
211.27 because it means smart drugs.
213.19 And frankly, as a neuroscientist,
215.42 I'd be remiss If I didn't acknowledge
217.16 that there's really no
circuit in your brain
218.79 for being smart,
219.8 you have neural circuits in
your brain that are designed
222.64 to get you to focus very well,
or to task switch very well,
225.98 or to be creative.
227.48 Thesis understands this,
228.79 and as a consequence
they've designed nootropics
230.86 that are tailored to your specific needs
233.19 in the cognitive and physical realm.
235.2 What I mean by that is if
you go to the Thesis site,
237.95 you fill out a short quiz,
239.46 and they'll give you the opportunity
240.78 to try a small kit of different nootropics
243.01 with different ingredients.
244.31 You have the opportunity to
try several different blends
247.04 over the course of the month
248.05 and discover which nootropics works best
249.81 for your unique brain
chemistry and genetics.
252.5 I've been using Thesis
253.52 for about eight and a half months now,
255.41 and I can confidently
say that their nootropics
257.3 have been a game changer.
259.23 To get your own personalized
nootropic starter kit,
261.22 you can go online to
takethesis.com/huberman.
264.85 There you'll find that three-minute quiz
266.31 and Thesis will send you
four different formulas
268.11 to try in your first month.

275.75 Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
279.015 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
281.5 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
284.22 to help you better understand your body
285.82 and help you reach your health goals.
287.96 I've long been a believer in
getting regular bloodwork done
290.75 for the simple reason
that many of the factors
293.3 that impact your immediate
and long-term health
295.84 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
299.16 One issue with a lot of blood
tests and DNA tests out there
302.15 is that you get information
back about hormone levels,
304.93 metabolic factors, et cetera,
307.07 but you don't know what to
do with that information.
309.003 InsideTracker has a very easy
to use personalized platform
313.05 that lets you look at those numbers
314.75 and then you can
literally move your cursor
317.11 over those numbers and there
are little popup windows
320.56 that will tell you the
things that you can do
322.45 in terms of lifestyle,
323.64 so exercise, and nutrition,
supplementation, and so on
327.51 to bring those numbers into the ranges
329.27 that are optimal for you.
330.68 So, it really takes all the
guesswork out of what to do
333.6 with that bloodwork and DNA information.

353.07 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
355.91 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
357.66 that have cooling, heating,
and sleep tracking capacity.
360.5 And, indeed, you can dial in,
362.28 you can literally program
363.73 the temperature of your
sleeping environment
366.05 from the time you go to sleep
367.11 until the time you wake up in the morning.
369.33 This turns out to be immensely powerful
371.27 because as I've talked
about on the podcast before,
373.92 in order to fall asleep
and stay deeply asleep
376.4 throughout the night,
377.65 your body has to drop by
about one to three degrees,
381.07 and waking up in the morning
382.54 actually involves a warming
up of your body temperature.
386.17 For many people, they just
can't precisely control
389.04 their sleep environment well enough
390.41 in order for all that to go well.
392.29 I was one such person.
393.38 So, for a long time I'd
fall asleep pretty easily,
395.95 but then I'd wake up in
the middle of the night,
397.94 I tended to run warm,
399.4 but then sometimes I'd feel
really tired in the morning
401.76 as if I couldn't wake up.
403.38 I started sleeping on an
Eight Sleep mattress cover.
405.76 I programmed it so that the temperature
407.53 would be rather cool in the
early part of the evening
409.55 when I would get into bed
410.68 and then would drop into the
deeper phases of the night
413.41 when I was entering deep sleep
415.27 and then rapid eye movement sleep,
417.37 and then would warm towards morning,
418.95 it would help me wake up quickly.
420.16 And as a consequence,
420.993 I'm sleeping throughout the night now
422.81 and I'm waking up feeling
completely refreshed.
425.17 If you'd like to try an
Eight Sleep mattress cover,

442.72 Let's talk about
flexibility and stretching.
445.51 Before we talk about the practices
447.28 of flexibility and stretching,
448.817 I'd like to just highlight
some of the features
450.85 that are already built
into your nervous system
453.07 and into your body that
allow you to be flexible.
456.6 Some of us feel tighter than others,
458.91 sometimes in specific
limbs or areas of our body,
462.0 some people feel really loose and limb,
464.44 some people even have what's
called a hyper-flexibility.
467.78 I, for instance, have a relative
that can take her fingers
470.44 and bend them back to the point
where they touch her wrist.
473.4 And it always makes me
cringe a little bit,
476.1 but she can do that without any pain,
477.5 she seems to have some
hyper-flexibility in her joints.
479.56 I do not have that feature.
481.32 Some of you may find that
you are more flexible
483.15 than others naturally,
484.55 and some of you might be thinking
486.49 you don't need to build
in additional flexibility.
488.94 Well, I think by the
end of today's episode,
491.68 you'll realize that almost
all of us can benefit
494.28 from having some sort of
understanding about flexibility
497.28 and having some stretching protocol
499.41 that we incorporate into our life,
501.44 if not just for physical
performance reasons
504.45 and for postural reasons,
506.06 then also for cognitive
and mental reasons,
509.6 and I'll be sure to clarify
what all of that means.
513.07 Right now, I'd like to take a moment
514.3 and just highlight the
flexibility that you already have.
517.42 For instance, if you were to move your arm
520.45 behind your torso a little bit
522.13 and then sort of let go
524.34 or stop exerting any effort in doing that,
527.58 you would find that the limb would return
529.52 more or less to a position
next to your torso,
531.45 at least I would hope so.
532.61 And why is that?
534.48 Well, it turns out that there are aspects
536.06 of your nervous system, aspects
of your skeletal system,
540.23 aspects of your muscles,
541.94 and aspects of the connective tissue
544.16 that binds all of that together,
546.71 that try and restore a particular order
549.35 or position to your limbs
551.71 and your limbs relative to one another.
554.29 So, that reflects a very
specific set of processes
557.58 that it turns out are
the same set of processes
560.12 that you use when you are trying
561.44 to enhance flexibility and stretching.
564.15 So, I'd like to just take a moment
565.84 and review the basic
elements of nervous system,
569.89 muscle, connective tissue,
and skeletal tissue, bone,
574.66 that allow for flexibility and stretching.
578.06 And here we can point
to two major mechanisms
580.88 by which your nervous system,
582.62 neurons, meaning nerve cells,
584.56 communicate with muscles,
586.55 and those muscles communicate
back to your nervous system
590.24 to make sure that your
limbs don't stretch too far,
592.89 they don't move too far
such that you get injured.
596.54 And in addition to that,
598.72 mechanisms that ensure that
you don't overload your muscles
601.84 too much with weight, or
with tension, or with effort
605.18 and damage them that way.
606.73 'Cause it turns out that the
second security mechanism
609.87 of making sure that you
don't overload muscles
611.95 can be leveraged toward
613.27 increasing your flexibility
almost immediately.
616.67 That's right, there
are protocols and tools
618.73 that I'll share with you
that are going to allow you
620.45 to vastly improve your
flexibility over time.
625.0 But there are also
mechanisms that allow you
626.78 to quite significantly increase
your degree of flexibility
630.93 in a very short period of time,
632.77 and within just a few seconds.
634.42 So, let's establish some of the
basic biological mechanisms.
638.45 Any time we talk about
biology or physiology,
640.95 we're going to talk about structure,
642.56 meaning the cells and their connections,
644.24 and functions, what they do.
646.35 There are just a few names to understand,
647.94 you do not have to memorize these names.
650.29 The important thing that
I'd like you to know
652.12 is that flexibility and
the process of stretching
654.6 and getting more flexible
involves three major components,
658.82 neural, meaning of the nervous system,
661.23 muscular, muscles, and connective tissue.
664.31 Connective tissue is the stuff
665.53 that surrounds the neural
stuff and the muscular stuff,
669.45 although it's all kind of weaved together
671.11 and braided together in complicated ways.
673.38 Some of you may have heard of fascia.
675.03 We're going to talk a little
bit about fascia today,
676.76 although it's such an interesting tissue
679.04 that's really deserving
of its own episode.
682.009 Fascial tissue, we're going to
talk about some of the stuff
684.6 that surrounds muscles that
really gives you your shape,
687.44 and holds everything together,
688.74 and allows for flexibility to occur.
691.47 So, here's a key thing
that everyone should know
693.75 whether or not you're talking
about flexibility or not.
697.16 Your nervous system controls your muscles,
700.24 it's what gets your muscles to contract.
702.78 So, within your spinal cord,
704.32 you have a category of
neurons, nerve cells,
706.94 that are called motor neurons.
708.98 To be precise, they
are lower motor neurons
711.2 'cause they're in your spinal cord.
713.53 We call them lower to distinguish them
715.09 from the motor neurons
that are in your brain
717.7 up in your skull.
720.06 Those lower motor neurons,
721.97 hereafter I'll just refer
to them as motor neurons.
724.87 If I want to talk about the
other kind of motor neurons,
726.71 I'll say upper motor neurons.
727.76 So, if I say motor neurons,
728.81 I just mean the ones in your spinal cord.
730.9 Those motor neurons send a little wire
734.26 or set of wires out to your muscles,
737.06 and that creates what's called
a neuromuscular junction,
740.42 which just means that the
neurons meet the muscles
742.39 at a particular place.
743.93 Those neurons release a chemical,
745.92 that chemical is called acetylcholine.
749.02 Some of you may have heard
about acetylcholine before,
751.12 acetylcholine also exists in your brain
753.66 and does other things in your brain,
755.15 mainly it's involved
in focus and attention.
758.2 But at the neuromuscular junction,
760.23 the release of acetylcholine
from these nerve cells,
763.16 these neurons, onto the muscles
765.01 causes the muscles to contract.
766.82 And when muscles contract,
767.96 they are able to move limbs
771.77 by way of changing the
length of the muscle,
775.99 adjusting the function
of connective tissue
779.09 like tendons and ligaments.
780.63 And for instance,
781.57 if you're bringing your wrist
closer to your shoulder,
784.07 that biceps muscle is
contracting, it's getting shorter.
788.2 I mean, in reality it hasn't
gotten shorter overall,
790.7 it's just temporarily shorter, of course.
793.17 All of that is controlled by neurons.
795.96 And it's those motor
neurons from the spinal cord
798.75 that are really responsible
for the major movement
801.75 of your limbs by way
of causing contraction
805.5 of specific muscles at specific times.
807.67 So, the key thing to
take away is that nerve
810.56 controls the contraction of muscles.
813.4 Now, within the muscles themselves,
816.45 there are nerve connections.
819.34 And these are nerve connections that arise
821.44 from a different set of
neurons in the spinal cord
823.54 that we call sensory neurons.
825.78 The sensory neurons
827.26 exist in a different
part of the spinal cord,
829.39 and they send a low wire or
set of wires into the muscles.
833.1 And there's a particular
kind of sensory neuron
835.88 that comes out of your spinal
cord and into your muscles,
838.44 which are called spindle neurons.
841.9 They create or they actually
wrap around muscle fibers,
846.41 kind of corkscrew around them
848.05 and give kind of a spring-like appearance.
850.12 And for you aficionados out there,
852.18 these are intrafusal
connections or neurons.
855.91 Intrafusal means within the muscle,
858.08 but you really don't need to know that
859.87 unless you're really curious about it,
861.77 or you're going to
become a neuroscientist,
863.11 or you're in medical school or something.
865.37 These spindle connections
within the muscle
869.87 that wrap around the muscle fibers
871.62 sense the stretch of those muscle fibers.
875.83 So, now we have two parts to
the system that I've described.
879.3 You've got motor neurons
880.36 that can cause muscles
to contract and shorten,
883.45 and we have these spindles
within the muscles themselves
888.24 that wrap around the muscle fibers,
890.27 and that information
is sent from the muscle
893.21 back to the spinal cord.
895.18 It's a form of sensing what's
going on in the muscle.
898.79 Much in the same way that
you have neurons in your eye
901.13 that sense light in your
external environment,
903.98 you have neurons in your
ear that sense sound waves
906.87 in your external environment,
908.35 you have neurons in your spinal cord
910.76 that are sensory neurons
912.18 that are sensing the amount
of stretch in the muscles.
916.57 What happens is if a given
muscle is stretching really far,
921.12 those sensory neurons, those
spindles within the muscle
924.89 will activate and will send
a electrical potential,
928.9 literally a bit of electricity
930.6 along that wire's length
into the spinal cord.
933.42 And then, within the spinal cord
935.19 that sensory neuron communicates
937.52 through a series of intermediate steps,
939.17 but to the motor neuron
942.21 and makes sure that that
motor neuron contracts.
945.22 Now, why would that be useful?
946.72 Well, what this does is
it creates a situation
949.27 where if a muscle is or
is stretching too much
952.63 because the range of motion of
a limb is increased too much
956.8 then the muscle will contract
958.49 to bring that limb range of
motion into a safe range again.
963.78 Now, what determines whether
or not a range of motion
966.17 is quote-unquote safe or not
968.32 is dictated by a number of things.
970.16 It's dictated by things that are happening
971.76 in this kind of loop of neural connections
973.76 in the spinal cord and muscle.
975.19 It's also determined by
what's going on in your head,
978.45 literally in your mind cognitively
980.17 about whether or not the
movement of that limb
982.67 its increasing range of
motion is good for you,
985.46 whether or not you're
doing it deliberately,
987.16 whether or not it's bad for you.
988.19 And then there are also
some basic safety mechanisms
991.39 that are put in there that
really try and restrict
993.84 our limb range of motion.
995.83 Okay, so just to clarify,
997.61 this whole thing looks like a loop,
999.09 and the essential components of the loop
1000.67 are motor neurons contract muscles,
1004.81 sensory neurons, of
which there are a bunch
1007.14 of different varieties,
1007.973 well, in this case, what
we're calling the spindles
1009.59 are sensing stretch within the muscles.
1011.6 And if a given muscle is elongating
1015.12 because of the increased
range of motion of a limb,
1018.81 those sensory neurons
send an electrical signal
1021.11 into the spinal cord
1022.44 such that there is an
activation of the motor neuron,
1025.57 which by now should make perfect sense
1027.72 as to why that's useful.
1028.73 It then shortens up the muscle.
1030.72 It actually doesn't
really shorten the muscle,
1031.99 but it contracts the muscle
1033.09 that brings the limb back
into a safe range of motion.
1037.11 Okay, so this process is very fast,
1041.5 it was designed to keep
your body together and safe.
1045.97 It's designed to make sure
that you don't take your arm
1048.61 and swing it behind your torso
1049.86 and it just goes all the way back
1050.98 to the middle of your back.
1051.88 I mean, unless you're a contortionist
1053.14 or you've trained that kind
of level of flexibility,
1055.59 that would be terrible
1056.423 because it could provide a
lot of damage to the muscles,
1060.01 and to the connective
tissue, and so forth.
1062.92 So, that's one basic mechanism
that we want to hold in mind,
1066.42 this idea of a spindle that senses stretch
1068.53 and can activate
contraction of the muscles
1070.52 and shorten the muscles.
1071.78 The next mechanism I want to describe,
1073.67 and once again there are only two
1075.37 that you need to hold in
mind for this episode.
1078.36 This other mechanism has
a lot of the same features
1081.03 as the one I just described,
1082.68 but it has less to do with stretch,
1084.82 in fact, it doesn't
have to do with stretch
1086.21 as much as it has to
do with sensing loads.
1089.77 So, at the end of each muscles
you have tendons typically,
1094.57 and there are neurons that
are closely associated
1099.65 with those tendons
1101.18 that are called Golgi
tendon organs, right?
1103.69 These are neurons that are sensory neurons
1106.44 that sense how much load
is on a given muscle.
1109.3 Right, so if you're lifting
up something very, very heavy,
1111.97 these neurons are going to fire,
1113.73 meaning they're going to
send electrical activity
1115.33 into the spinal cord.
1116.67 And then, those neurons have
the ability to shut down,
1121.17 not activate, but shut down motor neurons
1124.32 and to prevent the
contraction of a given muscle.
1127.83 So, for instance, if you were to walk over
1129.75 and try and pick up a weight
that is much too heavy for you,
1133.92 meaning you could not do it
without injuring yourself
1136.47 and you start to try and heave
that weight off the ground.
1140.46 There are a number of reasons
1141.43 why you might not be able to lift it,
1142.68 but let's say you start to get it
1143.75 a little bit off the ground,
1144.97 or you start to get some force generated
1148.38 that would allow it to move.
1150.3 But the force that you're generating
1152.59 could potentially rip your
muscles or your tendons
1155.44 off of the bone,
1156.7 right, that it could disrupt the joints
1158.067 and it could tear ligaments.
1160.03 Well, you have a safety
mechanism in place,
1161.77 it's these Golgi tendon organs,
1163.08 these GTOs, as they're called,
1165.27 they get activated and
shut down the motor neurons
1167.62 and make it impossible for
those muscles to contract.
1170.92 Okay, so on the one hand,
1171.88 we have a mechanism that senses stretch
1173.76 and can figure out when
stretch is excessive.
1176.75 And when this system detects
that stretch is excessive,
1180.46 it activates the contraction of muscles.
1184.37 And then, we have a second
mechanism that senses loads,
1187.6 and when tension or
loads is deemed excessive
1191.18 by these circuits,
1192.13 and remember these
circuits don't have a mind,
1193.5 they don't go, "Oh, this is excessive,"
1195.06 they just sense loads.
1196.24 And when those loads
exceed a certain threshold,
1198.65 well then those GTOs,
those Golgi tendon organs,
1202.03 send signals into the spinal cord
1203.45 that shut down your motor neuron's ability
1206.37 to contract muscle so that
you no longer can lift
1208.67 that heavy load.
1209.76 So, both of these are
protective mechanisms,
1212.26 but both of these can be
leveraged in a very logical way
1216.21 and in a very safe way
1217.49 in order to increase your
limb range of motion.
1220.25 So, there are a couple of
things I want to point out
1222.03 before going a little bit further
1224.17 into how your nervous system
1225.89 controls flexibility and stretching,
1228.28 and those key points are the following.
1231.0 There are now dozens if
not hundreds of studies
1234.25 that show that a dedicated
stretching practice
1238.87 can improve limb range of motion.
1241.24 Now, for many of you listening,
1242.6 you're probably saying, "Duh,"
1244.0 but I think it's important
to point that out,
1246.33 that a dedicated stretching practice
1248.25 can increase limb range of motion.
1250.6 And as you'll soon learn,
1252.02 there are specific mechanisms
that can explain that effect.
1255.15 The second point is one of longevity.
1257.61 And when I say longevity,
1259.01 I don't necessarily mean late-stage aging.
1262.35 We all undergo a decrease
in limb range of motion,
1266.27 unless we do something
to offset that decrease.
1269.15 And the current numbers
vary from study to study,
1271.78 but if you look en masse,
1273.38 you look at all of those studies
1274.64 and what you basically find
1276.02 is that we start to experience
a decrease in flexibility
1279.72 from about age 20 until about
age 49 that's pretty dramatic.
1284.56 And then, of course, it
will continue after age 49,
1287.7 but basically it's a 10%
decrease every 10 years.
1291.0 So, we could say it's
a 1% decrease per year,
1293.76 although it's not necessarily linear.
1295.56 What do I mean by that?
1296.393 Well, it's not necessarily
that on your 21st birthday,
1299.65 you are 1% less flexible
1301.72 than you were on your 20th birthday
1303.17 and it decreased by 1% per year,
1305.29 some of these changes can be non-linear.
1307.21 So, you can imagine the person
1308.25 who's doing just fine
in terms of flexibility
1310.72 between 20 and 30,
1311.86 and then they get to 32
1313.96 and suddenly they've lost
5% of their flexibility.
1316.25 Now, of course, there will be
a ton of lifestyle factors.
1318.81 If you're a regular practitioner of yoga,
1320.61 if you have a dedicated
stretching practice,
1322.39 if you're doing other things
1323.42 to improve your muscle contractibility,
1325.88 so you're doing resistance training
1327.41 it turns out can actually
indirectly improve flexibility.
1331.77 There are a number of different factors,
1333.4 but the key point is that maintaining
1335.86 some degree of flexibility
1337.46 and maybe even enhancing range
of motion and flexibility
1341.42 is of immense benefit
for offsetting injury
1343.97 provided it's not pushed too far.
1346.74 There are a number of people
1347.69 who have pushed their limb range of motion
1350.07 so far that they experience
all sorts of injuries,
1353.86 both acute and chronic injuries.
1355.54 Today, we'll also talk about
how to avoid those scenarios.
1358.47 Okay, so we've established
that there are mechanisms
1360.2 within the spinal cord,
muscles, and connective tissue,
1362.77 those remember it's the motor neurons,
1365.13 the spindles, the GTOs,
1367.14 and, of course, the muscles themselves,
1369.41 and connective tissue, tendons,
1371.81 but also other forms of connective tissue
1374.23 that establish whether or not a limb
1377.12 is going to stay within a
particular range of motion or not,
1379.94 and whether or not a limb
is going to be allowed
1383.22 by the nervous system to pursue
1386.07 or handle a given load, a given tension.
1389.84 There are also mechanisms that arrive
1392.54 to the neuromuscular system
1394.77 from higher up in the nervous
system, from the brain.
1398.16 And those mechanisms involve
a couple of different facets
1401.1 that are really interesting,
1403.08 and I think that we should all know about.
1405.01 In fact, today, I'm going to
teach you about a set of neurons
1407.33 that I'm guessing 99.9% of
you have never heard of,
1410.65 including all you
neuroscientists out there,
1412.96 if you're out there, and
I know you're out there,
1416.46 that seem uniquely enriched in humans
1420.58 and probably perform essential roles
1423.3 in our ability to regulate our physiology
1425.48 and our emotional state.
1427.07 So, within the brain,
1428.17 we have the ability to sense
things in the external world,
1431.34 something we called exteroception,
1433.37 and we have the ability to sense things
1435.08 in our internal world within
our body, called interoception.
1438.68 Interoception can be the
volume of food in your gut,
1441.38 whether or not you're experiencing
1442.52 any organ pain or discomfort,
1444.18 whether or not you feel good
in your gut and in your organs,
1446.62 that's actually a kind of
feeling, "Hmm, I feel great,
1448.85 I feel sated, I feel relaxed,"
1450.96 but those are all different
forms of interoception.
1454.01 The main brain area that's associated
1456.47 with interpreting what's
going on in our body
1458.56 is called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.
1461.27 It's a very interesting brain region,
1462.81 it's got two major parts.
1464.17 The front of it is mainly
concerned with things like smell,
1469.82 and to some extent vision, and
to some extent other things
1473.7 that are arriving from the external world
1476.23 and combining with what's
going on internally
1479.03 and making sense of all that,
1481.14 or at least routing that
information elsewhere
1483.16 in your nervous system to make decision,
1484.74 like if you smell something
good to approach it,
1486.5 or if you smell something bad to avoid it.
1488.28 The front of the insula is really doing
1490.27 all of that kind of stuff
along with other brain areas.
1493.75 The posterior insula, the
back of the insula that is,
1497.87 has a very interesting and
distinct set of functions.
1501.8 The posterior insula is mainly concerned
1504.42 with what's going on with
your somatic experience.
1508.01 How do you feel internally?
1509.49 And how is the movement
that you happen to be doing
1514.91 combining with your internal state
1517.59 to allow you to feel,
1519.16 as I like to say the nervous
system mainly batches things
1522.12 into yum, like, "Oh, this
is really good for me,"
1525.06 yuck, "This is really bad
for me and I need to stop,"
1527.63 or meh, "This is kind of neutral."
1529.76 Okay, so this isn't about food,
1531.33 but we could say for most stimuli,
1533.44 most senses, whether or not they're senses
1535.5 of things internally or externally,
1537.58 our nervous system is
trying to make decisions
1539.4 about what to do with that information,
1540.84 and so it mainly batches
information into yum,
1543.39 I want to keep doing this
or approach this thing,
1546.1 or continue down some path
of movement, or eating,
1550.52 or staying in a temperature
environment, et cetera,
1553.61 or yuck, I need to get out of here,
1555.27 I don't want any more of this,
1556.4 I don't want to keep doing this,
1557.44 this is painful, or
aversive, or stressful.
1560.0 And then meh, so if it
doesn't really matter,
1562.2 I can just kind of stay right here or not.
1563.76 Yum, yuck, and meh.
1565.46 Well, in your posterior insula,
1569.9 you have a very interesting population
1571.99 of very large neurons,
1573.54 these are exceptionally large neurons
1576.03 called von Economo neurons.
1578.75 These are neurons that are, again,
1581.18 unbeknownst to most neuroscientists
1582.97 and they seem uniquely enriched in humans.
1586.43 Chimpanzees have them
1588.08 and some other large animals have them.
1590.27 So, they're found in whales,
1592.23 chimpanzees, elephants, and in humans.
1595.61 But even though we are much
smaller than most whales
1598.69 and even though we are much
smaller than most elephants,
1601.59 I mean, remember there are baby elephants.
1603.51 As far as I know, they haven't bred up
1605.52 like mini-elephants yet,
1607.1 they seem to have a teacup version
1609.14 of pretty much every dog breed.
1612.121 You can look that up,
1612.992 I certainly have mixed
feelings about this notion
1615.84 of trying to downsize everything
1617.59 to the point where you could
1618.49 kind of like the pocket-sized bulldog
1620.18 I think of someday will arrive.
1621.39 I'm not a fan of that kind of downsizing
1623.087 of different breeds,
1624.57 but because there aren't teacup elephants
1626.46 and teacup gorillas, and teacup
chimpanzees, and so forth,
1630.3 most all of those other
species are larger than us.
1633.14 They have these von Economo neurons
1635.93 and we have these von Economo neurons,
1638.06 but we have in upwards
of 80,000 of these things
1642.46 in our posterior insula.
1644.05 These other species tend to have
1645.6 somewhere in the range of
1,000 to maybe 10,000 or so.
1649.23 Why is that interesting?
1650.81 Well, these von Economo neurons
1654.01 have the unique property of integrating
1656.94 our knowledge about our body movements,
1660.81 our sense of pain and discomfort,
1663.29 and can drive motivational processes
1665.7 that allow us to lean into discomfort
1668.03 and, indeed, to overcome any discomfort
1670.5 if we decide that the discomfort
that we are experiencing
1673.14 is good for us or directed
toward a specific goal.
1677.06 This knowledge turns out
1678.07 to be very important to keep in mind
1679.76 because as we migrate this conversation
1681.92 toward the things that we can do
1683.36 to enhance flexibility and stretching,
1686.29 you'll soon learn that there are moments
1688.52 within a stretching protocol
1690.08 where you have the opportunity
to either override pain
1693.64 and discomfort to kind of relax through it
1696.33 or push through it.
1697.97 Right, there's a decision
fork in the road there,
1701.24 and it'll tell you which
fork in the road to take,
1703.89 or to say, "Uh-uh, I'm
not going to do that.
1706.74 I'm going to allow these natural reflexes
1708.75 of the spindle to kick in
1710.08 and just essentially
stop me from stretching
1712.52 if a given limb isn't designed
1714.67 or shouldn't be stretched that far."
1717.42 So, I'd like you to keep these
von Economo neurons in mind.
1722.69 I should mention they're named von Economo
1724.27 because the guy, Constantin von Economo,
1726.45 that discovered them at the
end of the 1800s, early 1900s,
1731.21 decided to name them after
himself, as many scientists do,
1734.13 or certainly the
neurologists and physicians
1736.87 are famous for naming
things after themselves.
1738.89 These von Economo neurons
1740.55 turn out to be very
important to keep in mind
1742.73 as we embark on our exploration
1744.78 of what sorts of stretching practices
1748.15 can be best applied to
increase flexibility
1751.55 because whether or not
you undertake a mild,
1755.7 moderate, or intense flexibility training,
1759.59 you will no doubt encounter
a scenario at some point
1763.54 where you will have to ask
yourself, "Do I quote-unquote
1767.39 relax into this stretch,
1769.38 or do I try and push through
1771.26 just a little bit of discomfort?"
1773.06 And I'll explain how
to gauge that decision
1775.45 in a very specific and ideally safe way,
1778.93 and I'll give you some
tools that will allow you
1780.3 to make that decision in a way
1781.75 that best preserves the integrity
of those neural circuits
1784.9 that I described earlier
and can keep you safe.
1787.59 These von Economo neurons
sit in the exact position
1791.81 that one would want to be able to evaluate
1794.23 what's going on in the body,
1795.87 in particular what's going on
in terms of limb movements,
1798.41 how that relates to our
feelings of discomfort.
1800.69 And then there's the other aspect
1803.61 of these von Economo neurons,
1805.01 which is that these von Economo neurons
1807.83 are connected to a number
of different brain areas
1810.83 that can shift our internal state
1812.78 from one of so-called
sympathetic activation.
1815.19 So, this is a pattern of
alertness and even stress,
1819.58 sometimes even panic,
1820.6 but typically alertness and stress
1823.08 to one of so called
parasympathetic activation
1826.71 to one of relaxation.
1830.29 Oftentimes, you'll hear that stretching
1832.3 should be done by
relaxing into the stretch.
1834.9 Well, what does it actually
mean to relax into the stretch?
1837.71 Well, these von Economo neurons
1839.77 sit at this junction where
they're able to evaluate
1842.34 what's going on inside our body
1844.49 and allow us to access neural circuitries
1847.02 by which we can shift our
relative level of alertness
1850.93 down a bit, or our relative
level of stress down a bit
1855.27 and thereby to increase so-called
parasympathetic activation
1859.6 and to literally override some
of those spindle mechanisms,
1864.42 even the GTO mechanisms,
1865.88 but especially the spindle mechanisms
1868.37 at the neuromuscular and
muscular spinal junction.
1872.9 And in that way,
1874.82 gently, subtly override the reflex
1878.43 that would otherwise cause us
1879.45 to contract those muscles back.
1881.0 The reason that's possible
is because your brain
1885.38 has those other kinds of motor neurons,
1887.04 the upper motor neurons
that can both direct,
1890.75 meaning control, and can
override lower motor neurons.
1895.94 I'll give you a brief example of this
1897.36 that you've already done in your life,
1899.03 and that we all have the capacity for.
1901.65 What I'm referring to is the
monosynaptic stretch reflex.
1905.64 This is something that every
first year neuroscience
1908.74 graduate student learns,
1910.04 which is that if you were to step
1911.9 on a sharp object with a bare foot,
1914.62 you would not need to make the decision
1916.78 to retract your foot, you
would automatically do that
1920.01 provided you have a
healthy nervous system.
1922.18 There are mechanisms in place
1923.89 that cause the retraction of that limb
1926.72 by way of ensuring that
the proper muscles contract
1930.61 and other muscles do not contract,
1933.06 in fact, that they fully relax.
1934.58 Okay, so in the case of
stepping on a sharp object
1937.51 like a piece of glass,
or a nail, or a tack,
1939.84 you would essentially
activate the hip flexor
1942.12 to lift up your foot
as quickly as possible.
1945.54 In doing so, that same neural circuit
1949.7 would activate a contralateral,
1952.26 meaning opposite side of the body circuit,
1955.0 to ensure that the leg,
1956.54 the foot that's not
stepping on the sharp object
1959.2 would do exactly the
opposite and would extend
1962.64 to make sure that you don't fall over.
1964.64 All of that happens reflexively,
1966.57 it does not require any
thought or decision making.
1970.28 In fact, humans without any neocortex,
1974.62 literally that who decerebrate
1977.78 or an animal that doesn't have...
1979.68 When I say decerebrate, I
mean lack of cerebral cortex.
1984.44 They can perform that
1985.44 because it's all controlled by circuits
1987.16 that are basically below the
brain and in the spinal cord.
1991.31 There's a little bit of
activation of circuits
1992.81 in the kind of deeper parts of the brain,
1994.48 but basically you don't need to think
1996.34 or decide in order to do that.
1998.23 However, if your life depended
2001.5 on walking across some
sharp objects, let's say.
2005.07 Let's make it a little less dramatic
2006.42 so it's not like the "Die
Hard" movie or something
2008.25 where he has to run
barefoot across the glass,
2010.89 although that's a pretty good example
2012.66 of what I'm describing here,
2014.11 but let's say you had to walk
across some very hot stones
2017.46 to get away from something
that you wanted to avoid.
2020.91 You could override that stretch reflex
2023.92 by way of a decision made
with your upper motor neurons,
2026.5 your insula, and your cognition,
2027.92 and almost certainly
those von Economo neurons,
2030.13 which would be screaming, "Don't do this,
2031.53 don't do this, don't do this,"
2032.46 could shuttle that
information to brain areas
2034.94 that would allow you
to override the reflex
2037.49 and essentially push through the pain.
2039.52 And maybe even, in fact,
2041.59 even not experience the pain
2043.98 to the same degree or even at all.
2046.48 So, these von Economo neurons
2048.37 sit at a very important
junction within the brain.
2052.16 They pay attention to what's
going on in your body,
2054.55 pain, pleasure, et cetera.
2057.62 And that includes what's
going on with your limbs
2059.51 and your limb range of motion.
2061.24 They also are paying attention
2063.59 and can control the amount of activation,
2067.15 kind of alertness or calmness
2068.61 that you are able to
create within your body
2072.49 in response to a given sensory experience.
2075.56 And as I mentioned before,
2077.37 they seem to be uniquely
enriched in humans,
2079.5 they seem to be related to
the aspects of our evolution
2083.93 that allow us to make decisions
2086.18 about what to do with our body
2087.87 in ways that other
animals just simply can't.
2090.61 Before we go any further,
2091.56 I want to give you a practical tool
2093.46 that you can, of course, use,
2095.33 but that will also give
you insight and experience
2098.88 into your muscle spindle
spinal cord circuit mechanisms.
2103.42 So, what I'd like you to do
2105.55 is if you're in a proper place to do this,
2107.89 you're going to stand with legs straight,
2110.3 meaning knees not bent,
2111.78 and you're going to try
and touch your toes,
2113.91 or for some of you that's
going to be very easy
2116.3 and you might even be
able to put your hands
2118.15 flat on the floor.
2120.09 I don't have that kind of flexibility,
2120.923 it's pretty easy for me to touch my toes.
2123.18 I don't care if you
round your back or not,
2124.93 although ideally I would
say don't round your back.
2127.79 Not because it's bad to do so necessarily,
2129.79 but just to try and keep this
2132.36 the same from trial to trial, as it were.
2134.89 So, try and get a sense of
what your range of motion
2137.81 is in terms of bending over at the waist
2140.61 while maintaining a flat back
2141.9 and trying to touch your
toes or even touch the floor.
2143.99 Maybe, again, you can even
go hands flat to the floor
2146.5 or maybe even far out in front of you.
2148.82 Okay, now what I'd like
you to do is stand back up
2152.28 and I'd like you to
contract your quadriceps
2156.82 as hard as you possibly
can for about 5-15 seconds.
2161.29 Let's say 10 seconds
2162.34 just to keep things
more or less normalized.
2164.91 This obviously is not a
super controlled experiment.
2168.17 So, to contract your quadriceps
2169.55 for those of you who don't know,
2170.46 you're going to extend
your lower limb out.
2173.36 So, this would be like kicking,
2174.66 although don't do it too quickly,
2175.78 you're going to kick out your foot,
2178.97 you should feel your quadriceps contract
2180.81 on the top of your thighs.
2182.06 And you're going to try and
consciously contract them
2184.77 as hard as you can.
2186.3 Okay, typically if you
want to point your toe
2188.99 back towards your knee or
shin that's also going to help
2191.56 somewhat to contract
even harder and harder.
2194.56 Okay, so, do that for about 10 seconds.
2197.89 A lot of you will do
this just while standing,
2200.07 contract, contract, contract.
2201.11 Okay, then release it,
2202.66 and then now go ahead
and repeat that stretch
2207.18 where you're trying to touch
your toes or touch the floor.
2209.49 So, this is, again, relying more or less
2211.52 on hamstring flexibility
among other things.
2214.68 Okay, what most of you will find
2216.84 is that you have an immediate increase
2219.59 in hamstring flexibility,
2221.1 or your range of motion has increased.
2224.33 If you didn't experience that,
2225.61 then I would encourage you
2226.45 to try and contract your
quadriceps harder and longer,
2229.41 so maybe 20 or 30 seconds,
2231.06 and then try this
so-called experiment again.
2235.15 Why would contracting your quadriceps
2237.32 allow your hamstring flexibility
to suddenly increase?
2241.88 Well, the way that our
muscles are organized
2245.17 is such that we have muscles
2247.59 that are antagonistic to one another.
2250.03 So, our quadriceps and our hamstrings
2253.07 work in sort of a push-pull
fashion, if you will.
2256.73 They can antagonize one another,
2258.54 so when you move your
heel towards your glutes,
2262.19 you are using your hamstring,
2263.76 the hamstring obviously
also does other things
2265.58 related to hip movement.
2266.89 And when you lift your knee
2269.86 or when you extend your foot
2273.12 and contract your quadriceps,
2275.0 you are essentially
relaxing the hamstrings.
2278.34 Now, of course, most movements
2279.5 involve both quadricep and
hamstring in synchrony.
2282.77 And that synchrony is
really an elegant one,
2284.95 but here we're more or less isolating
2286.47 the quadriceps from the hamstrings,
2287.76 at least to the extent
that it can leverage
2289.93 these spindle stretch mechanisms.
2292.16 So, what happens is when you
contract your quadriceps hard,
2295.54 you are relaxing or
releasing some of the stretch
2300.89 that's occurring in those
intrafusal spindle sensory fibers
2304.47 going into your spinal cord.
2305.86 And as a consequence,
2308.51 you're able then to stretch
your hamstrings further,
2313.47 or we can be more accurate and
say that your range of motion
2317.35 about the hamstring and its related joints
2319.75 is greater when you aren't
engaging that spindle reflex,
2324.01 which would cause the
hamstrings to contract.
2326.44 Okay, so if you are somebody
who has tight hamstrings,
2328.8 there could be a variety
of reasons for that,
2331.02 but part of the reason
is likely to be neural
2334.6 and you can release that
neural spindle reflex
2337.63 by contracting the opposite
antagonistic muscle,
2341.49 which in this case is the quadriceps.
2343.3 The same thing is true
and can be leveraged
2345.69 for stretching other muscles.
2347.04 So, for instance, if you're
going to do a tricep stretch,
2348.82 the typical kind of overhead
where you grab your elbow
2351.02 and move it toward the
midline of your body
2353.67 with using your opposite hand.
2356.4 Well, you can do that,
2357.71 and then I would suggest
trying to flex your bicep,
2361.11 contract your bicep that
is, while doing that.
2363.73 And for most people
you'll notice a increase
2366.61 in the tricep range of motion
2368.39 or ability to kind of lean into,
2370.99 or to relax into, or to push that stretch,
2375.02 excuse me, a little bit further.
2376.82 Now, for you physios out there
2378.95 and for those of you that have
backgrounds in kinesiology,
2382.03 I want to acknowledge,
2382.863 of course, there are other mechanisms
2384.21 that are coming into play.
2385.76 There are actually neural connections
2387.86 within the joints themselves
2389.32 that are providing
proprioceptive feedback,
2391.16 et cetera, et cetera.
2392.16 But this is simply to illustrate
2394.38 that part of our range of motion
2397.25 is determined by these spindle mechanisms
2399.94 that I spent some time
focusing on earlier.
2403.08 And indeed, this approach can be leveraged
2405.83 toward creating increased
limb range of motion,
2409.37 not just for the hamstrings,
but for your quadriceps.
2412.01 So, for instance, if you
have tight quadriceps,
2414.65 you can do the opposite.
2415.72 You can contract your
hamstring very intensely
2419.61 for let's say 10 seconds, or
20 seconds, or 30 seconds.
2423.08 So, that would take some conscious effort
2424.6 of bringing your heel
up towards your glutes.
2428.56 You could do that in a way
2429.58 that you're really trying to
contract those muscles hard,
2431.64 you'd have to use some deliberate
2432.9 hamstring activation there,
2434.19 meaning you have to use
those upper motor neurons
2436.097 and the other aspects of your
upper brain power, as it were,
2439.99 to try and really contract your hamstrings
2442.84 as intensely as possible,
then you would relax that,
2446.67 and then you would do your
quadricep stretch again.
2449.04 And if you did a pre-hamstring contraction
2451.73 measurement of your quadricep flexibility,
2454.68 and then you did a
post-hamstring contraction
2458.04 measure of your quadricep flexibility,
2460.92 almost certainly you would find
2461.91 that that flexibility had increased.
2463.93 Now, of course, the muscle
really didn't change much,
2466.91 the tendons didn't change much.
2468.59 What changed was the
patterns of neural activation
2470.93 that were restricting you
from in the first case
2473.94 stretching your hamstring or having a...
2476.8 To be more accurate we should say
2478.3 having a certain range of
motion about the hamstring
2482.26 and its related joints
2484.63 and those brake mechanisms were removed.
2486.82 And, of course, then when
you contract your hamstring,
2488.57 you're removing some of the neural brakes,
2490.45 the spindle acting as a brake
2493.44 and inhibiting that
quadricep range of motion.
2497.22 Okay, so you can imagine this,
2498.697 and in fact you can apply this
2500.07 for any number of different muscles,
2501.8 the larger muscles and the sort of biceps,
2504.03 triceps, and hamstrings, quadriceps
2507.3 that are sort of the simplest
place to think about this
2509.167 and to apply it.
2510.38 But in theory and, indeed, in practice,
2513.02 it really works for all
the various muscle groups,
2515.493 it's just sometimes harder to access
2517.35 these so-called
antagonistic muscle groups.
2520.2 Now, we should take a
moment and just discuss
2524.12 what actually happens
as we get more flexible
2526.49 in the short-term and long-term.
2527.58 I just mentioned what
happens in the short-term,
2529.66 clearly those don't involve
lengthening of the muscles.
2533.95 It's not like the muscles
slide along the bones
2536.06 or that the tendons really stretch out
2538.15 that much more than they had
prior to that kind of exercise.
2542.92 But it is the case that if people stretch
2546.45 consistently over a given
period of several weeks or more
2550.78 that there are changes in the muscles.
2553.37 This gets a little bit tricky
in terms of nomenclature,
2555.66 and I just want to highlight that
2556.99 because I think that a number of people
2559.47 get frustrated and confused,
2562.44 in fact, when we talk about
muscles getting longer.
2566.39 You know, that the whole concept
of a muscle getting longer
2568.86 isn't really in keeping with reality,
2570.81 but there are elements within the muscles
2573.26 that can change their confirmation.
2575.52 So, to get a little bit detailed here,
2577.34 and we won't spend too much time on this,
2578.65 but I just want to acknowledge this
2579.79 for those of you that are interested
2580.75 in neuromuscular physiology
2582.09 and how it relates to flexibility.
2584.0 You know, you have your muscle fibers
2585.9 and then you have your
so-called myofibrils.
2588.57 So, you can imagine
kind of a single fiber,
2592.1 that fiber, of course, will get input
2593.62 from those motor neurons.
2594.96 And then within those fibers,
2597.39 you have what are called sarcomeres.
2598.88 And you can kind of think about sarcomeres
2600.37 as little segments, kind of
like the segments of bamboo.
2602.61 If you ever look at bamboo,
it's not just one big stalk,
2605.37 it's got those little
outpouching along the way
2608.55 that going to break up
2611.43 the what would be just
one big stalk of bamboo
2614.58 into different segments,
but they're all connected.
2617.11 The sarcomeres are somewhat like that.
2620.57 And within the sarcomeres
2622.01 you have a couple of different components.
2623.47 One thing is called myosin,
which is like a thick layer,
2626.83 and then the other is actin.
2628.2 And those are interdigitated, as we say,
2630.97 they're kind of connected to one another,
2632.42 kind of like if you were
put your fingers together
2634.21 from your two hands.
2635.79 If you put your fingers
2637.12 in between one another,
that's interdigitated,
2639.14 literally interdigitated in
this case, so pun intended.
2643.01 And that myosin and actin
2646.78 kind of move relative to one another
2648.61 and they have a lot to
do with your ability
2650.21 to contract muscles.
2651.64 When we stretch muscles,
2654.59 when we go through a stretching practice,
2656.46 there are a number of things that change,
2657.94 some neural, some related
directly to connective tissue,
2661.58 but also it appears from really nice work
2663.71 mainly done from McGill University,
2666.12 I'll provide a link to a
couple of these studies
2667.59 if you want to dig in there more deeply,
2670.19 that change the confirmation,
2672.74 the relative size and spacing
of some of these things
2675.76 like sarcomeres and the
way that myosin and actin
2678.73 kind of work together.
2680.43 But we don't want to think
of muscles as lengthening,
2684.4 we can, however, think about
the resting state of a muscle
2688.49 being slightly different
or, indeed, very different
2691.58 than the resting state of a muscle
2694.03 of somebody or of a limb
2695.67 that has not undergone
regular flexibility training.
2698.65 So, that's as much time
as I want to spend on that
2700.52 because we could spend an entire hour
2701.9 getting right down into the details,
2703.85 but I do want to emphasize, however,
2705.54 that muscles have different
parts, they have fibers,
2707.89 they have sarcomeres, they
have myosin, they have actin.
2711.56 But the idea of making our muscles longer,
2713.9 that reflects a number of processes
2715.87 that occur basically within
an existing muscle length.
2719.91 The length of our muscle bellies
2721.76 and where our insertions are relative
2724.95 to our connective tissue in our limbs
2726.66 is genetically determined, right?
2729.54 Some people have, for instance,
2730.84 a bicep that goes all the way
from the crook of their elbow
2734.07 up to their shoulder, right?
2736.37 And some people can if
they were to put their arm
2739.04 in a 90 degree angle could
put two or three fingers
2741.91 between their bicep and their elbow.
2744.36 They have, we can say, a shorter
bicep, relatively shorter.
2748.37 Now, the reason I mentioned
2749.6 these highly detailed cellular mechanisms
2752.13 is because as we start to
embark on different protocols
2756.33 for using stretching
to increase flexibility
2759.257 and range of motion,
2760.97 we need to ask ourselves what
is preventing our ability
2764.96 to extend range of motion?
2766.7 Is it the spindle, right?
2768.1 Is it because the muscle
is stretching too much?
2770.93 Oftentimes, it can be because of that
2772.577 and/or because of a sense of pain
2774.59 or simply a sense that the
muscle is not in a position
2778.87 that it's been in before
2780.26 that's unrelated to pain
or to spindle activation.
2783.39 And oftentimes, it can be related directly
2787.31 to these changes in the
confirmation of myosin and actin,
2791.34 and within the context of the sarcomeres.
2794.12 Now, of course, you can't peer into
2795.84 or sense your individual sarcomeres,
2798.0 however, you do have neurons
that innovate these areas
2801.68 and that send that sensory information
2803.44 back into the spinal cord and
up to your brain to interpret.
2806.01 So, you'll find that as we move along,
2808.27 there are specific
adjustments that you can make
2810.95 at both the macro level,
2812.77 meaning how much movement to insert
2815.83 into your stretching, right?
2816.88 Is it going to be a static,
2817.72 or a dynamic, or even a ballistic stretch?
2820.07 Or, for instance, at the micro level,
2823.26 that even just a slight sub-millimeter
2826.04 or millimeter increase in the
stretching of a given muscle
2830.97 and it related tissues
2832.75 can translate into an increased
range of motion performance.
2836.19 As a quick but relevant aside,
2837.54 I thought I'd share with
you something useful
2839.66 that's also grounded in this
notion of antagonistic muscles.
2844.28 So, for those of you that
do resistance training,
2846.91 whether or not it's with body weight,
2848.23 or with physical weights,
or machines, what have you,
2851.67 you may have found that if you,
2852.98 let's say, were to do three
sets of a pushing exercise,
2855.77 so this could be pushups,
2857.8 this could be bench presses,
this could be shoulder presses,
2860.22 something of that sort.
2861.81 And then, later in the
workout you were to do,
2865.1 let's say, machine
pull-downs, or pull-ups,
2868.11 or chin-ups of some sort,
so a pulling exercise.
2871.24 Typically, what you would find
2872.35 is if you were to do what's
often called straight sets,
2875.42 so you would do three sets of pushups,
2877.52 let's say, with two
minutes of rest in between
2880.58 that you might be able to get
2881.7 a certain number of
repetitions on the first set.
2883.98 Let's just for sake of example,
2885.8 let's say you can get 10
repetitions on the first set,
2889.1 and then you get eight
repetitions on the second set,
2892.68 and then you get six
repetitions on the third set
2894.65 with two minutes in between,
2896.44 and then you would move on at some point
2898.95 to your pulling exercises.
2900.63 And similarly, let's say
you were doing chin-ups
2902.91 or pull-downs and you
would get 10 repetitions,
2905.25 rest two minutes,
2906.083 eight repetitions, rest two
minutes, and six repetitions.
2908.79 Okay, fine.
2910.06 Well, typically what people discover
2913.19 is that if they interleave
2914.91 their pushing and pulling exercises,
2917.09 provided they do that for muscles
2918.79 that are antagonistic to one another.
2920.88 So, in this case, pushing with the chest,
2923.86 shoulders, and triceps
for the pushing exercises,
2926.29 and pulling with the back and biceps,
2928.48 and, of course, there are
other muscles involved as well.
2930.61 But because those muscle groups
2931.98 are at least in part
antagonistic to one another,
2934.81 what people often find
is that if they were
2937.09 to, say, do their pushing
set, get 10 repetitions,
2940.73 then move to a pulling set
2944.93 after just say 60 seconds
and perform that pulling set,
2949.32 then go back to the pushing set,
2953.05 then go back to a pulling set,
2954.63 push, pull, push, pull,
2956.18 in other words, interleaving their sets.
2958.07 Even if they were to maintain
the same amount of rest
2961.52 between sets of pushing
and sets of pulling,
2965.33 what they discover often is that the drop
2968.78 in the number of repetitions that they get
2971.29 is somewhat offset.
2972.41 So, rather than get 10, 8, 6,
2974.87 as it were with the straight sets,
2976.5 it will be 10, 9, 8.
2979.89 So, what this means is
not that you're increasing
2983.79 the total rest time to
four minutes between sets
2985.97 because then, of course,
it wouldn't be equivalent,
2988.84 but rather that while maintaining
the same amount of rest
2992.04 between sets for this same muscle group,
2995.47 by going from push, pull, push, pull
2998.15 of antagonistic muscles,
3000.37 you're able to have improved performance.
3003.96 And the reason for that
has everything to do
3006.13 with what we were describing before,
3008.09 which is that typically if
you were to do push set,
3012.03 rest, push set, rest, push set, rest.
3015.0 Well, in between those sets
3017.46 and, in fact, actually
during those sets of pushing,
3020.54 the pulling muscles that would
be involved in the chin-ups
3024.48 or pull-downs, et cetera,
are actually relaxing,
3027.75 or at least are being
released of some tension,
3029.97 including the activation of the
spindles among other things.
3034.24 So, that's a long-winded way of saying
3036.25 that interleaving push and
pull of antagonistic sets
3040.3 can leverage some of
the same neural circuits
3042.61 that we're talking about leveraging
3043.76 for sake of increasing flexibility.
3045.67 Now, I offer this to you
as a tool that you can try.
3049.19 One of the challenges
with using this tool,
3051.02 however, is that you often
have to occupy multiple sites
3054.31 within the gym.
3055.3 You know, if you're doing this at home
3057.06 and you have your own
gym, that's one thing.
3058.96 If you're doing this in a gym
3059.86 where you have multiple
pieces of equipment,
3061.62 well, then you become that person
3062.94 who has essentially taken
over some small corner,
3065.39 or multiple corners, or
machines within the gym.
3068.37 And oftentimes, you'll
find that you'll walk back
3070.12 to a machine or you'll walk back
3071.51 to a given resistance exercise
3073.59 and someone has now taken it over
3074.827 and the whole thing could be thrown off.
3076.21 So, it takes a little bit of orchestrating
3078.75 in order to do properly.
3080.27 But in general, what people find
3082.08 is that this can allow you to
enhance performance overall
3085.11 of these individual movements,
3086.76 again, while maintaining
the same amount of rest.
3090.96 And even if you choose not to do this,
3092.97 I encourage you to pay
attention to this as a concept
3096.93 because, again, it's leveraging this idea
3099.31 of antagonistic muscles,
flexors and extensors,
3102.34 antagonistic neural relationships
3104.67 between the spinal cord mechanisms
3106.68 that control one set of muscles
3108.89 and activating those muscles,
3110.18 allowing the opposite
antagonistic muscle to relax
3113.99 and therefore to perform
better on its next set.
3117.61 So, now I'd like to shift to the question
3119.16 of what types of stretching
can and should we do
3121.89 to increase limb range of motion?
3124.38 If our goal is to do that
3125.52 in the most efficient way possible
3127.12 'cause I realize that most people
3128.17 don't have endless amounts of time
3130.4 to dedicate to a stretching practice.
3133.31 And even for those of us that do,
3134.94 I'm sure that you want
to get the most outcome
3138.08 for a given effort.
3139.75 And what are the modes of stretching
3141.64 that are going to allow us
to increase our flexibility
3144.107 and limb range of motion most safely?
3147.12 Now, there are a number of
different types of stretching
3149.1 or methods of stretching.
3151.05 Broadly defined, we can
describe these as dynamic,
3156.0 ballistic, static, and
what's called PNF stretching.
3160.68 PNF stands for Proprioceptive
Neuromuscular Facilitation,
3165.15 and it involves and leverages
many of the mechanisms
3168.5 that I described to you earlier.
3170.12 The first two that I mentioned,
3171.14 dynamic and ballistic stretching,
3172.75 both involves some degree of momentum,
3175.95 and can be distinguished
3176.98 from static and PNF-type stretching.
3179.74 Now, to distinguish dynamic stretching
3182.07 from ballistic stretching,
3183.427 I'd like to focus on
this element of momentum.
3186.45 Both involve moving a limb
through a given range of motion,
3192.49 in dynamic stretching, however,
3194.73 it tends to be more controlled,
less use of momentum,
3197.43 especially towards the
end range of motion.
3200.0 Whereas in ballistic stretching,
3202.12 there tends to be a bit
more swinging of the limb
3205.58 or use of momentum.
3207.31 So, I invite you to visualize what dynamic
3209.44 and ballistic stretching
might look like in your mind,
3211.58 you can even try it if it's
safe for you to try it.
3213.88 You know, you could imagine
swinging your arm up overhead
3216.83 as much as possible and bringing it down.
3218.34 I'm doing this because I'm seated,
3219.53 it's kind of a ridiculous
movement to do while seated
3221.48 or perhaps at all.
3222.88 But for instance,
3224.16 you can see dynamic and
ballistic stretching.
3226.64 Anytime someone, for instance,
is holding onto something
3229.24 with one arm or maybe not holding on
3230.99 and swinging out their foot,
3233.69 so essentially getting
movement about the hip joint.
3237.71 And you'll notice that
some people raise it up,
3239.68 and pause it, and bring it down,
3241.27 that's one form of dynamic stretching.
3243.84 Whereas others will swing it up
3247.22 and sort of let it carry
itself a bit further
3250.31 due to the momentum at
the top of the movement,
3252.02 and then just let it drop back down
3253.4 or maybe even control the descent.
3254.98 There is an enormous range
of parameter space here
3258.67 or variables that one could imagine,
3260.66 and there's just simply no way
3262.15 that we could subdivide all those.
3263.34 But again, dynamic and
ballistic stretching
3265.5 both involve movement,
3267.68 so we have to generate some force
3269.27 in order to create that movement.
3271.5 Ballistic stretching
involving a bit more momentum
3273.657 or sometimes a lot more momentum,
3275.46 especially at the end range of of motion.
3278.09 Now, both of those are highly distinct
3280.15 from static stretching,
3281.42 which involves holding
the end range of motion,
3284.25 so minimizing the amount
of momentum that's used.
3287.04 So, to stay with the simple example
3288.87 that we are all now familiar with
3290.9 from our earlier discussion,
3293.43 slowly bending over at the waist
3295.44 and trying to touch your toes
3297.46 or putting your hands to the floor
3299.35 and then holding that end position
3301.84 before coming up in a
slow and controlled way,
3305.29 such that you reduce the
amount of momentum to near zero
3310.81 would be one example of static stretching.
3313.29 Static stretching can
be further subdivided
3315.59 into active or passive.
3317.67 Right, there are different names
3319.52 for these kinds of approaches.
3321.38 You can hear about the Anderson approach
3323.03 or the Jander approach,
3324.08 you can look these sorts
of things up online.
3326.08 And, again, people tend to
name things after themselves,
3328.15 so some of these are proprietary
3329.8 related to specific programs,
I'm not focusing on those.
3332.42 Others come to be named
after the physiologists
3334.65 or the practitioners that
initially popularize them.
3338.2 As is always the case,
3339.56 there's always a naming and renaming
3341.1 and claiming of territory
with these things.
3343.57 For the time being, I'd
like to just emphasize
3345.51 that static stretching can be both active,
3348.37 where there's a dedicated effort
3351.79 on the part of the stretcher, you,
3354.86 to put force behind the
hold to kind of extend
3359.41 or literally to extend
the range of motion.
3362.03 And then, there's also
passive static stretching
3365.81 in which it's more of a relaxation
3367.85 into a further range of motion,
3369.95 and that can be a subtle distinction.
3371.42 And there are other ways in
which we can further distinguish
3373.73 active and passive static stretching.
3375.95 But nonetheless, static stretching
3377.21 involves both those types of
elements, active and passive,
3381.41 but is really about eliminating momentum.
3384.28 And then, there's the PNF,
3386.637 the Proprioceptive
Neuromuscular Facilitation.
3388.7 And proprioception has
several different meanings
3391.8 in the context of
neuroscience and physiology.
3394.44 To just keep it really simple for today,
3396.82 proprioception involves both
a knowledge and understanding
3400.15 of where our limbs are in
space and relative to our body.
3404.51 Typically, relative to the midline,
3405.93 so the brain is often trying to figure out
3408.06 where are our limbs
relative to our midline
3410.75 down the center of our body.
3412.52 And we know where our limbs are
3414.91 based on so-called
proprioceptive feedback,
3417.13 so that's feedback that
comes from sensory neurons.
3420.64 Right, now you know what sensory neurons
3422.55 that are essentially monitoring
3425.48 or responding to events within the joints,
3428.63 the connective tissue, and the muscles,
3431.32 and within the deep
components of the muscles
3434.97 like the spindle reflex,
3436.13 and within the tendons like the GTO,
3438.49 the Golgi tendon organ.
3440.1 So, PNF-type stretching
3443.34 leverages these sorts of
mechanisms, these neural circuits,
3448.24 by way of, for instance,
you would lie on your back
3452.15 and if your goal is to increase
your hamstring flexibility
3455.35 and the flexibility and range of motion
3457.62 of other related muscle systems,
3460.21 you might put a strap around your ankle
3462.35 and pull that muscle.
3465.14 Or I should say, excuse
me, that limb towards you,
3467.49 you're not going to pull
the muscle towards you,
3468.55 you're going to pull that
limb your ankle towards you
3469.933 to try and get it sort
of back over your head.
3472.61 And then, progressively
relaxing into that,
3475.53 or maybe even putting
some additional force
3478.46 to push the end range of
motion and then relaxing it.
3481.86 And then, actually trying
to stretch that same limb
3484.81 or increase the limb range
of motion without the strap.
3488.21 Right, sometimes these are
assisted by other people.
3491.53 So, people will even use loads,
3493.72 sometimes they'll even use machines.
3495.7 There are a number of different apparati
3497.72 that have been designed for this,
3498.95 sometimes it'll involve
a training partner.
3501.82 There's a huge range of PNF protocols,
3505.17 and those protocols can
be done both by oneself
3508.95 with or without straps, with machines,
3510.9 with actual weights, or
with training partners.
3514.5 If you're interested in
the variation of exercises
3516.96 to, say, target your hamstrings
versus your quadriceps
3519.99 versus your shoulders versus
your chest muscles, et cetera,
3522.66 your neck muscles, and so on,
3524.72 there is an enormous range of information
3527.68 on dynamic, ballistic,
static, and PNF stretches
3530.62 for all the various muscle groups.
3532.63 And I should say there
are some excellent books
3535.34 on those topics,
3536.21 there are also some excellent videos
3538.08 on YouTube and elsewhere.
3539.9 Nowadays, it's pretty
easy to find exercises
3543.33 that allow you to target
specific muscle groups.
3546.87 Again, I encourage you to be
safe in how you approach this,
3549.36 and I would encourage
you also to pay attention
3551.87 to the information that soon follows
3553.56 as to what sorts of
protocols one would use
3555.97 to apply those exercises.
3557.81 But the number of exercises
3560.04 and the availability of those exercises
3562.04 for targeting different muscle groups
3563.28 with these four different
kinds of stretching
3565.36 is both immense and
fortunately, thankfully,
3569.91 immediately accessible to
all of us often at zero cost.
3572.83 So, specific exercises
3574.68 to target specific muscle groups aside,
3576.56 we've now established
3577.49 that there are four major
categories of stretching,
3580.24 or at least those are
the four major categories
3582.44 I'm defining today.
3584.53 And we can further divide those categories
3587.94 into which are the ones that
are going to be most effective
3591.06 for increasing range of
motion in the long-term,
3593.74 not just in one individual session.
3596.2 And there have been a number
of studies exploring this.
3599.38 I can list out at least four,
3600.84 and we'll put those four
as a kind of a cluster
3603.43 under one heading in
the show note captions
3606.09 that arrive at essentially
the same answer,
3609.18 which is that for increasing
limb range of motion,
3612.86 it does appear that static type,
3616.19 including PNF, but static-type stretching
3620.34 is going to be more effective
3622.03 than dynamic and ballistic stretching.
3625.8 So, at least in my
mind, this is good news.
3628.69 Why is it good news to me?
3629.85 Well, while dynamic and
ballistic stretching
3632.72 can be immensely useful
for improving performance
3636.45 of specific movements,
3638.59 in particular, in the
context of particular sports
3641.06 like tennis, or in sprinting,
or frankly for any sport,
3645.52 they do carry with them
a certain amount of risk
3648.54 because of the use of momentum.
3650.49 So, you don't need to be highly trained
3652.61 in order to perform them.
3653.71 In fact, there is a place
3655.21 and we will describe when one
would want to apply dynamic
3658.22 or ballistic stretching.
3659.92 I'll just give away for now,
3661.83 I think that most physios out there
3663.68 and certainly the ones that I spoke to,
3664.91 Dr. Andy Galpin, Dr. Kelly
Starrett, and a few others
3670.56 point to the fact that doing some safe
3674.89 dynamic and ballistic stretching
3676.44 prior to, say, a resistance
training session,
3679.93 or maybe even prior to a
cardiovascular training session
3683.33 can be useful both in terms
of range of motion effects
3687.54 and in terms of neural activation effects.
3690.57 I don't want to use the words warm-up
3691.94 because warming up is typically associated
3693.83 with increasing core body
temperature, as it should be,
3697.01 but for engaging the neural circuits
3700.51 and becoming familiarized
with the neural circuits
3703.22 that you're about to
use in other movements
3705.16 while also increasing the
range of motion of the joints
3707.96 involved in those movements
3708.89 so that you can perform them more safely
3710.47 and more confidently.
3711.81 So, I'm certainly not saying,
3714.06 I want to repeat, I'm certainly not saying
3715.37 that dynamic and ballistic
stretching are not useful,
3717.51 they absolutely are,
3719.1 but in terms of increasing
limb range of motion
3721.6 in the long-term of truly
becoming more flexible
3726.18 as opposed to transiently more flexible,
3730.01 static stretching, which includes PNF,
3734.14 appears to be the best route to go.
3735.82 So, if your goal is to increase
your limb range of motion
3738.44 for a given muscle group, or
perhaps for all muscle groups,
3741.85 although you can imagine
that'd be pretty tough.
3743.65 I mean, you're not going to spend time,
3745.33 I could imagine, working on
your tongue muscle control
3748.35 or neck muscle control
and every muscle control,
3751.03 but most of us want to
reduce so-called tightness
3754.14 in air quotes and increase
limb range of motion
3756.75 for certain muscle groups.
3758.53 And it appears that
the best way to do that
3761.76 is going to be static
stretching of some kind,
3764.46 which raises the question of how often
3766.6 to do that static stretching
3767.79 and how long to hold
those static stretches.
3771.07 And we can also ask the question,
3772.87 we should ask the question,
3774.65 where to hold those static stretches?
3776.62 Is it always a good idea to
hold those static stretches
3779.75 at the end or the point of
maximal range of motion?
3784.18 We're going to address that now.
3785.58 There's some terrific science around this.
3787.71 A slightly older study,
3788.87 but nonetheless a powerful one
3790.98 because it provided a foundation
3792.81 for a lot of subsequent work,
3794.1 which basically served to just confirm
3795.99 the answer they got here is
a study from Bandy et al.
3799.99 And the title of this study
3801.58 is The Effect of Time and
Frequency of Static Stretching
3804.5 on the Flexibility of
the Hamstring Muscles.
3807.788 It was a study involving 93 subjects,
3810.04 so 61 men, 32 women ranging
an age from 21-39 years,
3814.86 so a pretty broad demographic
3817.25 who had limited hamstring
muscle flexibility,
3819.7 here I'm paraphrasing,
3820.7 and randomly assigned
to one of five groups.
3823.19 So, the four stretching groups
3825.34 stretched five days
per week for six weeks,
3828.35 the fifth group, which served
as a control, did not stretch.
3831.55 The results clearly show that quote,
3834.517 "The change in flexibility
appeared to be dependent
3836.79 on the duration and
frequency of stretching."
3838.75 This is great,
3839.583 this tells us that stretching
for a given amount of time
3842.65 scales with the amount
of limb range of motion
3845.0 improvement that one will see.
3846.86 There were many interesting
findings within this study,
3849.56 but the one that I'd like
to highlight most is quote,
3853.127 "The results of this study
suggest that a 30 second duration
3857.24 is an effective amount of time
3858.75 to sustain a hamstring muscle stretch
3860.6 in order to increase range of motion.
3863.35 No increase in flexibility occurred
3865.5 when the duration of
stretching was increased
3867.34 from 30 seconds to 60 seconds,
3870.27 or when the frequency of
stretching was increased
3872.6 from one to three times per day."
3875.09 Okay, so now we're starting
to lay down some parameters.
3878.31 What this study reveals and
what subsequent studies tell us,
3881.51 and we will get into
those subsequent studies,
3884.13 is that ideally one
would do static stretches
3888.38 that are held for 30 seconds.
3891.79 Perhaps more in certain instances,
3893.44 and I'll explain when that can be useful,
3895.22 but here holding those stretches
for more than 30 seconds
3899.45 did not turn out to be
additionally useful.
3902.63 So, if you're going to stretch
your quadricep, for instance,
3904.9 and you're going to hold that
stretch in static fashion,
3907.59 remember not using momentum,
3909.9 and you can use the mental tricks
3912.61 of either trying to push through the pain,
3914.89 which I don't recommend necessarily,
3917.02 I think that makes us prone to injury,
3919.59 or to relax into the stretch,
3921.25 but nonetheless providing some force
3923.51 typically with a hand in
order to pull your ankle back,
3926.65 if you're doing a quadricep stretch,
3927.88 some people might do this
on the edge of a sofa.
3929.8 Remember, there are a lot
of different exercises
3931.66 and ways to do this that
you can explore elsewhere.
3934.3 Well, holding that static
stretch for 30 seconds
3937.75 appears to be sufficient
3939.97 to stimulate an increase in
limb range of motion over time.
3944.09 Again, these are protocols
3944.99 that were used repeatedly over time,
3946.4 and we'll talk about
how often to repeat them
3948.68 in order to get maximal effect.
3950.3 But 30-second holds for static stretches
3952.95 is the number that I
think we want to focus on
3954.86 and that most of us are
going to want to utilize.
3956.99 So, now let's explore how
many sets of static stretching
3960.9 one ought to do in order to get
3963.42 a maximum range of motion improvement
3966.18 while not placing us into a system
3968.8 that's going to create injury
3970.29 nor a situation where we have
to be constantly stretching
3973.91 throughout the day
3974.743 because, again, most of us
don't have time to do that.
3977.15 This issue of sets is an important one.
3979.55 In the context of cardiovascular exercise,
3981.54 we've talked about the
data that support the fact
3984.52 that doing at least 150
3987.73 and ideally as much as
200 minutes per week
3990.33 of Zone 2 cardiovascular exercise
3992.37 is very useful for cardiovascular health
3994.15 and for other aspects of health.
3995.92 And, of course, there are other aspects
3996.99 of cardiovascular exercise
3998.23 that could be layered onto and into that
3999.683 that can be useful like 90 second
4001.83 maximal sprints, et cetera.
4003.38 Discussed this a lot in the
episode with Dr. Andy Galpin
4006.15 and on our episode about endurance.
4008.21 And we also talked about sets
4010.13 in the context of strength
and hypertrophy building,
4012.83 building muscle size and/or strength
4015.42 in the episode about that.
4017.35 And in particular, in the
episode with Dr. Andy Galpin,
4020.2 and there, we could also arrive
at some specific parameters.
4023.04 And it's going to vary, of
course, between individuals,
4025.76 depending on how hard you train,
4027.15 whether or not you take sets to failure,
4028.78 your repetition range, et cetera,
4030.63 but in the context of strength
and hypertrophy building,
4033.02 we arrived at a approximately six,
4036.78 maybe as many as 10 sets
per week per muscle group.
4039.9 Some of that work is done as direct work
4041.64 to a given muscle group, some
of that work is indirect.
4044.35 So, doing certain pulling exercise,
4045.95 of course, will target the
latissimus dorsi muscles,
4051.01 but also the biceps.
4052.01 So, that doesn't necessarily
mean you have to do 10 sets
4054.98 for the biceps and for the lats,
4056.5 sometimes you're getting some
indirect work, et cetera.
4058.36 All of that was delineated in the episode
4060.34 with Dr. Andy Galpin.
4061.8 And we arrived at those numbers of sets
4064.34 according to the same criteria
that we will apply here,
4067.37 what is the minimum number of sets
4070.32 both to maintain and to improve
4074.1 a given mode of performance?
4076.66 Strength and hypertrophy
or cardiovascular health,
4079.39 again, to either maintain or improve.
4081.32 And we can do the same thing for improving
4084.39 or maintaining range of motion
4086.25 because as I mentioned earlier,
4087.77 the data pointed to the fact
4088.96 that if we don't do some dedicated work
4091.43 to improve range of motion over time,
4093.77 we will lose our flexibility
4095.97 and limb range of motion over time
4098.18 just by virtue of the fact
4099.69 that we're not doing
anything to offset that.
4101.74 So, whether or not you want to maintain,
4104.36 reestablish, or gain limb range of motion,
4109.09 static stretching of holds of
30 seconds appear to be best.
4114.0 Now, the question is how
long should you do that?
4116.91 And how many sets should you do that?
4118.11 And how many times a
week should you do that?
4120.21 And to answer those questions,
4122.35 I'm going to turn to what I think
4123.76 is a really spectacular review.
4125.47 This was a review that was
published in the year 2018,
4128.15 so it's fairly recent,
4129.34 first author Thomas, Ewan Thomas,
4131.51 last author Palma.
4132.92 We will put a link to this
in the show note caption.
4135.09 The title of the paper
4136.05 is The Relation Between
Stretching Typology
4138.43 and Stretching Duration: The
Effects on Range of Motion.
4140.917 It's a very straightforward title.
4144.16 This is a review article that explored
4147.38 a number of different studies,
4150.38 had criteria for whether
or not those studies
4152.1 could be evaluated in the
context of the questions here,
4155.51 had some quality standards
and some other standards
4157.65 that they applied.
4158.483 And basically, windowed down
a large collection of studies
4162.44 to a remaining 23 articles
4164.9 that were able to be
considered quote, "Eligible
4167.85 and included in the quantitative
synthesis done here."
4170.91 So, key points from that quantification
4175.0 and synthesis done in this paper.
4177.14 First of all, and I quote,
"All stretching typologies
4180.16 showed range of motion improvements
over a long-term period.
4183.26 However, the static protocols
showed significant gains
4186.95 with a p-value less than .05,"
4188.61 which means a probability
that cannot be explained
4192.24 by chance alone,
4194.007 "When compared to ballistic
or PNF protocols."
4196.52 So, again, that we're hearing
is that static stretching
4198.75 is the preferred mode for
increasing limb range of motion.
4202.08 Although, here they make
the additional point
4204.66 that static stretching
might even be superior,
4207.74 not just to ballistic stretching,
but also to PNF protocols.
4212.94 Because before, as you may recall,
4215.04 there was a distinction
between ballistic and dynamic,
4219.98 and static and PNF.
4221.34 And so, here it appears
again that static stretching
4224.29 is sort of rising to the top of the list
4227.27 as the optimal approach
4228.62 relative to all other
stretching approaches,
4231.73 at least in the context of
increasing limb range of motion.
4236.55 The authors go on to say,
"Time spent stretching per week
4239.8 seems fundamental to elicit
range of movement improvements
4242.74 when stretches are applied
for at least or more
4245.32 than five minutes per week."
4247.72 Okay, this is critical.
4248.89 This is not five minutes per stretch.
4250.94 Remember, 30 seconds per static stretch,
4253.13 but at least five minutes per week.
4255.49 Whereas the time spent stretching
within a single session
4258.7 does not seem to have a significant effect
4260.47 for range of motion gains.
4261.64 If this is getting confusing,
4262.96 I'll make sure that you soon understand
4265.03 exactly what we can export
from these conclusions.
4269.95 The data indicated that
performing stretching
4271.73 at least five days a week.
4274.63 Now, some of you may already be groaning,
4276.66 for at least five minutes per week.
4278.77 Okay, so five days per week, that's a lot,
4281.14 but at least five minutes per week,
4283.2 five minutes per week is not that much.
4284.967 "Using static stretching may be beneficial
4287.4 to promote range of motion improvements."
4290.27 Okay, I've read this study in detail now,
4293.04 they highlight, again, the
reduction in flexibility
4295.34 that occurs from 20-49
years of age and so on,
4298.85 how acute bouts of short-term stretching
4301.13 up to three weeks can
improve stretch tolerance.
4303.42 I think that's a key point
that in the short-term,
4306.03 the first three weeks of embarking
4307.4 on a stretching and flexibility program,
4310.01 much of the improvements
come from the short-term
4312.34 neural improvements that
we talked about before
4314.13 of inhibiting the
spindle reflex and so on.
4315.98 And also, a stretch tolerance,
4317.57 a comfort with doing the movements
4319.11 and maybe even a comfort in overriding
4320.71 some of the pain mechanisms.
4321.78 I'll talk a little bit more
about that in just a bit
4324.22 and the particular utility of yoga.
4327.74 Something that I don't often practice,
4329.86 but that after reading this article
4331.38 that I'll mention in a little bit,
4332.75 I'm considering perhaps taking up
4334.46 some form of yoga protocol.
4337.3 Now, I've already highlighted
4338.41 some of the key take aways from the study,
4340.67 namely that we need to get at
least five minutes per week
4345.15 of static stretching per muscle group.
4347.71 And based on the previous
paper that we talked about,
4351.98 we need to divide that five minutes
4353.57 into sets of 30 seconds each.
4356.62 And as I mentioned earlier,
4358.71 it doesn't seem to be the case
4360.11 that you can do all of that
in one day, unfortunately.
4364.13 It does seem important that the frequency
4366.36 of stretching practice
4367.56 distributed throughout
the week is important.
4370.12 So, let's talk protocols.
4372.19 We are now talking about
doing static stretching,
4374.28 so holding, so limiting momentum
4376.05 and holding a stretch
for 30 seconds per set.
4378.5 We're talking about trying to achieve
4381.03 five minutes per week
of those static holds,
4384.0 but that we can't do it all in one session
4388.07 because the frequency of sessions
4390.16 distributed throughout the week
4391.47 correlates with the improvements
in limb range of motion.
4394.41 So, what this means is that
we should probably be doing
4397.67 anywhere from two to four sets
4400.63 of 30 second static holds stretches
4405.43 five days per week or
some variant thereof.
4409.66 And I do say some variant
thereof because it turns out
4412.41 that even though there
was that earlier study
4414.02 that we talked about
4415.18 that holding a stretch
for more than 30 seconds,
4417.98 in that case 60 seconds,
4419.58 didn't turn out to be
additionally beneficial.
4422.4 It appears that if you
do hold those stretches
4425.07 for 60 seconds per static
stretching set, for instance,
4429.08 you can get away with stretching
4430.9 fewer days per week overall.
4433.41 So, in order to make
this as clear as possible
4436.95 'cause I do realize there
are a lot of parameters
4439.35 and you might be asking,
4440.457 "Why didn't you just make me a list
4441.7 of the exact things I should do?"
4443.04 Well, it doesn't work that way
4444.17 because once you understand the mechanisms
4446.13 and once you understand
your particular goals,
4448.45 this information is designed
for you to be able to construct
4451.26 a stretching program that is tailored
4453.13 to your specific goals.
4454.61 If I just gave you the stretching
program that I'm doing,
4456.99 or I should say that I'm soon to be doing
4458.54 'cause I'm soon to be doing one
4459.8 based on the research for
this particular episode.
4463.56 Well, that wouldn't be beneficial for you
4465.49 because, for instance, if you
have very flexible hamstrings,
4468.39 but not very flexible quadriceps,
4470.33 or you are somebody
who is engaged in sport
4472.94 or not engaged in sport,
4474.95 what you need to do is
going to vary somewhat.
4476.95 So, what would effective
stretching protocol look like?
4480.37 We're all trying to improve
limb range of motion
4482.63 for different limbs and
different muscle groups.
4485.93 But just by way of example,
4487.24 and it's because the one we've been using,
4488.44 let's talk about hamstrings
for the time being.
4491.58 This could, of course, be
applied to other muscle groups.
4494.27 Let's say you want to
improve hamstring flexibility
4497.06 and limb range of motion
about and around the hamstring
4501.04 and involving the hamstring,
4503.66 you would want to do three sets
4506.77 of static stretching for the hamstring.
4509.06 Again, easy to find such
exercises on the internet.
4513.73 You would do that by holding
the stretch for 30 seconds,
4518.24 resting some period of time,
4519.75 and doing it again,
holding for 30 seconds,
4521.83 resting some period of time,
4523.14 and then holding it for 30 seconds.
4526.31 That would be one training
session for the hamstrings.
4528.73 I have to imagine that you'd
probably want to stretch
4530.83 other muscle groups as
well in that same session.
4533.55 Although, at least as far as I could tell,
4534.99 there was no data pointing to the fact
4537.0 that you couldn't do
your hamstring stretching
4538.9 one part of the day
4539.733 and your quadricep stretching
another part of the day.
4542.02 But presumably, you're
going to want to combine
4544.21 your flexibility training
into one single session.
4547.95 So, three sets of 30 seconds each
4552.21 get 90 seconds,
4553.61 and you would do that
ideally five times a week
4557.0 or maybe even more
4558.06 because it does seem like frequency
4559.72 distributed throughout the
week is an important parameter.
4562.03 Now, one thing that we
have not highlighted
4564.47 or at least described
4565.69 is how long to rest
between stretching sets.
4569.18 And despite my efforts,
4571.36 I could not find
research-backed information
4575.59 that pointed to whether
or not 30 seconds of rest
4578.78 for every 30 seconds stretching,
4580.18 or 60 seconds rest for every
30 second stretching was ideal.
4584.83 I think it's reasonable to assume
4586.3 that doubling the amount of time
4588.96 for the interleaving rest
4590.74 would be appropriate or at least doable.
4593.74 If anyone out there has
knowledge about rest
4595.98 between stretching sets
and has some physiology,
4599.46 or some biology, or some
experiential information
4602.75 as to why a given ratio of
duration of static stretch
4607.01 to rest in between static
stretch sets ought to be used,
4610.26 please put it in the comments on YouTube,
4612.42 that'd be a terrific way for
us to get that information.
4614.49 I'd love to do any follow-up
4615.55 to links that you provide and so on.
4618.66 But now, we're starting
to build into a protocol
4622.09 that is backed by the scientific data.
4624.95 Three sets of 30 seconds of holds
4627.63 done five times or maybe
even six times per week.
4631.41 One thing that did show
up in my exploration
4634.77 of the peer-reviewed research
4636.3 is this notion of warming up for all this.
4638.41 We haven't talked about that yet.
4640.75 In general, to avoid injury,
4642.16 it's a good idea to raise your
core body temperature a bit
4644.47 before doing these kinds of stretches.
4647.15 Even these static stretches,
4648.46 which we can sort of ease into
4649.9 and don't involve ballistic
movement by definition.
4653.87 And the basic take away
that I was able to find
4657.47 was that if we are
already warm from running,
4661.25 or from weight training,
or from some other activity
4664.48 that doing the static stretching
4666.67 practice at the end of
that weight training,
4669.51 or cardiovascular, or
other physical session
4671.9 would allow us to go immediately
into the stretching session
4675.6 because we're already warm, so to speak.
4677.84 Otherwise, raising one's core
body temperature by a bit
4681.57 by doing five to seven,
maybe even 10 minutes
4684.66 of easy cardiovascular exercise
or calisthenic movements,
4688.45 provided you can do those
without getting injured,
4691.13 seems to be an ideal way to
warm up the body for stretching.
4693.72 We should be warm or warm-up to stretch,
4696.56 although those warm-ups
4697.393 don't have to be extremely extensive.
4699.23 And then, just by way of logic,
4700.9 doing the static stretching
after resistance training
4703.68 or cardiovascular training
seems to be most beneficial.
4706.34 In fact, and unfortunately
we don't have time
4708.46 to go into this in too much detail today,
4710.45 I was able to find a number of
papers that make the argument
4714.26 that static stretching prior
to cardiovascular training
4718.1 and maybe even prior
to resistance training
4721.84 can limit our performance
4723.62 in running and resistance training.
4726.09 I realize that's a controversial area,
4728.29 you have those who say, "No,
it's immensely beneficial,"
4731.35 you have those who say, "No,
it inhibits performance,"
4733.957 and those that say, "No, it's a matter
4736.22 of how exactly you perform
that static stretching,
4738.077 and which muscle groups,
and how you're doing this,
4740.23 and how much time in between
4742.38 static stretching and performance."
4743.75 But to leave all that aside,
4745.7 doing static stretching after
some other form of exercise
4749.57 and if not after some form of exercise,
4752.86 after a brief warm-up to raise
your core body temperature
4755.55 definitely seems like the right way to go.
4757.55 Now, for some of you out there,
4758.68 and I confess for me as well,
4760.72 doing something five days a week
4762.18 seems like a big commitment,
4763.23 even if that commitment is
one to only do three sets
4766.02 of 30 second static stretches.
4768.86 I say this because you've got the warm-up,
4771.36 I generally like to
bring a kind of a focus
4773.5 and dedication to a practice.
4775.1 And, of course, because when
doing these kinds of protocols,
4780.0 it's likely that you're not
just stretching your hamstring,
4781.94 so it's not just 90 seconds of work
4783.7 with a minute of rest in between,
4785.58 but very likely that we're also
doing quadricep stretching,
4788.48 and also doing stretching
for the shoulders,
4790.25 and stretching for the back,
and the neck, and so on.
4792.36 And so, that entire session
is going to take some time,
4794.83 and five days a week is a
pretty serious commitment
4797.1 for most, especially for those
of us that don't exercise
4800.25 or do athletics for a
living, which I don't.
4803.66 So, there is some evidence
from the literature
4806.4 that one can get away with,
4808.06 or I don't even know that
we should think about it
4809.69 as getting away with,
4810.523 but that one can do longer
hold static stretches
4814.15 of up to say 60 seconds,
4817.29 but do fewer total sessions per week.
4820.97 So, rather than three
30 second static holds,
4824.26 doing three 60 second static holds
4827.53 and doing those every other day.
4830.14 And there really hasn't been
4831.58 a systematic exploration of this.
4833.13 The article that I was referring
to just a few moments ago,
4837.33 this analysis of the 23 articles
4840.73 was combined into this
enormous set of tables
4843.15 and some really quite nice graphs
4845.35 that you're welcome to look at
4846.77 since we're going to
provide a link to the study.
4849.09 There are a couple of key take
aways that I want to mention
4852.08 that are separate from this issue
4853.27 of how long to stretch and how often.
4855.97 First of all, they describe
in their discussion
4859.64 that there were improvements
in range of motion
4863.34 independent of whether or not
people did static stretching,
4867.08 active stretching, passive stretching,
4868.83 ballistic stretching, or PNF stretching.
4871.97 So, all of those forms of stretching
4873.65 will improve limb range of motion.
4875.51 This is essential to point out
4877.17 and I want to emphasize this.
4879.33 Static stretching, however,
4881.77 gave the greatest degree of
gains in limb range of motion.
4885.95 And on average, they saw a 20.9% increase,
4889.79 but some of the other
increases they observed
4892.24 were also quite substantial.
4894.19 So, ballistic stretching can also provide
4896.68 some pretty impressive limb
range of motion improvements.
4900.53 However, they tended to be in the range
4902.16 of, here they point out, 11.65% increase,
4905.96 or in the case of PNF, a 15% increase.
4908.4 So, it appears that the
greatest improvements
4911.3 in limb range of motion for
your time spent and effort spent
4915.2 is going to be this minimum
of five minutes per week
4918.6 to elicit a significant response
4920.14 with five days being the minimum
4921.68 weekly recommended frequency
4923.26 to achieve significant range
of motion improvements.
4927.46 I confess, this was
pretty surprising to me
4930.35 when I compare flexibility training
4933.26 to, say, resistance training
for strength and hypertrophy.
4936.41 I've had the experience,
4937.4 and I know that other people
have had the experience,
4939.13 and I think Dr. Andy
Galpin would probably agree
4943.29 that provided one trains
hard enough and appropriately
4947.11 that you don't need to
train resistance training
4950.73 five days a week in order to
get significant improvements
4953.78 in strength and hypertrophy.
4954.88 Some people might need to,
4956.22 but you can get a lot of positive results
4959.1 in those variables with
less frequent training,
4962.19 certainly with three or four
days a week of training.
4965.64 And for cardiovascular training,
4967.29 I'm not aware of anyone having tested
4969.24 whether or not one very long run each week
4971.41 can actually increase
cardiovascular fitness
4973.27 and you're not doing anything else.
4974.35 Although, I have to
imagine you'd probably see
4975.97 some improvement compared
to not doing anything,
4978.06 but most people are doing
repeated training sessions
4981.67 of cardiovascular strength training.
4984.13 Not a lot of people are
doing five days a week
4986.9 of strength training, at
least that I'm aware of.
4989.53 Some people are, but most
people I think are not.
4992.17 And some people are
doing five or more days
4995.14 a week of cardiovascular training.
4997.44 I'm guessing that most people
are not doing five days a week
5000.71 of dedicated static stretch
5002.68 range of motion directed training,
5005.77 but it does appear that that
frequency about the week
5009.25 getting those repeated sessions,
5010.49 even if they are short for
an individual muscle group,
5012.82 turns out to be important.
5014.04 And so, that points to perhaps the reason
5017.49 why so few people are doing
dedicated range of motion work,
5020.51 but it also reminds me
that all of the studies
5024.59 that were described at
least in this review
5026.64 and some of the other ones that were not
5028.73 really show impressive changes
in limb range of motion.
5032.16 I mean, 20+%, or even 15% with PNF,
5036.18 I mean, these are big changes
that are going to benefit us,
5039.07 they're going to offset
the age-related losses
5041.5 in flexibility, for sure,
5043.32 if one is dedicated about these practices.
5045.58 And in many cases,
5047.3 they're going to increase
limb range of motion
5049.5 in ways that are going to
allow us better performance
5052.3 in certain physical endeavors,
certainly better balance.
5055.183 All right, we haven't really talked
5056.06 about balance and stability,
5057.33 but range of motion can
impair balance and stability
5061.23 in some extreme circumstances,
5062.77 but by and large, limb range
of motion, lack of tightness,
5065.59 improved posture, improved
physical performance, excuse me.
5069.3 And things of that sort is something
5071.41 that I think we can all benefit from,
5072.717 and that are key features of longevity.
5075.63 We don't often think of them
5076.66 because we so prioritize
cardiovascular health
5079.04 and the relationship between
the heart and brain health,
5080.96 and resistance training, and
musculoskeletal hypertrophy,
5085.87 or strength, et cetera.
5087.16 But as I delved into this literature,
5089.47 it really highlighted for me the extent
5091.25 to which having really
good limb range of motion,
5094.82 at least maintaining limb range of motion
5096.92 as we age from year to year,
5099.02 and maybe even improving
limb range of motion
5101.44 can be immensely beneficial
for reducing pain
5104.73 for, again, improving posture,
5107.19 improving our ability to
perform, to walk, et cetera.
5110.24 And indeed, there's a whole literature
5112.45 that relates our limb range of motion
5114.68 to things like pain management
5116.43 of things related to headache
and so on and so forth.
5119.18 So, limb range of motion is not just about
5121.82 becoming a contortionist
5123.01 or being able to complete the yoga class,
5125.33 it really is about maintaining
the integrity and the health
5127.86 of the neuromuscular system,
the connective tissue,
5131.39 and the neuromuscular connective network
5133.88 because those are indeed
working as an ecosystem
5136.31 and a network.
5137.19 I'd like to just briefly touch
5138.49 on PNF stretching for a moment.
5142.33 Again, this is a vast landscape
5143.83 with many parameters and
different practitioners,
5145.83 a lot of competing opinions out there,
5150.95 to put it lightly.
5152.29 Nonetheless, I do want to
emphasize that the PNF training
5155.72 leverages those spindle mechanisms
5157.53 and GTO mechanisms that
we talked about earlier,
5160.59 but I realize that in describing
the quadricep contraction,
5163.92 hamstring stretch little mini-experiment
5166.83 that hopefully you did,
5168.75 that I didn't really highlight
the role of the GTOs,
5171.24 the Golgi tendon organs that much.
5173.27 And I just would like to just
briefly do that for a moment.
5176.27 The GTOs have multiple functions.
5180.34 In fact, I think even though GTOs
5182.11 are in every medical textbook,
every physiology textbook,
5184.77 every first year neuroscientist
learns about them
5187.69 when learning about the
neuromuscular junctions
5189.46 and the mechanisms of
interoception, et cetera,
5192.21 they're likely to have
other functions as well.
5194.67 And one of the reasons why
PNF stretching does work,
5199.75 whether or not you're
doing that by using a strap
5202.33 to pull back a limb,
5204.04 or whether or not you're
actively contracting
5206.45 your quadriceps to then
release and emphasize
5210.27 stretch range of motion
for your hamstrings
5212.62 and related muscle groups is
that activation of those GTOs,
5218.06 meaning putting loads and
tension into that system
5222.54 can inhibit the spindles
5224.83 in the opposite
antagonistic muscle groups.
5227.53 Okay, so one of the reasons why flexing,
5231.32 or I should say
contracting your quadriceps
5234.5 really intensely for some period of time
5236.75 allows your hamstrings to
subsequently experience
5240.0 greater range of motion.
5241.66 And again, it's not just the hamstrings,
5243.04 but the related connective tissue
5244.81 and neural circuits, et cetera
5247.16 is because yes, it's
quote-unquote relaxing
5252.11 the hamstrings and the spindle,
5254.27 but there's also a direct relationship
5257.96 between activation of
the GTOs in the quadricep
5262.1 and release of the spindles
5265.8 in the hamstring and related muscles.
5267.42 This has a name, it's
called autogenic inhibition,
5269.95 it's a fancy name for
contraction of one muscle group
5273.73 providing a relaxation
of the other muscle group
5277.16 that's antagonistic to it.
5279.31 And it relates back to this idea
5280.93 of interleaving sets in the gym.
5282.66 So, if you think back to that example,
5285.08 now it should make sense
as to why, for instance,
5288.32 if you do, let's say,
a set of bench presses
5290.78 or shoulder presses,
5292.1 and you let's say you get 10 repetitions
5294.5 and you fail on the 11th,
5296.06 that muscle is very, very fatigued.
5298.34 If you were to rest some period of time
5300.27 and then go back and do another set,
5302.91 well, during the rest, that
muscle group has been relaxing,
5306.12 it's obviously not
contracting the same way
5307.67 it was during the resistance set,
5309.87 but by going and doing a pulling exercise
5312.58 that involves the
antagonistic muscle group,
5314.6 so strongly contracting the
back muscles through a pull
5317.36 like a pull-down, or a chin-up,
or a row-type exercise,
5321.66 you're activating or near
activating the GTO system
5326.03 in those pulling muscles in a way
5327.89 that provides autogenic inhibition
for the pushing muscles.
5332.81 Now, again, the physios out there
5335.53 are probably either screaming
5337.41 or banging their heads
against whatever sound system
5339.98 this happens to be arriving
through to them saying, "Wait,
5342.69 but in many cases, the GTOs
aren't activated enough
5345.84 to provide that autogenic inhibition."
5347.63 That's true, but even the
sub-threshold activation
5351.71 of those intraspinal circuits,
5353.52 so the place where the GTO circuit
5355.75 and the spindle circuit interact,
5357.54 can provide an additional replenishment
5360.92 of, say, the pushing muscles
5362.94 while you're activating
those pulling muscles.
5364.76 And this is at least one, not the only,
5366.71 but at least one mechanism
5368.1 by which interleaving push
and pull, push and pull
5370.97 for both strength and
hypertrophy training,
5373.11 but also for range of motion
stretching-type training
5377.56 can allow you to achieve better results
5380.67 in a shorter period of time.
5382.34 And I raise this because
I want to keep in mind
5384.99 the efficiency of any training program.
5387.27 We just a moment ago
established that doing,
5390.49 for example, three sets
of 30 second static holds
5393.32 can be very useful for the hamstrings
5394.94 with let's just say for sake
of simplicity and practicality
5399.02 a minute's rest in between.
5400.67 But during that minute's rest,
5402.53 you can stretch the opposite
antagonistic muscle group,
5406.39 such as the quadriceps,
5408.38 or if you want to use PNF training,
5410.77 you could do loading of
the quadriceps in between.
5413.84 So, there are a number of different ways
5415.06 in which you can start to
interleave static stretching
5419.13 with PNF stretching,
5420.87 you can start to interleave
even PNF-type protocols
5424.55 with resistance training,
5425.55 although that gets a bit more complicated.
5427.8 You can really start to construct
5429.26 and build protocols
that are ideal for you.
5432.74 What we will do
5433.573 is for an upcoming Neural
Network Newsletter.
5436.89 So, for those of you that aren't familiar,
5438.2 the Huberman Lab Podcast
5439.22 has a so-called Neural Network Newsletter,
5440.96 these are monthly newsletters
where we put distilled points
5444.57 from the podcast and oftentimes protocols
5447.01 in a downloadable PDF form.
5448.87 You can access it by giving us your email,
5450.41 we don't share your email with anybody.
5451.91 If you want to see examples of these,
5453.12 you can go to hubermanlab.com
5454.61 and go to the menu and see Newsletter,
5456.31 you don't have to sign up for anything
5457.4 to see examples of what these are like.
5459.52 I'll provide a couple
of different protocols,
5461.92 one that is pure static stretching,
5464.67 one that involves PNF-type stretching,
5467.84 and I'll also put down a protocol
5470.83 that involves the antagonistic
interleaved muscle training
5474.03 of the sort that I've been describing
5475.2 a few times throughout this episode.
5476.94 And then, you can try and apply those
5478.81 either separately or maybe
combine them in some way
5481.7 that's useful for your goals.
5483.25 There are a couple of key
elements that are essential
5485.48 for building a safe and
effective range of motion
5488.97 increasing program that arrived to us
5491.46 both through the peer-reviewed research
5493.28 and, admittedly, from people
that have been involved
5496.02 in teaching and training range of motion
5498.54 for a very long period of time.
5500.38 Some of you may be familiar
5501.63 with the so-called Anderson method,
5503.22 it's been around for a long time.
5505.21 Actually have never met Anderson,
5506.73 I don't, I should know this,
5508.04 I don't even know if he's still alive,
5509.32 I hope he's still alive,
5510.51 but in any event, there are
a lot of different features
5513.1 to the Anderson and other protocols.
5515.21 But one of the aspects
of the Anderson protocol
5517.76 that I think is highly relevant.
5519.36 In fact, I know is relevant
to the peer-reviewed research
5521.54 that we're going to talk
about in a few moments
5523.62 is this notion of pushing through pain,
5526.87 and how active or how passive
to be about static stretching.
5530.79 Now, this is somewhat subjective.
5532.61 Right, if you think about
getting into a stretch,
5535.73 again, we'll just use the
hamstrings for example.
5537.59 So, you're either reaching
for your toes while seated,
5541.52 or maybe you're using a strap
5543.87 and you're raising your foot
overhead while lying down,
5547.14 or maybe you're doing a
toe touch-type exercise.
5552.83 How far should you reach?
5554.07 Where is the end range of motion?
5556.27 Should you balance?
Should you not balance?
5557.81 We're going to talk a little
bit more about that in a moment,
5560.06 but Anderson has an
interesting idea and principle,
5562.7 which has thread through
a lot of his teachings
5565.01 that I think are very much
in keeping with the study
5567.89 that I'm about to describe next,
5569.71 where he emphasizes to yes,
5573.22 to stretch to the end
of the range of motion,
5576.56 but not to focus so much on
where that range of motion
5579.37 happens to be that day.
5581.35 So, for instance, not thinking, "Oh,
5584.06 I can always touch my toes, for instance.
5586.92 And therefore that's the starting place
5589.29 for my flexibility training today."
5591.86 But rather to take the entirety
of your system into account
5595.76 each day and understand that, okay,
5597.37 provided your warmed up appropriately,
5599.81 that you're now going to
stretch your hamstrings,
5601.46 for instance, and you're going
to reach down for your toes,
5604.54 but that your range of motion
might be adjusted that day
5607.61 by way of tension and stress,
5609.72 or by way of ambient
temperature in the room.
5611.96 And to basically define
the end range of motion
5614.69 as the place where you
can feel the stretch
5617.82 in the relevant muscle groups.
5619.42 I think this is important
5620.56 because unlike resistance training
5623.2 or cardiovascular training,
5624.82 where we can measure
distance traveled over time
5627.44 in the case of cardiovascular training,
5628.9 or how much weight is on the bar,
5630.55 and count repetitions, et cetera.
5632.9 With range of motion training,
5634.89 of course, range of motion is the feature
5637.02 that we're interested in,
5638.23 but there is likely to be a lot
of variation from day-to-day
5642.25 based on a number of different internal
5644.09 and external factors.
5645.54 And so, the Anderson method
5646.9 is really about getting into static
5648.89 and other forms of stretching.
5650.53 I think today we've mainly been focusing
5652.12 on static stretching and
holding the end range of motion,
5655.35 but really paying attention
to the feel of the stretch
5657.947 and the muscles involved.
5659.51 And there are parallels in resistance
5661.56 and cardiovascular training
too I realize, right?
5663.85 In the case of trying
to build hypertrophy,
5666.26 or I should say improve
hypertrophy, muscle size,
5669.2 oftentimes the best
advice that one can give
5672.22 is to don't try to lift weights,
5673.97 but rather to challenge muscles.
5675.44 Now, of course, you need
to provide adequate loads
5677.26 in order to get hypertrophy,
5678.8 but when you're training
purely for strength,
5680.45 it's about moving weights.
5682.52 When you're training
purely for hypertrophy
5684.21 or mainly for hypertrophy,
5685.31 it's really about challenging
muscles using weights
5688.03 or other forms of resistance.
5689.53 And similarly, and in keeping
with this Anderson method,
5694.08 when trying to build limb range of motion,
5697.3 doing static stretching at a
place where it's difficult,
5700.8 but that you can experience
the stretch of the muscle
5703.81 cognitively, consciously being
able to focus on the muscles
5707.82 and their stretch is at least as useful
5710.88 as is evaluating the
current range of motion
5713.88 you're able to achieve.
5714.713 So, what does this mean?
5715.546 This means feel the muscles
as you stretch them,
5717.44 don't just go through the motions.
5718.75 And this means don't get so attached
5721.39 to being able to always achieve,
5723.07 for instance, a stretch
of a given distance
5725.73 within a given session.
5726.93 You might actually find that
by just finding the place
5730.26 where you can't get much further
5732.15 and holding the static stretch there,
5734.28 that on the second and third set
5735.72 that you happen to be doing that day,
5736.86 that your range of motion will
be increased considerably.
5740.14 Maybe not, but very likely yes, you will.
5742.61 And, of course, evaluating
range of motion over time
5746.22 is the key parameter
5747.36 because that's the goal
of all this type of work.
5749.68 Now, along these lines,
5752.95 there is this variable that
we've mentioned a few times
5755.27 of passive versus active stretching,
5757.38 and there's this even
more nebulous variable,
5760.38 this even more kind of subjective thing
5762.15 of how much effort to put into it?
5765.56 Should you push into the stretch?
5767.2 Would you even want to balance a tiny bit?
5769.54 Would you want to reach
into that end point
5772.63 and try and extend it within
a given set and session?
5776.0 And for that reason,
5778.18 I was excited to find this paper
5780.55 entitled A Comparison of
Two Stretching Modalities
5782.85 on Lower-Limb Range of Motion Measurements
5784.94 in Recreational Dancers.
5786.96 Happens to be done in
recreational dancers,
5788.68 it's a six-week intervention program
5790.72 that compared low-intensity stretching,
5792.69 which they call Microstretching.
5794.95 They used a capital M,
5795.98 so I don't know if that
means that it's proprietary,
5797.98 although I didn't see evidence
of a conflict of interest,
5801.69 but they call it Microstretching.
5803.46 But to be very clear,
5806.537 Microstretching in the
case of this manuscript
5808.77 is low-intensity stretching.
5810.85 And they compared that
5811.683 with moderate intensity static stretching
5814.51 on an active and passive ranges of motion.
5816.92 Okay, so there are a lot of
different variables are here,
5818.94 but I'll just highlight
a few of the things
5821.44 that are really most relevant to us,
5823.17 and I'll give you the
take away at the outset
5825.08 and then return to it at the end
5826.53 so that if I lose any of your attention
5829.45 in the next couple of minutes,
5830.41 at least you have that key take away.
5834.14 Basically, what they found
5835.22 was that a six-week training program
5837.05 using very low-intensity stretching
5839.82 had a greater positive effect
on lower limb range of motion
5842.93 than did moderate-intensity
static stretching.
5846.09 I find that incredibly
interesting, so very low intensity,
5848.83 and we'll define what
that means in a moment.
5852.01 Here, I'm quoting them,
5853.587 "The most interesting aspect of the study
5855.3 was the greater increase
in active range of motion
5857.81 compared to passive range of motion
5859.39 by the Microstretching group."
5860.76 So, this relates to what
we were just talking about
5862.67 a few moments ago as it
relates to the Anderson method,
5865.83 which is that very
low-intensity stretching,
5869.99 meaning effort that feels not painful
5873.7 and in fact might even feel
easy or at least not straining
5879.48 to exceed a given range of motion
5882.74 turns out to not just be as effective,
5884.96 but more effective than
moderate-intensity stretching.
5888.68 So, what is low-intensity
static stretching?
5891.12 Well, they define this as
the stretches were completed
5893.67 at an intensity of 30-40%
5897.35 where 100% equals the
point of pain, right?
5900.87 So, 30-40% in these individuals,
5904.49 and again, I'm paraphrasing,
5905.68 induced a relaxed state
within the individual
5908.64 and the specific muscle.
5909.73 And here they were holding
these static stretches
5911.71 I should mention for one
minute, not 30 seconds.
5915.37 Now, the control group
5916.9 was doing the exact same overall protocol,
5919.59 so daily stretching for six weeks,
5922.7 the same exercises, holding
each set for 60 seconds,
5927.17 but were using an
intensity of stretch of 80%
5931.35 where, again, 100
represents the point of pain
5934.72 or the point where the person
would want to stop stretching.
5938.28 I find these data incredibly interesting
5939.94 for, I think, what ought
to be obvious reasons.
5942.52 If you're going to embark on a flexibility
5945.39 and stretching training program,
5947.78 you don't need to push
to the point of pain.
5949.92 In fact, it seems that
even just approaching
5952.62 the point of pain is
going to be less effective
5955.12 than operating at this 30-40% of intensity
5960.4 prior to reaching that pain threshold.
5961.98 The pain threshold being 100%.
5963.62 Now, of course, this is pretty subjective,
5965.12 but I think all of us should be able
5967.29 to register within ourselves,
5969.06 so whether a given range of motion
5971.59 or extending a given range of motion
5973.01 brings us to that threshold
of pain or near pain.
5975.77 And according to this study at least,
5979.13 operating or performing stretching
5981.64 at an intensity that's quite
low, that's very relaxing
5984.77 turns out to be more beneficial
5986.96 in increasing range of motion
5988.57 than is doing exercises aimed
at increasing range of motion
5992.84 at a higher intensity.
5994.41 Okay, so lower intensity stretching,
5996.81 I should say lower
intensity static stretching
5999.38 appears to be the most beneficial way
6001.48 to approach stretching.
6002.313 And I think that's a relief
probably to many of us
6005.63 because it also suggests
that the injury risk
6008.76 is going to be lower
than if one were pushing
6010.81 into the pain zone, so to speak.
6013.0 The authors offer a number
of different explanations
6015.21 as to why this approach, this
Microstretching approach,
6017.94 might be more effective.
6020.13 Here, I'm paraphrasing
from their discussion
6022.46 where they mentioned that
it could be hypothesized
6025.81 that they had improved
reciprocal inhibition
6028.67 within the hamstring muscle group.
6029.89 So, this gets right back to
the sorts of neural mechanisms
6031.99 that we talked about before,
6032.94 that somehow by doing this
low-intensity stretching
6035.81 that they were able to
access some of those spindle
6037.76 and GTO-type mechanisms that
we were referring to earlier,
6041.03 and the inhibition of hamstring
and quadricep stretches.
6044.63 They also offer a number
of different ideas
6047.16 about how this could shift the activation
6050.67 of the so-called sympathetic,
6051.87 remember the kind of stress
division of our nervous system,
6055.55 and to reduce that relative
6058.68 to activation of the parasympathetic arm
6060.76 of the nervous system.
6061.97 I confess, they have a couple of arguments
6063.69 around sympathetic, parasympathetic
6065.33 that are somewhat convoluted.
6066.95 I will just in fairness
to the neuroscience
6070.94 on those systems,
6073.04 I wouldn't suggest putting too much weight
6075.3 on their arguments about
sympathetic and parasympathetic.
6078.02 To my mind, they didn't
really hold much water,
6080.37 but here I'm not trying to be disparaging
6082.38 of the overall work, which I
think is really quite sound,
6085.01 which is that low intensity,
so called Microstretching,
6088.53 is going to be the most effective way
6090.41 to increase limb range
of movement over time.
6093.25 I want to just briefly return to this idea
6095.26 of whether or not to do
ballistic or static stretching
6097.93 before some sort of skill training,
6100.5 or weight training, or any kind of sport,
6103.76 or even cardiovascular
exercise like running.
6107.25 Again, the data are
really split out there.
6109.29 There are even folks who suggest
6110.98 that doing any kind of
stretching prior to running
6113.5 is going to lower running efficiency,
6115.25 it's going to require
essentially more work
6116.907 and more oxygen uptake at a given speed
6120.1 for a variety of reasons,
6121.22 and runners and that community
argue about this endlessly.
6124.7 There are papers in both
sides, in both directions,
6126.81 I'm sure I'll hear about
some of this in the comments.
6129.07 I'm not really going to take a
stance on this as a consequence
6132.18 because the data are all over the place.
6134.6 However, I think there's a
general logic that we can apply,
6137.56 and here I'm borrowing
from some conversations
6140.44 and some information put out
there by Dr. Andy Galpin,
6143.25 who I think is, of course, both an expert
6145.98 and thinks about these things
6146.813 in a really sound and
flexible way, no pun intended.
6151.88 There are instances, for example,
6154.95 where an individual might want
to do some static stretching
6157.75 to increase limb range of motion
6159.56 prior to doing weight training
6161.16 even if it's going to
inhibit that person's ability
6164.71 to lift as much weight.
6166.36 Why would you want to do that?
6167.39 Well, for instance,
6168.62 if somebody has a
tightness or a limitation
6170.98 in their neuromuscular
connective tissue system
6173.6 someplace in their body and system
6176.62 that prevents them from using proper form,
6180.04 that they can overcome by
doing some static stretching.
6183.75 Well, that would be a great idea
6185.51 as Dr. Galpin points out.
6187.64 Or for instance, if proper
stability within the movement
6191.51 requires increasing limb
range of motion in some way,
6194.57 well then compromising
the use of greater loads
6198.75 could be greatly offset by
doing some static stretching
6202.05 to improve, say, hamstring flexibility
6203.88 or another muscle group flexibility.
6205.6 So, we can't always think about
6206.61 just what's going to allow us
6208.37 or inhibit us from using
the maximal amount of weight
6211.01 or from running as far as we want to run
6213.72 as fast as we want to run.
6215.26 There are instances where
people are trying to overcome
6217.39 injuries where they're trying to come back
6219.96 from a repetitive surgery
6221.87 or something of that sort,
coming back from a layoff
6224.08 where some additional static stretching
6227.13 prior to cardiovascular,
or weight training,
6229.3 or skill training, or sport of some kind
6231.17 is going to be useful
because it's going to put us
6234.04 in a position of greater safety
6235.66 and confidence and performance overall,
6238.22 even if it's adjusting down our speed
6240.72 or the total amount of loads that we use.
6242.92 So, it's you that needs to consider
6245.64 whether or not for you and
within a given training session
6249.45 you want to do static training,
6252.19 I should say static stretching
range of motion training
6255.01 prior to or after that training session.
6258.57 And similarly, there are a lot of data
6262.18 pointing to the fact
that doing some dynamic
6264.16 or even ballistic stretching
prior to skill training,
6267.45 or cardiovascular, or weight
training can be beneficial
6270.0 in part to warm-up the
relevant neural circuits,
6272.41 joints, and connective
tissue, and muscles,
6275.04 and as well to perhaps
improve range of motion
6278.8 or ability to perform those
movements more accurately,
6282.16 with more stability, and
therefore with more confidence.
6285.2 And while Dr. Andy Galpin
6286.87 would never name any
protocol after himself,
6289.24 he's far too humble to do that,
6290.75 I've named a couple of
protocols after him,
6292.81 particularly the Galpin
equation for hydration,
6295.66 because he was willing to
stick his neck out there
6298.04 and put down some specific
numbers that people could follow
6302.32 in order to ensure proper
hydration during training,
6304.95 you can look up the
Galpin equation elsewhere.
6307.33 You can just Google it or
look elsewhere and find it.
6310.72 And Dr. Galpin has also been
very thoughtful and generous,
6315.29 and I think very accurate in offering
6317.85 a kind of a general organizational logic
6320.64 for how to think about the goals
6322.9 of a particular training session,
6325.32 and thereby to decide whether or not
6327.82 you're going to do ballistic,
or static stretching,
6329.73 and so on and so forth.
6331.09 So, we can refer to this
general approach as Galpinian.
6335.843 Galpinian, is that right?
6337.53 Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic.
6341.6 Thus far, we've been
talking about stretching
6343.27 for sake of increasing limb
flexibility and range of motion,
6346.54 but there are other reasons perhaps
6349.55 to embark on a stretching protocol
6352.15 that include both our ability to relax
6355.78 and access deep relaxation quickly,
6358.16 as well as even to reduce inflammation
6361.71 and perhaps even combat
certain forms of cancer.
6364.65 And if that sounds really far-fetched,
6366.9 I want to emphasize that the study
6368.78 I'm about to share with you in a moment
6370.49 was actually carried out
by one of the directors
6373.25 of a division of the National
Institutes of Health.
6377.45 And this was the work of Helene Langevin,
6381.14 who's a medical doctor, has
done really important work
6385.32 on the mechanisms underlying
things like acupuncture
6390.01 and has approached all that
6391.29 from a very mechanistic viewpoint.
6394.02 Right, so not looking just at
the effects of acupuncture,
6396.46 but really trying to understand
what sorts of cytokines,
6399.45 inflammatory molecules,
and pathways are activated?
6403.04 What sorts of neural
mechanisms get engaged
6406.03 by things like acupuncture
6408.26 that impinges on the fascial
tissues and so forth?
6412.2 And Dr. Langevin is currently
6413.69 Director of the National Institutes
6415.42 of Complementary Health and Medicine
6419.36 at the National Institutes of Health.
6420.7 So, this is a major division
supported by tax dollars
6423.73 that support systematic
mechanistic exploration
6427.19 of things like respiration,
meditation, yoga, acupuncture.
6431.43 So, this is serious science
applied to protocols
6434.38 and approaches that have been
used for some period of time,
6436.13 but really aimed at trying to understand
6437.64 what would the best protocols
be to evolve new protocols?
6441.7 So, there's a really interesting study
6443.83 done in animal models,
6445.31 but I think it's a powerful enough result
6447.51 that I think we all should
pay attention to it.
6449.66 The title of this paper,
6450.75 and, again, the last author
is Dr. Langevin herself,
6453.76 is Stretching Reduces Tumor Growth
6456.47 in a Mouse Breast Cancer Model.
6458.63 And yes, you can get mice to stretch,
6460.62 it turns out that if you gently
lift up mice by their tail
6464.07 and they'll hold onto their cage,
6465.05 there's a way in which you
can mechanically stretch them
6467.46 in a way that doesn't harm them.
6468.9 First, I should mention
that Dr. Langevin and others
6471.29 have shown that just a brief
whole body stretch of that sort
6474.96 induces an increase in activation
of the parasympathetic arm
6480.22 of the autonomic nervous system,
6481.94 again, not arm, limb arm,
6483.51 but the aspect of the
autonomic nervous system
6485.88 that creates a whole body,
6488.17 whole nervous system shift
toward more relaxation.
6491.87 So, yes, indeed stretching
6494.63 induces relaxation at a systemic level,
6498.06 not just at a local level.
6499.41 And I think that's important,
6501.13 probably not surprising to those of you
6502.68 that use stretching regularly,
6504.3 but yes, it does indeed relax us.
6506.37 Yes, you can do this in mice
and see that in mice as well.
6509.62 Here's what they did
for this current study,
6511.98 or I should say this was
a study published in 2018
6515.71 in Scientific Reports.
6518.79 They write, "Recent studies have shown
6520.9 that gentle daily stretching
for 10 minutes can reduce
6523.14 local connective tissue
inflammation and fibrosis."
6525.41 Now, that's local tissue
inflammation and fibrosis
6529.74 as well we now know as
systemic inflammation
6533.81 and can induce relaxation systemically.
6537.77 In this case, they focused
on mice, not humans.
6540.88 And mice were randomized to a stretch
6542.68 versus no stretch condition
6544.25 and were treated for 10 minutes
once a day for four weeks.
6548.45 So, it's 10 minutes of this
passive whole body stretching
6552.6 a day for four weeks.
6554.72 What's remarkable, I mean,
6556.19 just I have to say is just striking
6558.39 is that tumor volume in these mice,
6560.47 they were able to induce
tumors in these mice
6562.13 and the tumor volume at the
end point was 52% smaller
6566.02 in the stretch group compared
to the no stretch group.
6569.32 This is a highly significant effect,
6571.61 and they point out in the
absence of any other treatment.
6574.96 And they explored whether or
not cytotoxic immune responses
6577.74 were activated and a
number of other features.
6580.53 They weren't able to get too deeply
6581.76 into the underlying mechanisms,
6583.93 but this is pretty remarkable.
6585.58 Even three weeks into stretching protocol,
6588.01 this daily stretching
protocol for these mice
6589.83 tumor volume was reduced, I
mean, by it's almost halved,
6594.09 this is pretty incredible.
6595.66 So, they have these
measures of tumor volume
6598.77 and the only difference
in the way these animals
6601.37 were treated and handled
6603.01 was the introduction
of this daily stretch.
6606.26 I find this result to
be, of course, limited
6609.73 in to the extent that it's
done in an animal model,
6612.19 not in humans, we have to point it out,
6614.14 but as they point out in their discussion,
6616.157 "Our results demonstrate a 52% reduction
6618.33 in mammary tumor growth over one month
6620.45 in mice undergoing stretching
for 10 minutes a day
6622.6 without any other form of therapy."
6624.7 Do they think that stretching itself
6627.04 is changing the tumor size?
6628.54 No, in fact they raise the
possibility that stretching
6631.87 because of its impact on the fascia
6633.74 might even create micro environments
6635.43 that are more permissive for tumor growth
6637.77 in certain instances,
6638.87 so they're careful to emphasize
6641.28 what I also believe to be the case,
6642.92 which is that it's unlikely
that the stretching itself
6645.05 was directly acting to reduce tumor size,
6647.61 but rather that there's this possible link
6650.36 between inflammation and
immune exhaustion mechanisms
6653.62 that if you can periodically
relax a nervous system,
6658.07 here through stretching,
6659.32 that it can affect certain pathways
6662.33 related to the immune system
6663.45 that would allow the immune
system to combat tumor growth
6666.57 to a significant degree.
6667.84 So, again, even though
this is a study in mice,
6670.1 it argues that relaxation
induced by stretching
6672.9 can have a powerful influence
on mammary tumor growth.
6675.56 Again, a huge effect carried out
6678.15 by one of the premier labs and individuals
6682.81 who do this sort of work and
think about this sort of thing.
6685.09 And, of course, I want to point out
6686.1 it wasn't just Dr. Langevin
that did this study,
6688.15 there are a number of
co-authors on the study
6689.68 we will provide a link to the co-authors,
6692.17 excuse me, we will provide
a link to the study
6694.33 so that you can peruse it
in more detail if you like.
6697.16 Now, as a related and
somewhat final point,
6700.49 I'd like to return to
this idea and this place,
6703.55 this real estate within our brain
6705.53 that we call the insular
cortex, the insula.
6708.02 As you recall, way back at
the beginning of this episode,
6711.19 we were talking about
the von Economo neurons,
6713.05 that Constantin von Economo
6714.75 the Austrian scientist discovered.
6718.15 And the fact that we are able to make
6721.32 and perform interpretations of
our internal landscape pain,
6725.58 our dedication to a practice,
6728.02 for instance, whether
or not we are in pain
6730.87 because it's a practice that
we are doing intentionally
6734.14 and want to improve ourselves,
6735.57 or whether or not it's
pain that's arriving
6737.44 through some externally
imposed demands or situations.
6740.92 Well, the insula is handling all that.
6743.44 And fortunately, there's a wonderful paper
6746.16 that was published,
6747.28 it was a few years ago now in
the journal Cerebral Cortex,
6750.14 which is a fine journal.
6751.42 This is the year 2014
6753.19 entitled Insular Cortex Mediates
Increased Pain Tolerance
6756.02 in Yoga Practitioners.
6757.41 I'll tell you why I like this study.
6759.25 I'm personally not a practitioner of yoga,
6761.15 I've taken a few yoga
classes over the years,
6762.97 I've done some of the hot yoga classes.
6765.91 Those rooms can get really,
really warm, I confess,
6769.526 and I've done the kind of
standard yoga every now and again.
6771.87 It's not something that
I've kept up regularly.
6775.21 This study explored the effects
6778.85 on brain structure volume
in yoga practitioners.
6783.73 And for those of you out there
that are aficionados in yoga,
6786.62 they pulled subjects from
having backgrounds in the...
6791.43 Here, I'm probably going to mispronounce
6792.75 these different things, and forgive me,
6794.48 the Vinysasa yogas, the Ashtanga yogas,
6797.118 the Iyengar yogas, the Sivananda yogas.
6799.35 Okay, so some people were
new to these practices,
6801.63 some were experienced.
6803.8 That the important take aways
6805.62 were that they took
these yoga practitioners
6808.2 and they didn't explore
their brain structure
6810.29 in the context of yoga itself,
6811.6 they looked at things like pain tolerance.
6814.48 So, they used thermal stimulation,
6816.5 basically they put people into conditions
6817.98 where they gave them very
hot or very cold stimuli
6820.37 and compared those yoga practitioners
6823.16 of varying levels of yoga experience
6824.98 to those that had no experience with yoga,
6827.29 so-called controls.
6828.42 And they found some
really interesting things,
6830.47 there are a lot of data in this paper,
6832.81 but here's something
I'd like to highlight.
6835.79 The pain tolerance of yoga practitioners
6839.26 was double or more to that
of non-yoga practitioners,
6844.27 even for those that weren't
doing this so-called hot yoga.
6846.67 Right, they also found that pain tolerance
6849.53 was significantly greater,
6850.6 both for heat pain and for cold pain.
6853.33 They also found significant
increases in insula,
6858.83 again, the insula, this brain region,
6860.74 gray matter volume.
6861.93 Typically, when we talk about gray matter,
6863.44 we're talking about the
so-called cell bodies,
6865.4 the location in neurons
where the genome is housed
6869.97 and where the kind of all the
housekeeping stuff is there.
6873.08 And then white matter volume
tends to be the axons,
6876.04 the wires because they're
ensheathed with this stuff
6878.27 that appears white in MRIs,
6880.27 and indeed is white under the microscope,
6882.04 and indeed is white, it's
actually lipid, which is myelin.
6884.74 So, increased gray matter
volume of the insula
6888.3 is a significant finding
6890.47 because what it suggests is
that people that are doing yoga
6893.61 have an increased volume
of these areas of the brain
6896.183 that are associated with
interoceptive awareness
6899.12 and for being able to
make judgements about pain
6902.1 and why one is experiencing pain,
6903.96 not just to lean away from pain,
6905.29 but to utilize or leverage
or even overcome pain.
6908.7 So, there are many studies of
yoga and meditation out there,
6912.99 few that have as much
mechanistic detail as this one.
6915.97 And in fact, there's a beautiful figure,
6918.43 Figure 3 in this paper
6919.93 that shows that the gray matter volume
6921.74 of this particular brain region
6923.6 scales in a almost linear way
6926.56 with the duration of yoga practice
6928.35 that somebody has been taking on in years.
6930.02 So, people that had, well,
hey had a few subjects
6932.36 that have up to 15 or 16
years of yoga practice
6935.37 had much larger left
insula gray matter volume,
6939.29 bigger brain areas associated
with these abilities.
6942.71 And I find this interesting
6944.23 because there are a lot
of activities out there
6946.91 that don't create these kind
of changes in brain volume,
6950.6 especially within the insula.
6952.08 So, it appears that it's
not just the performance
6954.42 of the yogic movements,
6955.81 but the overcoming or the kind of pushing
6957.88 into the end ranges of motion
6959.89 and to push through
discomfort to some extent,
6963.47 of course, we want people doing
that in a healthy, safe way,
6966.77 but that allows yoga practitioners
6968.7 to build up the structure and function
6972.39 of these brain areas that
allow them to cope with pain
6974.96 better than other individuals,
6976.74 and to cope with other kinds
of interoceptive challenges,
6980.41 if you will, not just pain but cold,
6983.236 not just pain but discomfort
6985.3 of being in a particular
position to do that.
6988.0 And again, we wouldn't want
people placing themselves
6990.3 into a compromised position
literally that would harm them,
6993.93 especially given that earlier we heard
6996.4 that Microstretching of
the kind of non-painful
6998.85 sort low-intensity sort is
actually going to be more effective
7001.24 for increasing end range of motion.
7003.01 But this study really
emphasizes the extent to which
7006.72 practitioners of yoga
don't just learn movements,
7010.01 they learn how to control
their nervous system in ways
7013.02 that really reshapes their
relationship to pain,
7017.01 to flexibility, and to the kinds of things
7019.94 that the neuromuscular
system was designed to do.
7023.23 And as a final point,
7024.96 there's a beautiful graph in this paper,
7027.39 beautiful I think because it explores
7028.98 some of the more subjective
dimensions of yoga
7033.16 and insula function,
7035.07 which is a here I'll read
it out in the nerdy form
7038.59 and then I'll explain what it means,
7039.887 "This is a frequency histogram
7041.6 of categories of mental
strategies used by yogis
7044.86 versus controls during the
cold pain tolerance task."
7047.77 What they're describing here and showing
7050.19 is quantitatively how
people are conceptualizing
7055.47 cold pain in order to get through it.
7057.87 And the different categories
are, for instance,
7060.43 distraction, right?
7061.69 Some people just choose to
distract themselves from pain
7064.55 or to attempt to, other
people will try to ignore it,
7066.91 it's a lot like distraction,
7068.22 but nonetheless, to engage
in a negative emotion,
7073.14 sort of like, "[growls]
like I'm going to dig,
7074.72 I'm going to be in resistance to this."
7077.94 Control subjects tended
to use those approaches,
7080.78 whereas practitioners
of yoga tended to use
7084.06 other sorts of subjective
approaches like positive imagery
7087.58 to some extent,
7089.15 the ability to relax
despite the extreme cold,
7093.54 the ability to quote-unquote accept
7095.98 like, "This is just happening,"
despite the extreme cold,
7098.83 to observe, to third person themselves.
7101.29 And the greatest effect,
of course, was to breathe,
7104.99 to focus on their respiration
7107.15 as a way to deal with this
challenge, this cold challenge.
7111.42 Now, all of that are subjective data,
7114.3 but I want to remind you that
the practitioners of yoga
7118.51 are not just using entirely
different mental strategies,
7121.37 but they are far more
effective at dealing with pain,
7125.0 their pain tolerance is much higher
7127.89 as evidenced by the other data
7129.43 in the previous graphs in the paper.
7131.39 So, while this podcast episode
7133.61 is most certainly not about yoga per se,
7136.0 it's about flexibility and stretching,
7138.63 flexibility and stretching are elements
7140.28 within yogic practices.
7142.39 And, of course, yogic practices
7143.72 involve breathing and mental work,
7146.19 and a lot of other things
balance, et cetera.
7148.44 It's a vast landscape
as as many of you know.
7151.26 But I think that if ever
there was a manuscript
7154.44 that pointed to the utility
of something like yoga
7157.83 for sake of tapping into a
particular set of brain circuits
7161.98 and mechanisms that could wick out
7164.24 into multiple dimensions of life,
7166.52 so day-to-day life, stress,
7169.48 challenges in dealing with all
sorts of external stressors,
7172.52 career-related,
family-related, relationally,
7175.99 et cetera, et cetera, excuse me,
7178.43 but as well for increasing range of motion
7181.87 for increasing flexibility.
7183.37 So, if ever there was a practice
that one could embark on
7186.76 that would not only increase flexibility
7188.737 and limb range of motion,
7189.98 but would also allow one to cultivate
7192.32 some improved mental functioning
7194.33 as it relates to pain tolerance
7195.83 and other features of stress management
7198.19 that no doubt wick out
into other areas of life,
7201.18 appears that yoga is a
quite useful practice.
7204.36 And so, for those of
you that are interested
7206.1 in increasing limb range of motion
7207.61 and you're already a
practitioner of yoga, great.
7209.8 I can imagine that someday
there'll be another study
7212.5 like this one and you'll be in that 10
7215.01 or 15-16 year practitioner graph.
7218.56 You'll be that dot way out
on the far end of the graph
7221.82 that shows that your
insula is that much bigger
7223.76 than the rest of ours,
7225.05 and therefore your internal
awareness, and pain thresholds,
7228.01 and stress management
will be that much better,
7230.17 but of course, yoga isn't the only way
7232.92 to increase limb range of
motion and flexibility.
7236.95 Up until now, we've described
7238.07 a number of different ways to do that
7239.69 and we've arrived at some
general themes and protocols.
7242.2 Again, those themes and
protocols will be distilled
7245.01 into some specific and precise list
7247.94 in our Neural Network Newsletter,
7249.41 but we can revisit a couple of them now
7251.39 just in summary and synthesis.
7254.24 Static stretching appears
to be at least among
7256.74 the more useful forms of stretching.
7258.44 So, low or zero momentum stretching
7261.24 typically at end range of motion.
7263.83 I love this concept of Microstretching,
7267.11 even though it's just a couple of studies
7268.87 that have addressed whether
or not high-intensity
7271.15 or low-intensity static stretch
holds are more beneficial.
7274.3 The idea and indeed the
data that low-intensity,
7278.19 so 30-40% of what would
one would consider painful
7283.41 appears to be more effective
than 80% of that threshold.
7287.4 I find that incredibly interesting.
7288.78 And then, there's this idea of frequency,
7290.98 it really does appear that getting
7293.72 at least five minutes per
week total of stretching
7296.97 for a given muscle group
is important for creating
7299.45 meaningful, lasting changes
in limb range of motion.
7302.77 And that is best achieved
by five day a week,
7306.59 or six day a week, or even
seven day a week protocols,
7309.32 but those can be very short protocols
7311.41 limited to, say, three sets of 30,
7314.27 maybe in 45 or 60 seconds of static hold.
7317.54 Although, 30 seconds seems
to be a key threshold there
7321.53 that can get you maximum benefit.
7323.75 There is no need to do
full 60-second holds
7325.76 unless you're doing fewer
total sessions per week.
7328.43 And, of course, to always warm-up
7330.58 or to arrive at the
stretching session warm.
7333.02 And then, of course, there are
the other forms of stretching
7335.28 that we touched upon a
bit, things like PNF.
7338.3 And we talked about why PNF works,
7340.32 things like the spindle and
the Golgi tendon organ reflexes
7343.67 that are built into all of us
7345.0 that we arrive in this world with.
7346.75 And of course, the other
forms of stretching
7348.41 that are known to be
effective and important,
7350.97 such as dynamic and ballistic stretching.
7354.18 Again, stretching protocols that involve
7356.46 a lot of momentum in order
to improve range of motion
7359.97 for performance of
particular types of work
7362.88 that one is about to embark on.
7364.75 Typically, that would be physical work,
7366.61 but a whole interesting
and unexplored landscape
7370.4 is the extent to which
changing limb range of motion
7373.77 and different types of body movement
7375.21 actually shape our cognitive abilities,
7377.63 and that will be the
topic of a future episode
7379.94 of this podcast.

7421.84 Not so much on today's episode,
7423.31 but in many episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast
7425.9 we talk about supplements.
7427.27 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
7429.49 many people deriv
tremendous benefit from them
7431.71 for things like improving
the transition time
7434.23 and depth of sleep,
7435.62 or for improving focus, or
for a variety of other things
7438.86 including things like anxiety management.
7440.86 For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast
7442.47 has decided to partner
with Momentous Supplements.
7445.53 First of all, Momentous Supplements
7446.74 are of the very highest quality,
7448.68 they're used at various
professional sports teams
7450.97 and they have contracts
7452.3 with various government organizations
7453.87 exploring the role of
particular supplements
7455.69 in human performance.
7457.4 Second of all, they ship internationally
7459.42 because we know a number of you
7460.66 are outside the country
of the United States,
7463.24 we hope that will be useful to you.
7465.26 As well, we wanted to
have a single location
7468.1 where people could go to access
7470.44 the most often discussed supplements
7473.08 here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
7474.9 So, while the full catalog
of those supplements
7477.03 isn't quite available yet,
many of them are available,
7480.69 you can find them by going to
livemomentous.com/huberman.
7484.24 Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman
7486.8 to find supplements for sleep,
for recovery from exercise,
7489.79 for focus, and many other features
7491.59 that impact mental health,
physical health, and performance.
7494.64 If you're not already
following Huberman Lab
7496.34 on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.
7499.17 At both places, I describe
science and science-related tools
7502.99 that relate to some of the themes
7504.53 covered here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
7506.13 But oftentimes I'll do posts
that include information
7508.72 and tools not detailed here
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
7512.06 We also have a newsletter,
7513.16 I've mentioned this a few
times during today's episode,
7515.55 it is the Neural Network Newsletter.
7517.74 You can access that newsletter
completely zero of cost
7520.99 by going to hubermanlab.com,
7522.51 go to the menu and sign
up for our newsletter.
7524.31 You supply your email,
7525.77 we do not share your
email with anybody else,
7527.8 we have a very clear privacy
policy that you can find there.
7530.87 If you want to see examples
of previous newsletters,
7533.75 you can find them there
without having to sign up.
7536.31 Again, that Neural Network Newsletter
7537.84 comes out about once a month
7539.43 and we use it to distill
out essential protocols
7542.79 from the podcast,
7543.67 to synthesize information
from the podcast.
7545.99 We do believe many
people find them useful,
7547.76 so sign up for the
Neural Network Newsletter
7549.79 if you're interested.
7550.82 So, thank you once again
for joining me today
7552.88 for a discussion about the neural,
7555.2 and neuromuscular, and connective tissue,
7557.77 and skeletal aspects of
flexibility and stretching.
7561.64 And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.
