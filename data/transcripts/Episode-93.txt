0.36 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.41 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.93 for everyday life.
9.81 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology
12.61 and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.
15.7 This podcast is separate from
my teaching and research roles
18.26 at Stanford.
19.3 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
21.6 to bring zero cost to consumer information
23.72 about science and science related tools
26.01 to the general public.
27.79 In keeping with that theme,
29.06 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
32.27 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
35.155 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
37.87 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
40.53 to help you better understand your body
42.23 and help you reach your health goals.
44.63 I've been getting my blood
work done for many years now,
47.71 and that's where the simple reason
49.14 that only through quality blood work,
52.01 and now through the advent of DNA test
54.35 can one really get a clear picture
56.17 of what's going on with their health.
58.12 Things like metabolic
factors and hormones,
61.06 all the various triglycerides.
62.91 These are things that can only be measured
64.62 from a quality blood test.
66.21 And now with DNA tests,
67.55 you can get an additional window
69.26 into your current health status
70.9 and the trajectory of your health.
72.89 What's really wonderful
about InsideTracker
75.1 is that you don't just get numbers back
77.19 about the specific levels
of various hormones
79.64 and metabolic factors,
80.92 you also get a lot of information about
82.59 what you could or should do in
order to adjust those numbers
85.707 to put you on the course to better health.
88.54 So for instance, it will
give recommendations
90.631 about particular foods to eat or avoid,
93.55 particular exercise regimens
95.348 that you might want to adopt
97.02 and the frequency of those regimens
98.61 in order to move those markers
in the correct direction.
102.624 InsideTracker has also added a new feature
105.54 that makes tracking your progress
107.91 and analyzing your data even easier.
110.28 For those of you that use
a Garmin fitness tracker
112.67 such as the Garmin watch,
114.19 that's now compatible with their platform.
116.27 So you can couple your
data from your Garmin
118.07 with your blood and DNA for
even more personalization
120.63 and insights on your health.
121.98 However, if you don't
have a Garmin device,
123.99 there's still a lot that you
can get from InsideTracker
126.75 and their tests.
127.86 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
129.38 you can visit
www.insidetracker.com/huberman.
132.48 And if you do that, you'll get 25% off
134.93 any of InsideTracker's plans.
136.69 Use the code Huberman at checkout,
138.62 that's www.insidetracker.com/huberman
141.35 to get 25% off any of
InsideTracker's plans
144.41 and use the code Huberman at checkout.
146.93 Today's podcast is also brought to us
148.78 by ExpressVPN.
150.82 ExpressVPN is a virtual private network
153.17 that keeps your data secure and private.
155.73 It does that by routing
your internet activity
157.93 through their servers and encrypting it,
159.82 so that no one can see or sell your data.
162.73 I'm familiar with the effects
of not securing my data
165.34 well enough.
166.173 A few years back I had
my bank accounts hacked.
169.09 I don't know exactly how it
happened, but it happened.
172.15 And it was a terrible amount of work
174.47 to have that reversed and secured.
176.444 The great thing about ExpressVPN
is I don't even notice
179.64 that it's running.
180.473 I have it on my computer,
181.33 I turn it on anytime I work at home
183.33 or when traveling or in
a cafe airport anywhere,
186.77 and it runs in the background,
188.01 it doesn't change anything
about the interface
189.83 with my computer or the wifi.
191.88 It just secures my data and
it secures any information
195.67 about what I happen to be
searching for, et cetera.
198.26 I don't feel like I have
anything particular to hide
200.34 except my bank account passwords
and things of that sort.
203.43 But with ExpressVPN, it basically
makes everything secure,
206.48 you can't be tracked and no one can access
208.629 or steal your data, which is terrific.
210.85 So again, I use it when I'm
traveling and when I'm at home.
214.86 If you want to start protecting
your internet activity
217.02 using ExpressVPN, you can go
to www.expressvpn.com/huberman
221.698 and you'll get an extra three months free
224.61 on a one-year package.
225.81 That's www.expressvpn.com/huberman
to get three months free
230.91 on any of their one-year packages.
233.31 Today's podcast is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.
236.73 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,
239.05 mineral, probiotic drink,
241.09 that gives you a total foundation
of vitamins and minerals
244.25 and probiotics to support
your health and wellbeing.
247.11 I've been using Athletic
Greens since 2012.
250.35 And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.
253.03 I started using Athletic Greens
254.76 and I still use Athletic
Greens once or twice a day
257.72 because it's the simplest
and most straightforward way
260.56 to get my basis of
important vitamins, minerals
264.29 and probiotic taken care off.
266.28 All of those things combined
to support various aspects
269.31 of my health,
270.75 such as brain health, such as gut health.
273.05 For instance, there's a
tremendous amount of evidence now
275.49 showing that probiotics support gut health
277.81 and that the gut brain access
is important for things like
280.69 focus and cognition, as
well as for immune function
284.2 and various aspects of physical
health, like metabolism.
286.94 The list sort of goes on and on.
289.18 With Athletic Greens,
290.17 it has all these vitamins and minerals
292.2 and various other things
that are good for me,
294.56 and I actually really
liked the way it tastes.
296.47 So the way I use it is once a day,
298.84 sometimes twice a day,
299.76 I'll mix it up with water,
300.79 I add a little bit of lemon or lime juice.
302.91 I think it tastes great without
the lemon or lime juice.
304.91 But when I add that, it's
truly delicious to me.
307.63 And I'll drink that
first thing in the day,
310.44 mid-morning sometimes instead
312.06 and sometimes again in
the later afternoon.
314.27 I'm able to drink Athletic
Greens late in the day
316.43 and not have it keep me awake.
318.65 If you want to try Athletic Greens,
320.36 you can go to
www.athleticgreens.com/huberman,
323.26 and if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.
325.94 They'll give you five free travel packs,
327.84 which make mixing up Athletic Greens
329.58 while you're on the road,
really simple and easy.
332.01 And they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3+K2.
335.77 Vitamin D3, as many of you know,
337.98 you can get from the sun,
339.32 but many people even if
they're already getting
341.34 a lot of sun exposure,
342.73 still have vitamin D3
levels that are too low.
346.13 And vitamin D3 is very important
347.9 for a huge number of
cardiovascular, immune,
350.77 metabolic and other aspects of health.
353.18 So once again, if you go to
www.athleticgreens.com/huberman,
356.41 you'll get the five travel packs
358.21 and a year supply of vitamin D3+K2.
361.74 Today is the third episode
in our series of episodes
364.62 about physical and
athletic skill performance
368.09 and skill learning in general.
370.12 And today we're going to talk
about the science of tools
373.97 for fat loss.
375.57 And fat loss is something
377.03 that interests a large number of people.
379.62 Many people want to lose fat,
381.5 many people are athletes
who need to lose fat.
385.29 And in general, we know that
having body fat percentages
388.89 that are too high is unhealthy for us.
391.6 And most people struggle to lose fat.
394.54 Most people struggled to
lose weight generally,
396.61 but most people especially
struggled to lose body fat
400.06 or what we call adipose tissue.
402.46 Now, this is a huge topic on the internet.
404.87 There's a lot of controversy.
406.87 Today, we're going to
talk about some things
409.27 related to fat loss,
410.54 and that are powerful for fat loss
412.79 that I'm guessing most of you
have never heard about before.
417.203 You may have heard about a few of them,
418.88 but I'm guessing you haven't
heard about all of them.
421.24 This episode is going to be
rich with science-based tools
425.015 that are gleaned from a variety of aspects
427.78 of the literature,
428.613 including the use of cold,
430.78 including brown fat,
432.48 including something called beige fat.
434.51 We're going to talk about
something called NEAT.
436.58 We're going to talk about all
sorts of aspects of fat loss
439.77 that are governed by your nervous system.
442.44 And this is I think an important gap
444.72 that's missing in the
discussion about fat loss.
447.267 You can hear a lot of
information out there
449.99 about the role of things like insulin
452.46 and various diets like ketogenic diets
454.56 or vegan diets or Mediterranean diets.
457.42 And there's some great stuff out there,
459.14 and there's some really
terrible information out there,
461.145 and there's a lot of controversy.
462.93 We did a number of episodes talking
464.93 about the role of hormones on metabolism
468.14 and the role of food
on mood and wellbeing.
472.62 So if you're interested in those topics,
474.31 please check them out.
475.62 I will touch a little
bit on hormones today.
478.29 Things like insulin and
leptin, just a little bit.
482.24 But today's episode is mainly
going to be focused on,
485.28 how the nervous system, neurons,
487.79 and some of the cells
they collaborate with,
490.06 like glioma and macrophages,
492.29 how those encourage or can
encourage accelerated fat loss.
497.12 Because it turns out they can.
498.64 Remember your nervous system
which includes your brain
500.93 and your spinal cord
and all the connections
503.54 that they make with
the organs of the body,
506.48 governs everything.
507.86 It's the on switch and the
off switch for immune system.
511.83 It's the on switch and the off switch.
513.57 It turns out also for fat burning.
515.68 And so the nervous system
and the role of the brain
518.87 and other neurons has
been vastly overlooked
522.36 in the discussion about losing fat.
524.86 Now, I would be remiss
526.47 and I'd probably come under
a pretty considerable attack,
528.77 if I didn't just acknowledge upfront
531.11 a core truth of metabolic science
534.97 and also of neuroscience, frankly,
537.16 which is that calories
in versus calories out,
540.48 meaning how many calories you ingest,
542.78 versus how many calories you burn
544.73 is the fundamental and
most important formula
547.6 in this business of fat loss
549.182 and weight management in general.
551.941 There's simply no way around the fact
554.26 that if you ingest far more
calories than you burn,
558.47 you're likely to gain weight.
560.89 And a good portion of that weight
562.4 is likely to be adipose tissue fat.
566.12 It's also true that if
you ingest fewer calories
568.65 than you burn,
569.5 that you will lose weight,
570.46 and that a significant portion
571.77 of that will come from body fat.
573.69 What portion?
574.53 Depends on a number of factors.
576.07 But that simple formula is important.
579.21 On a previous episode, I
mentioned the complications
582.11 with the statements of
a calorie is a calorie.
585.15 And indeed there is
evidence from for instance
588.04 Robert Lustig, who's a
pediatric endocrinologist
591.31 at UC San Francisco has talked
593.68 about how highly processed
foods change the way
596.06 that we utilize food,
597.513 and can lead to higher
incidences of obesity
602.13 and other metabolic syndromes
that go against the idea
606.2 that a calorie is a calorie and that's it.
608.15 So a calorie is a calorie
as a unit of energy,
611.97 and we need to accept and
acknowledge this calories in,
616.85 meaning calories ingested
versus calories burned formula.
620.2 But the calories burn portion
is strongly influenced
624.88 by a number of things that you can control
627.84 that can greatly accelerate
629.98 or increase the amount of adipose tissue
632.88 or the proportion of adipose tissue
634.81 that you burn in response
to exercise and food.
637.86 So your hormones are important.
641.54 Your thermogenic milieu,
644.36 meaning how warm or how cold your body is?
647.6 How cold you make it,
648.5 how warm you make it?
649.333 But also your level of metabolism.
651.21 Your levels of thyroid hormone
653.2 and something that's
hardly ever discussed,
656.92 but is well supported by
the scientific literature,
660.33 how much innervation?
662.05 Meaning how much connectivity there is,
664.23 between your nervous system and fat.
666.83 Today, we're going to talk about the fact
669.34 that your body fat of various kinds,
672.18 and there are several kinds of body fat
674.5 are actually innervated by neurons.
676.73 Neurons connect to your body fat
678.53 and can change the probability
680.73 that that body fat will be burned or not.
683.26 So your nervous system
is the master controller
685.41 of this process,
686.84 and it plays a strong
role in the calories out,
690.23 the calories burned component.
692.22 So as usual, we're going to
discuss a little bit of science.
695.84 I promise I won't go
too deep into lipolysis
699.07 and all sorts of things
related to fat oxidation.
701.429 We're going to break down that process
703.74 into two important steps.
705.73 And if you can understand
those two important steps
708.41 then the rest of the tools
will be very straightforward
711.48 to understand and manage.
713.52 And I do believe that
today you will walk away
717.24 with many new tools that
you could incorporate
719.86 into any kind of fat loss regimen
722.2 that will greatly accelerate that process,
724.56 because it's grounded in
quality peer-reviewed science.
728.54 Throughout the episode,
729.49 I'm going to talk about
some behavioral tools.
731.98 In fact, I'll mostly talk
about behavioral tools.
734.43 I will also talk about
compound, supplements.
737.5 Many of you are into supplements.
739.44 Some of you aren't, and that's fine.
741.22 For those of you that
are into supplements,
743.21 an important issue in a
discussion about supplements
746.36 for fat loss or otherwise
is going to be the quality
749.68 of those supplements and the accuracy
751.46 about what's in those
supplement bottles and tablets,
754.34 et cetera.
755.64 I usually mention this at
the end of the podcast,
757.62 but this podcast we've partnered
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.
761.9 Because Thorne we believe
has the highest levels
764.38 of stringency in terms of
the quality of the compounds
767.68 in their supplements and the
amounts of those compounds.
770.35 If you want to see the supplements I take,
772.07 you can go to www.thorne.com/u/huberman.
776.44 You can see the supplements that I take,
778.18 that will also allow you to get 20% off
780.09 any of those supplements,
781.24 or 20% off any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes.
785.3 Thorne has partnered with the Mayo Clinic
787.62 and all the major sports teams.
788.996 So there's a very strong
basis for their stringency.
793.08 Again, you don't need to use supplements.
795.26 I'm certainly not encouraging
anyone to use supplements
797.8 if that's not your thing,
799.22 but if you're going to use supplements,
800.56 make sure that your supplement source
801.97 is one a very high quality.
804.17 With that said, I want to get started
805.9 and talk about the
various tools for fat loss
808.87 and how neuroscience,
neurons control fat loss.
813.59 Before I do that,
814.54 I want to set the context correctly
817.27 and extract some of the key takeaways
819.66 from previous episodes,
821.34 because if your foundation of health
824.15 and your foundation of hormones
825.8 and your foundation of
metabolism isn't right,
828.52 it's going to be very hard to get the most
830.83 out of any kind of exercise
or fat loss protocol.
834.96 In previous episodes, I
talked all about the science
837.64 and the details going
into particular protocols.
840.31 We don't have time to do that now,
842.6 and I want to get to the new material.
844.27 However, there are a couple bins,
846.01 a couple items that you should make sure
848.12 you're getting correctly.
849.56 And if you're not perfect about
these, don't worry about it,
851.89 most people are not perfect about them,
853.49 I'm certainly not perfect about them.
855.4 But we should all be
striving to get quality
858.79 and sufficient sleep.
860.3 I did four full episodes on sleep
862.24 and how to get better at sleeping
863.98 through things like light
exposure, temperature,
866.87 timing your sleep correctly
for your so-called chronotype,
869.75 if you're a night owl or a morning person.
872.22 That's the first four
or I think five episodes
875.16 of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
876.79 Get your sleep right,
877.9 get your light exposure right,
879.7 avoid bright light in your eyes
881.49 at times you wanted to be asleep,
883.49 and get bright light in your eyes
885.31 at times you want to be awake.
886.97 So get your sleep right.
888.6 The other thing is essential fatty acids.
890.96 I talked about this in
the food and mood episode,
894.7 but I also talked about it
during the hormones episodes.
898.68 We need fatty acids.
900.16 They are vital to so many
aspects of our health.
902.95 You don't have to get
them from supplements.
904.71 You can, if you want to,
905.61 but you need to get them from your food.
907.41 They are essential.
908.66 There's a reason there's an
E the essential part there.
911.97 Of the fatty acids,
912.803 there are multiple kinds,
914.5 but for the antidepressant effects
917.17 where the levels of fatty acids
that will promote good mood
921.26 and also healthy metabolism
923.13 and we'll start to shift the
needle in the right direction
925.58 on bloodborne cardiovascular factors.
928.93 The key thing is to get the levels of EPA
931.31 that you ingest above
1000 milligrams per day.
935.65 So that doesn't mean just
taking a thousand milligrams
937.97 or more of say fish oil or krill oil
940.64 or whatever your preferred source is.
942.57 It means getting above a
thousand milligrams of EPA
946.19 which may require that you
ingest more essential fatty acids
949.53 than just a thousand milligrams per day.
952.216 That of course can be
done through food sources,
955.7 things like fatty fish,
957.04 or if you're not into eating fish,
959.48 you've quality meats that
are grass raised can do that.
961.74 There are other sources
of essential fatty acids,
964.28 of course also from plant sources.
965.75 So look, those up online.
967.06 It's really easy to find.
968.35 But the research and the literature shows
970.39 that you want to get above
a thousand milligrams
973.19 of EPA per day,
974.85 because that's when you can
best support your metabolism
978.39 and position yourself for good fat loss.
981.86 As well for people who
have cravings issues,
985.07 they crave sweets all the time,
986.44 I talked about this in
the gut-brain episode
989.02 and hormones and food.
990.3 That you have neurons in
your gut that are craving,
992.27 they're seeking essential fatty acids
994.35 and they're craving and seeking
amino acids from your food.
998.4 Now, these are not supplements
that they crave per se,
1001.2 they're craving those things
1002.43 because that's what your body
needs and your brain needs.
1005.13 But those same neurons
will respond to sugars.
1007.33 And so many people who are craving sugar
1009.89 can satisfy that sugar
craving by giving the neurons
1013.51 so to speak what they actually want,
1015.73 which are amino acids and
essential fatty acids.
1019.28 That includes EPA, but
also things like glutamine
1021.7 and amino acid that can
really reduce sugar cravings
1024.74 if you take a teaspoon of that,
1026.14 or even a tablespoon of
that a few times a day.
1029.31 You have to ease into that a little bit,
1030.61 because some people can get
a little bit of GI distress
1032.76 from too much glutamine.
1034.16 But glutamine has also been
shown to improve symptoms
1037.5 of leaky gut.
1038.49 It's a powerful amino acid.
1040.33 And yes, you can also get it from food.
1042.24 Things like cottage cheese are
high in glutamine, et cetera.
1045.14 And then finally you can't
really position yourself
1048.88 to have a strong metabolism
if your iodine levels
1052.56 aren't correct,
1053.393 and your thyroid levels aren't correct.
1055.41 You can overdo iodine.
1056.79 So you don't want to do that.
1058.31 A lot of table salt
has iodine added to it,
1061.92 but some people need to add iodine,
1064.72 by ingesting things like kelp, et cetera..
1066.67 But one of the best ways to
support the thyroid system
1068.827 and metabolism in general,
1070.34 is to make sure you're
getting enough selenium.
1072.24 Sometimes called selenium each day.
1074.84 Simple way to do that is to ingest
1076.92 the highest concentration of selenium food
1079.73 that I'm aware of, which is Brazil nuts,
1081.63 one or two or three of those per day.
1083.58 You'll have more than enough selenium
1086.03 to meet the thyroid needs.
1088.46 You don't want your
selenium to be too high,
1089.94 you don't want a diet
too high in anything.
1091.96 So again, sleep, sufficient EPAs,
1094.61 glutamine if you have
issues with leaky gut
1097.36 or sugar cravings can really help.
1100.05 Get your gut microbiome, right?
1101.98 I may have missed saying that,
1103.16 but get your gut microbiome right.
1105.13 That does not necessarily mean
1106.52 you need to ingest probiotics.
1108.53 You can, if you want to,
1110.08 but you can also just
simply ingest a serving
1112.85 or two of fermented foods per day,
1114.85 that can greatly assess.
1116.1 So things like sauerkraut, kimchi,
1117.65 every culture has a different source
1120.55 or sources of fermented foods,
1122.45 those can really help the gut microbiome,
1125.43 and then make sure that
your thyroid hormone
1127.59 is supported through the ingestion
1129.87 of sufficient iodine not too much
1132.0 and sufficient selenium, not too much.
1134.42 Okay?
1135.253 Sleep, EPA, glutamine, fermented foods,
1138.03 iodine and selenium.
1139.08 That sets the basis for how things
1142.65 like exercise, cold and
some of the compounds
1145.4 and other things that we're
going to talk about today
1147.83 that are I'm guessing going
to be truly new to many of you
1151.58 that can really increase the
burn factor in the equation
1156.04 of calories in versus calories burned.
1159.01 Okay?
1159.87 So on the one hand we have
this reality of calories in,
1162.75 versus calories burned.
1164.99 However, I would also be
remiss if I didn't mention
1168.07 an incredible study that
was done by my colleague,
1170.53 Alia Crum at Stanford.
1172.65 She's a faculty member,
1174.12 professor in the psychology department.
1176.77 Looking at how belief affects,
1178.84 just thinking can impact
the effects of things
1183.17 like exercise on weight loss.
1185.5 These are just incredible results.
1187.63 What they did was they took subjects
1190.42 who were hotel service people
that would clean the hotels
1194.07 and come in and change
the linens and so forth.
1197.39 Divide them into two groups.
1199.26 One group, they were told moving around
1203.35 and doing your duties for your job,
1207.03 meet the standards for US
guidelines for activity
1210.31 and movement, et cetera.
1211.84 And a basic lecture about how movement
1214.42 is good for you, et cetera.
1215.93 But mostly just that
their daily activities
1218.8 met the standards for the US.
1222.62 The other group, however, was
given a bunch of information
1225.91 about how movement and their daily routine
1229.647 was very good for cardiovascular health,
1232.67 it could be good for
weight loss, et cetera.
1234.9 And then they tracked these subjects
1237.53 over a period of many weeks.
1239.81 The take home message from this study
1241.32 was that simply being told
that movement is good for you
1246.06 can lead to weight loss, et cetera.
1247.65 Led to significantly more body fat loss,
1251.78 waist-to-hip ratio
changes in the direction
1254.29 that most people would want.
1255.8 But essentially a slimming
down, if you will.
1258.63 And all sorts of other positive effects
1261.62 on things like cardiovascular health.
1263.39 Simply by the knowledge
that movement and exercise
1267.35 can help various health markers.
1269.8 So this is remarkable and it speaks
1271.64 to the power of the nervous system
1273.117 and the power of belief in
governing aspects of our body
1277.107 and our physiology that
one would otherwise think
1280.41 we're outside our conscious control.
1283.21 Now, of course, any of you
that think scientifically
1286.63 which I imagine if you watch this podcast
1288.69 or listen to this podcast
is all of you by now
1291.82 probably thinking,
1292.653 well, maybe they just moved around more,
1294.15 or maybe they stood up and sat down more,
1298.36 maybe they did something
else that was different.
1300.72 And indeed there's a strong possibility
1302.72 that they did things differently
than the other group,
1305.68 but the mere knowledge that
exercise is good for you,
1310.76 that movement is good for you,
1311.94 shifted their behavior
and their physiology
1314.69 in the direction of enhanced weight loss,
1317.73 fat loss, et cetera.
1319.05 So how we think about a
given set of activities
1322.91 affects how we perform those activities.
1324.81 And how we think about and
perform those activities
1328.25 has a real effect on our physiology.
1330.48 So somewhere between
the hard and fast rule
1332.96 that governs fat loss and weight loss,
1335.4 which is if you ingest more
calories than you burn,
1338.5 you'll either maintain or gain weight.
1340.04 Typically, you'll gain weight,
1341.22 although not always.
1342.7 If you ingest about as
many calories as you burn,
1345.957 you'll maintain weight, typically.
1349.16 And if you ingest fewer
calories than you burn,
1351.21 typically you'll lose weight.
1352.27 That's the kind of rule of fat loss.
1354.68 And yet we also have these
belief effects which show,
1358.01 and this has been
replicated again and again,
1360.11 that how we think about a process,
1362.11 whether or not we think it's beneficial
1363.63 can change our physiology in ways
1365.96 that can be beneficial to us.
1368.07 Somewhere in between those two extremes
1370.92 of hardcore metabolic science
1374.12 and belief of why a bunch of protocols
1379.64 that are grounded in quality
peer-reviewed science
1381.97 and in physiology that you can leverage
1384.76 to increase the rates of fat loss.
1386.57 And so that's what we're
going to talk about today.
1388.92 I love this topic and it's not
1390.83 that I'm so obsessed with fat loss,
1393.15 but rather the first the project
I ever worked on in science
1396.7 was thermogenesis and fat loss.
1399.16 I joined a laboratory as an undergraduate,
1402.18 and the guy I worked for
loved to explore new compounds
1405.98 and how they impacted thermogenesis.
1408.84 And so we looked at how
things like MDMA/Ecstasy,
1413.59 how antipsychotics, antidepressants,
1417.18 various weight loss drugs
that were on the market.
1419.73 How those impacted body temperature
1422.27 and fat loss and metabolism?
1423.97 And we just had so much fun doing it.
1425.44 So if you detect a smile on my face,
1428.54 that's what that's about.
1430.0 And I also learned a lot,
1431.17 and I also came to really appreciate
1433.45 that this tissue of our bodies,
1436.43 adipose tissue and fat,
1437.84 we think of as just this unfortunate thing
1440.27 that's like we're told
it's a core energy source
1443.34 if we ever entered a famine
and that's all true, et cetera.
1446.227 You come to realize that
the cells in our body,
1448.88 they are there as fuel for
the furnace of our body,
1454.02 which is our metabolism.
1455.901 And there's a third player.
1457.85 And that's where it
really gets interesting.
1459.24 That the nervous system,
neurons has the opportunity
1462.79 to turn up the intensity of that furnace.
1465.8 It has the opportunity to
increase the amount of heat
1469.062 that we produce and therefore
the amount of energy
1472.53 that we burn.
1473.55 And I was also really intrigued
by something which is that,
1476.6 growing up, I think we all know people
1478.45 who can eat a tone and never
seem to gain any body fat.
1482.82 Or people who seem to eat very little
1484.66 and seem to gain body fat very easily.
1486.38 And I was always intrigued by that.
1487.367 And it turns out there are a
number of different factors
1490.15 that relate to that.
1491.52 But the nervous system is the one
1493.46 that we can really control.
1495.32 Both through behaviors and what we eat,
1496.91 but also in terms of this thing
that we call thermogenesis.
1500.29 There was one particular
story I want to relate to,
1502.42 that does not suggest any protocol.
1504.84 In fact, I'm going to discourage you
1506.47 from following this protocol.
1509.06 Please do not try the compound
that I'm about to describe.
1513.33 One of the favorite things
that we like to do in that lab
1516.29 was to find rare compounds and test them.
1520.25 And at the time I was
reading about thermogenesis
1523.91 and I learned about a compound
1525.32 that was actually discovered
in the armory factories
1528.2 of World War II.
1529.91 And it was discovered
because women in particular
1533.89 who were working in these factories
1536.08 would take a brush and
dip it in a compound
1539.94 or a paint rather,
1541.09 and they would then paint
the numbers with a stencil
1544.14 onto things like bombs and
ammunition of various kinds.
1548.83 And they were losing weight like crazy.
1552.55 It turns out that occasionally
they'd lick the brush,
1554.46 and then they would go back
just to get a sharper point
1557.12 on the brush,
1557.953 and then they would paint
onto these various bullets
1562.366 and missiles and so forth.
1563.49 Bombs and so forth.
1565.04 And they started shedding
all their body fat.
1567.34 And many of them losed, excuse
me, lost a lot of weight,
1570.91 a significant portion of their weight
1572.57 without changing anything
else that they were doing,
1574.43 what they were eating, et cetera.
1575.78 It turned out that that compound
1577.41 is something called Dinitrophenol, DNP.
1581.21 And over the years Dinatrophenol,
DNP has gained popularity
1587.88 in some niche cultures,
1589.07 mainly bodybuilders, athletes
even in the modeling industry.
1593.19 It is a absolutely terrible
compound for anyone to use,
1597.03 because it's highly fatal
if your body temperature
1601.11 goes too high.
1602.14 Hyperthermia will kill you.
1603.5 And indeed many people have
died using Dinatrophenol
1607.21 as a weight loss drug or attempting
1609.68 to use it as a weight loss drug.
1611.41 But Dinitophenol really
illustrates a principle
1614.84 which is that your
metabolism includes things
1618.54 like thyroid hormone and
growth hormone, et cetera.
1621.24 But your body temperature
1623.29 and the way you utilize energy
1626.8 is controlled by your nervous system.
1629.85 And the way Dinatrophenol works
is by changing the neurons
1634.55 and the way that the
neurons that connect to fat
1638.49 change the way fat burns up.
1641.19 So we are not going to suggest,
1643.41 I am not suggesting that
you use Dinatrophenol.
1647.788 However, there are other things
1649.58 that you can do that can
change the relationship
1652.81 between these neurons
and the fat of your body
1656.08 in ways that can powerfully
accelerate fat loss.
1660.607 And I don't know why we don't
hear about these things more,
1662.9 but probably because most of what you see
1665.24 out there on the internet focuses
1666.75 more on what you could eat and should eat
1668.88 or shouldn't eat.
1670.08 It concentrates on exercise regimens
1672.44 which we will also talk about.
1674.35 But the burn factor,
1677.23 your thermogenic
environment is one of the,
1681.53 if not the most important factors
1683.89 in this business of fat loss.
1686.02 And since I'm a neuroscientist
1687.45 that's what we're going to talk about.
1689.15 So let's talk about fat utilization.
1691.27 Let's talk about how fat
is converted into energy
1695.06 which is sometimes also
called fat burning.
1698.955 What I'd like you to know
1700.83 is that this is a two-part process.
1703.32 Okay?
1704.153 In reality, there are
many biochemical steps.
1707.25 And if you log onto the internet,
1709.77 or you open up a textbook
and you want to learn about
1713.7 fat utilization,
1714.84 you're going to see a lot of chemistry.
1717.37 And I'm happy to go deep into
that chemistry if you like.
1720.01 But I think most of you
are probably interested
1722.27 in what are the leverage points?
1724.52 Where can you exert control
over this process in ways
1727.54 that benefit you?
1728.38 So I'm going to focus mainly on those.
1730.58 Okay?
1731.413 This is not to upset the aficionados
1734.35 and I will put in some
nomenclature, but here we go.
1738.78 There's two parts to this process.
1740.53 One, is fat mobilization.
1743.68 And the second is fat
oxidation or utilization.
1748.42 Okay?
1749.253 So the first thing that
has to happen for body fat
1752.64 to get burned up or used and reduced
1756.41 is that it has to get mobilized.
1759.0 And that's a process called lipolysis,
1761.4 but I actually don't care if
you know the name lipolysis,
1764.35 you just have to move that
fat out of the position
1769.53 that it's in.
1770.37 You have to get it out of the fat cells.
1772.39 All right?
1773.223 Fat cells can be visceral
around our visceral organs
1776.16 or they can be subcutaneous
under our skin.
1777.93 Most people are thinking
about subcutaneous fat
1781.18 when they think about fat.
1782.95 So here's the deal.
1785.35 And if you want more detail,
1787.87 great, I'll touch on that in a bit.
1790.63 But basically stored fat has two parts
1794.31 that are relevant here.
1795.65 It's got the fatty acid part,
1797.28 and that's the part
that your body can use.
1799.54 And that's attached to
something called glycerol
1801.7 and they're linked by a backbone.
1803.55 So already, probably too much
chemistry for both of you.
1805.49 But what you want is you
want to break the backbone.
1807.82 So if you just can
remember to mobilize fat,
1809.727 you got to break the backbone
1811.23 between glycerol and these fatty acids.
1813.27 Okay?
1814.103 That's accomplished by
an enzyme called lipase,
1816.322 but you can forget all that if you want.
1817.96 Remember, we're just
trying to mobilize fat.
1820.23 So the first step is to
get those fatty acids
1823.21 moving around in the bloodstream
1825.21 to get them out of those fat cells.
1827.64 And then they can travel
and be used for energy.
1832.68 And that second part,
1833.98 remember first part is mobilization.
1835.74 The second part is oxidation.
1837.77 Is then those fatty acids,
1839.16 those are potential fuel.
1840.93 They're just potential fuel,
1842.09 but you haven't burned the fat yet,
1843.59 you've just moved it
out of your fat cells.
1846.04 They're going to go into cells
that can use them for energy.
1850.82 And once they are inside those cells,
1853.26 they're still not burned up.
1855.23 You need to oxidize them.
1856.55 Think oxidation is the burnup part.
1859.82 They need to be moved
into the mitochondria
1864.16 and then they can be converted
into ATP into energy.
1867.47 So just to really zoom
out again to make sure
1869.18 I don't lose anybody.
1870.02 You got to mobilize the fat,
1871.28 then you have to oxidize the fat.
1873.36 In other words, you have to mobilize it,
1874.67 then you actually have to
convert it into energy.
1877.15 If you just mobilize it,
1879.65 and you don't convert it into energy,
1881.36 you don't oxidize it,
1882.59 it can be returned to body fat.
1885.02 And many of the things that
the nervous system can do,
1888.53 is to increase the mobilization of fat,
1892.4 but also the oxidation of fat.
1895.22 Okay?
1896.053 So you have two opportunities
to burn more fat,
1899.07 and both of those
opportunities are governed
1901.52 by your nervous system.
1903.0 By neurons that literally
send little wires
1906.051 that we call axons into
fat and release chemicals
1910.32 that provide a stimulus
for more of that fat
1914.14 to be mobilized,
1915.62 and then later for more of
that fat to be burned up.
1919.3 Okay?
1920.133 So we could go really deep on this,
1922.42 but I'm not going to go
much deeper than that,
1924.17 because this isn't a biochemistry
1926.4 of fatty acid metabolism lecture.
1928.69 This is about how to burn fat
using your nervous system.
1931.5 But remember, there's a mobilization step,
1933.74 and then there's an oxidation step.
1935.61 I think anyone of you,
1937.41 all of you should be
able to internalize that.
1939.23 Mobilize then oxidize.
1941.72 Okay?
1942.553 Mobilize then oxidize.
1944.25 So what are these neurons
that connect a fat doing?
1947.14 What are they releasing exactly?
1949.08 How do they actually
increase fat mobilization?
1951.45 And how do they increase fat oxidation?
1953.95 Burning of fat.
1955.92 Well, there are a couple
of things that they release
1959.05 that encourage that process.
1960.71 And the main one that you need
to know about is epinephrine
1964.48 or adrenaline.
1966.13 The conversion of these
fatty acids into ATP
1969.47 in the mitochondria of cells
is favored by adrenaline.
1973.82 Okay?
1974.7 And adrenaline is
released from two sources.
1978.34 Adrenaline is released
from the adrenal glands,
1980.45 which set a top our
kidneys and our lower back.
1983.41 And it's also released
1985.56 from the so-called
sympathetic nervous system.
1987.62 Although that name is a bit of a misnomer,
1989.82 because it has nothing
to do with sympathy,
1991.94 has to do with stimulating alertness
1994.36 and promoting action of the body.
1997.8 There's a big mistake in the literature
2002.33 that is finally being
corrected among those who know.
2005.899 The mistake in the literature
is that the adrenal glands
2009.41 and the release of adrenaline
is what stimulates fat loss
2013.38 and fat oxidation.
2015.36 In fact, it was thought for a long time
2017.95 that adrenaline swimming
around in your body
2020.13 of when you're fasted,
2021.44 because fasting can increase adrenaline
2023.51 or when you're engaging
in intense exercise
2026.33 or when you're stressed is
going to promote fat oxidation.
2030.26 That's actually not the case.
2033.09 The adrenaline that
stimulates fat oxidation,
2036.4 the burning of fat is coming from neurons
2039.54 that actually connect to the fat,
2042.67 not hormones like adrenaline
that are swimming around
2045.82 in your system.
2046.653 It's a local process.
2048.43 And this is very important
because it means that,
2052.42 what you do, the specific
patterns of movements
2056.41 and the specific environment you create
2059.353 that can stimulate these
particular neurons to activate fat,
2066.12 meaning to release fat,
2068.56 to mobilize it and then to burn it,
2070.36 is going to be a powerful
lever that you can use
2073.21 in order to increase fat loss.
2075.19 So what have we said so far?
2076.33 We've said that you've got to
mobilize and you got to burn fat
2078.56 and that your nervous system
is in control of that process.
2082.87 It's not just about calorie deficit.
2086.71 Okay, so let's talk about how to activate
2089.05 the nervous system in
ways that it promotes
2091.09 more liberation, movement,
mobilization of fat
2094.16 and more oxidation of fat.
2096.66 So one of the most powerful
ways to stimulate epinephrin
2100.07 which is also called
adrenaline from these neurons
2102.75 that connect to fat and
to thereby stimulate
2106.24 more fat mobilization and
oxidation is through movement.
2110.98 But I'm not talking about exercise.
2113.65 The type of movement
that I'm referring to,
2115.5 is extremely subtle.
2117.84 And some of you may be familiar
with this type of movement,
2121.85 but I'm guessing you're
probably not familiar
2124.9 with what I'm about to tell you,
2126.59 which is that shiver or
shivering is a strong stimulus
2132.86 for the release of adrenaline
epinephrin into fat
2136.66 and the increase in fat
oxidation and mobilization.
2141.09 But shiver is not just induced by cold,
2144.83 and there are other
subtle forms of movement
2147.74 that can greatly increase
fat metabolism and fat loss.
2152.83 There was a group in England
during the 1960s and 70s
2156.53 that discovered a pathway by
which subtle forms of movement
2162.66 can greatly increase fat loss.
2166.05 This is the work of Rothwell and Stock.
2169.23 It's very famous in the
thermogenesis literature.
2172.2 And I learned about this early on,
2173.66 when I was an undergraduate and I asked,
2176.3 how did they come across this?
2177.49 And here's how the story goes.
2180.097 They were aware that some people overeat
2184.69 and yet don't put on weight.
2186.71 Other people overeat
even just a little bit
2189.24 and they seem to accumulate
extra adipose tissue.
2192.9 Now, this is long before
all the discussions
2194.95 about microbiome and
hormone factors, you know
2197.627 it was long before many
of the hormone factors
2200.28 besides insulin had even been discovered.
2202.781 What they did was they
examined people who overate
2206.36 and did not gain weight.
2208.71 And what they observed was
that those people engaged
2212.613 in lots of subtle movement
throughout the day.
2215.63 In other words, they were fidgeters.
2218.08 And that's what they call them.
2219.36 I'm not going to do the British
accent version of fidgeters.
2223.43 But Roth and Stock were British.
2226.71 What they found were people that overeat
2228.59 but don't gain weight as a consequence.
2232.26 And in fact, many people who
had low levels of body fat
2236.6 had a lot of resting tremor,
2240.04 not of the Parkinsonian type,
2241.53 but they would bounce their
knee while they were sitting,
2244.07 when they would talk,
2245.32 they would engage in
very angular movements,
2247.73 they were sort of electric.
2248.94 In fact, now in science,
2250.28 I was chuckling about
this as I was diving back
2252.44 into this literature,
2253.273 because the other day I
heard a wonderful lecture
2255.42 on a totally different topic
from a colleague of mine
2257.76 and we all adore him.
2259.16 He's over in Europe
2260.01 and he's this tremendously
successful scientist.
2262.31 So we like to poke fun at him.
2264.55 And every one of his movements
is incredibly electric
2267.3 and staccato.
2268.37 And he's rail thin and
he eats like a horse.
2271.11 And so it fits very
well into the discovery
2272.92 of Rothwell and Stock who discovered
2276.01 that fidgeters people
that bounce their knee,
2279.3 people that have a head bob
while they're listening,
2282.76 people that nod a lot,
2284.04 people that stand up and sit
down a lot throughout the day,
2286.85 and people that pace
burn anywhere from 800
2290.995 to 2,500 calories more
than the control group
2296.86 in the experiments that they looked at.
2298.43 And indeed, there's been a
modern look into all this,
2302.13 and these numbers check out
2303.93 that simply moving around a lot,
2306.49 even if those are subtle movements,
2308.84 greatly increases the amount
of energy that you burn.
2311.75 And people who overeat,
2312.91 the people who can have the
second or the third doughnut
2315.51 or doughnuts at all and
don't seem to put on weight
2317.7 to the same degree,
2319.15 they are people that move
around a lot even when seated.
2323.24 They're are people that
will often move their limbs
2326.96 very quickly as well.
2328.69 There even have been studies
that have explored other things
2332.32 that correlate with fidgeters.
2333.594 Fidgeters stand up very
quickly at the end of a lecture
2335.95 or they start to gather
their things very quickly,
2337.9 whereas non fidgeters don't.
2339.92 So dogs like my bulldog Costello,
definitely not a fidgeter.
2344.26 Every movement is incredibly
slow and deliberate.
2347.36 Sitting down as a process,
2348.9 if you ask him to sit down
and sort of a slow motion.
2351.99 You ask him to get up
2352.93 and he kind of looks at
you sighs and stands up.
2355.3 The fidgeter is the
opposite of that, right?
2357.28 You say, how are you doing?
2358.24 They go, great.
2359.35 So even sometimes their
speech will be accelerated
2362.08 although not always.
2363.1 But staccato movements,
fidgeting, et cetera.
2366.05 And in 2015, and again in 2017,
2369.563 there've been studies
that have explored this,
2372.44 using some modern metabolic tracking
2374.85 and indeed simply moving a lot,
2378.21 being a fidgeter, bouncing your knee,
2380.4 standing up and pacing several times
2383.01 or many times throughout the day
2385.43 led to considerable amounts
of fat loss and weight loss
2389.85 when people were ingesting
the same amount of food,
2392.86 if they overate, they
were able to compensate
2394.92 and burn off that food.
2396.68 And if they were trying to lose weight
2400.67 and they incorporated
this fidgeting protocol
2403.7 of deliberately trying to fidget more
2405.37 and move around during the day,
2407.05 pace, stand up more quickly,
2408.53 sit down more often,
2409.68 sit down and stand up more often rather.
2411.71 They found that they greatly
increased their weight loss
2414.3 anywhere from 20 to 30% increases.
2417.63 And in some cases, you know,
there always those few people
2420.06 who burned a lot more.
2421.52 It seems to work best in people
2424.23 who are already slightly overweight.
2427.03 So for people that are overweight,
2428.85 who are kind of averse to exercise,
2431.53 fidgeting might actually
be a good entry point.
2434.49 And 800 to 2,500 calories
is a considerable amount
2438.08 of calories when you
really think about it.
2440.18 Now, why am I telling you this?
2441.41 Well, there's clearly a
tool to export from this,
2444.36 which is that you can increase
the amount of calories burned
2447.59 without having to go on
additional long runs.
2450.63 I do hope that people
are exercising regularly
2452.59 because it's so important
for other aspects of brain
2454.94 and body health.
2456.12 But nonetheless, we are all time limited
2460.73 and we are not all so
ready to embrace exercise.
2464.96 I have a family member
who has been slowly coaxed
2468.81 into exercise,
2469.7 but if I were to tell her, for instance,
2471.24 you need to fidget more,
she'd probably go for it.
2473.44 So this is a powerful way
to increase the calories
2478.54 that are burned.
2479.65 Now, that's great.
2482.38 And you can think about the protocols.
2483.68 But I want to nest that protocol
2486.96 in what I said before,
2488.92 which is that, fat is
controlled by these neurons
2493.45 and the epinephrin they release.
2495.31 You might say, well, how could
these little micro movements
2498.34 lead to so much caloric burn?
2500.99 And that's where it
really gets interesting.
2502.94 Rothwell and Stock and
others that they worked with,
2505.41 subsequently found that these
little fidgety movements,
2509.23 the engagement of certain
aspects of our musculature
2512.08 that are nothing like exercise.
2513.88 It's not these large coordinated
or rhythmic body movements,
2517.34 but rather subtle little
bits of fidgety movement.
2521.47 And here I am doing a lot of
fidgety movement as an example,
2525.53 tapping the pen, this kind of thing.
2527.25 I was probably that kid
in class most of the time.
2529.345 And I was like, I try not
to do it to irritate people,
2530.977 but I was definitely a knee bouncer.
2533.56 I'm not particularly lean or not.
2535.71 But I was definitely...
2538.35 This is a common activity for me.
2540.3 People that do that sort of thing,
2541.88 it turns out that it's not
the kind of caloric burn
2545.32 that we normally think of,
2546.37 of like, oh, you'll
running, lifting weights,
2548.3 swimming, yoga, et cetera.
2550.61 Those subtle movements
of our core musculature,
2554.29 not just the core, but all our limbs
2556.11 and our musculature,
2557.52 those low level movements,
2559.92 they trigger epinephrin
release from these neurons,
2563.75 and they stimulate the
mobilization of fat.
2566.77 And then that fat is
oxidized at higher rates.
2569.96 And I find this fascinating.
2571.5 I wish more people knew about it,
2572.87 which is why I'm telling
you about it today.
2574.82 This has nothing to do with exercise
2576.86 in the traditional form,
2578.26 and yet 800 to 2,500 calories per day.
2581.27 That's a considerable
amount of fat oxidized.
2584.82 If you are in a calorie maintenance mode
2587.85 or if you're sub caloric,
2589.28 that's going to add to it
still additional fat loss.
2593.07 The data on this are tremendous.
2594.28 I'll link to a few studies.
2595.46 If you're really interested in learning
2596.96 about what's called neat.
2598.53 N-E-A-T which is non-exercise
activity thermogenesis.
2603.97 NEAT.
2605.0 So what's the protocol?
2606.49 Fidget.
2607.97 If you're really interested
in burning calories
2610.1 and you already exercise,
2612.05 you want to burn more
2612.89 or you don't have the
opportunity to exercise
2615.38 or you're averse to exercise
for whatever reason,
2618.62 fidgeting, movements, staccato movement,
2621.15 standing up, walking around, pacing,
2623.8 all the sort of nervous activities
2625.54 that were so critical of other people
2627.047 and sometimes in ourselves
2628.87 are actually mobilizing and oxidizing
2632.17 a lot of fat and a lot of energy.
2635.03 And while this probably won't compensate
2637.61 for chronic overeating,
2640.18 the caloric burn from
this is considerable,
2643.04 and very likely can offset a meal
2647.36 that had excessive calories
2648.95 or a kind of steady
state of eating too much.
2652.93 And it also starts to open
up all sorts of thoughts
2655.3 and discussion about when you travel,
2657.76 you tend to eat foods
that are kind of outside
2660.2 your normal ones.
2661.033 We tend to eat foods that
aren't so great for us,
2663.55 we also tend to be a
little bit more sedentary
2665.32 when we travel we're on
the plane, et cetera.
2667.73 But all of that aside,
2671.18 just the use of something
like low-level movement.
2674.81 And it's almost like a tremor,
2676.83 but also these select short,
small fidgety movements.
2679.57 I'm intentionally doing
a lot of these today.
2680.95 So you have examples that you can use
2684.25 to select from if you like.
2686.42 These can have a major effect on fat loss
2690.87 and it raises a second tool.
2694.17 If these low, meaning
these small movements
2697.7 that we engage in trigger
epinephrin adrenaline release
2700.77 from these neurons of the
sympathetic nervous system
2702.593 that innervate fat and increase
2705.21 fat mobilization and oxidation.
2708.21 Now, it should make sense why shivering
2712.36 is one of the strongest stimuli
2715.33 that one can incorporate
to stimulate fat loss.
2719.93 Now, shivering is almost
always associated with cold.
2723.08 We think shivering, we think cold,
2724.35 because when we get cold, we shiver.
2726.88 And there are two ways that
shivering can increase fat loss.
2730.96 And there are several ways
that you can use shivering,
2734.21 you can leverage shivering
2735.75 and you can leverage cold
to accelerate fat loss.
2738.62 But you have to do it correctly.
2740.76 And most of the people that are using cold
2744.26 and frankly suggesting cold
2746.21 as a means to increase metabolism fat loss
2749.46 are suggesting the exact wrong protocol.
2752.37 In fact, the one I'm going
to recommend is 180 degrees
2755.32 in the opposite direction
to the typical protocol
2757.93 that you'd hear about.
2758.763 So let's talk about how to use cold
2760.74 and how to leverage shiver as
a particularly strong stimulus
2765.33 to increase fat loss through
mobilization and oxidation
2769.39 of these fatty acids.
2771.02 So in recent years there's
been a growing interest
2773.32 in the use of cold for
various things like,
2776.52 improving stress tolerance,
2778.06 improving metabolism,
recovery from exercise.
2780.88 I've talked about a number of those things
2782.48 and the uses of cold on this podcast.
2784.88 In fact, did an episode on
how to supercharge performance
2790.32 through palmer cooling, cooling the palms
2793.63 in specific ways or the
bottoms of the feet.
2796.22 And if you're interested in that,
2797.88 and how to improve performance
in endurance and strength,
2800.58 you can check out that episode.
2802.33 But most people out there
are using cold exposure
2806.72 typically by taking cold showers
2809.97 or by getting into cold
water of some other kind,
2813.13 a lake or a river or a
cold bath or an ice bath.
2816.65 And they are doing that
probably with mixed goals,
2820.61 meaning they both would like
to increase their metabolism
2824.12 and burn fat, as well as
improve mental resilience.
2828.89 Since today, we're talking
about accelerating fat loss
2831.74 through the use of science-based tools.
2834.16 I want to emphasize a study
that was published in nature
2836.93 just a couple of years ago,
2839.18 showing exactly how cold
increases metabolism and fat loss.
2845.55 Okay?
2846.383 So we have several kinds of fat.
2848.69 Three kinds in fact.
2850.58 We have white fat, white adipose tissue,
2853.6 and we have brown fat
or brown adipose tissue.
2858.071 And there's a third kind
which is beige adipose tissue.
2862.91 White fat is the type
that we traditionally
2865.02 think of as fat, subcutaneous fat.
2868.67 And it is not particularly
rich in mitochondria.
2871.42 It is there as an energy storage site
2874.89 and we have to mobilize the fat out
2876.88 as we talked about before
and burn it up elsewhere.
2879.76 Brown fat largely exists
between our shoulder blades
2884.14 and on the back of our
neck, between the scapulae.
2887.84 And it's rich with mitochondria
2889.48 which is why it's called brown fat.
2891.92 And brown fat has a
particular biochemical cascade
2896.61 whereby it can take food energy,
2900.44 it can take food, basically,
2902.3 break it down and convert it
into energy within those cells.
2906.4 And there's some
additional steps involved,
2908.05 but unlike fatty acids from white fat
2910.86 which have to travel elsewhere
2912.19 get broken down in mitochondria
2914.34 and convert into ATP, et cetera.
2917.35 Used by the mitochondria rather.
2919.82 Brown fat is thermogenic.
2922.26 It can actually use energy directly.
2924.56 It skips a step, and I
don't want to get diverted
2926.89 by going into all the biochemistry of it.
2929.82 Beige fat is sort of in between.
2932.21 It's white fat that could be brown fat,
2935.97 because it has some mitochondria in it,
2938.23 but not as many as brown fat.
2940.31 Now, cold exposure does several things.
2943.14 Making ourselves cold
can allow us to build up
2947.41 mental resilience because
getting into cold of any kind,
2951.23 doesn't matter if it's a cryochamber,
2953.01 doesn't matter if it's a cold day
2954.42 and you forgot your sweater or your parka.
2956.7 It doesn't matter if it's an ice bath
2959.34 or you're lying down in the snow.
2962.19 Cold causes the release of
adrenaline from your adrenals.
2966.24 And it causes the release of epinephrin
2968.95 from these neurons that connect to fat.
2971.41 Now, the big effects of cold on metabolism
2977.2 and fat burning are going
to be through two routes.
2980.51 One, is that if you
expose yourself to cold,
2984.24 you have the opportunity to
trigger activation of brown fat
2989.07 as well as to convert more
beige fat into true brown fat.
2992.99 So you essentially create a
stronger or a hotter furnace.
2997.66 That's the way to think about brown fat.
2999.21 It's like a furnace.
3000.15 And so with this principle
3001.85 that we started with a calories
in versus calories burned.
3005.2 What you're doing is you're
increasing the amount
3007.56 of burning,
3008.393 you're increasing the burn of energy
3011.94 by increasing the intensity
of the heat inside you
3015.57 so to speak.
3016.403 Okay?
3017.236 I'm talking here kind of metaphorically.
3020.08 Now, how can you do that?
3021.91 Well, if you get into cold water
3025.37 or an ice bath or a cold day,
3027.82 and you try and remain
calm and resist shivering,
3032.67 you actually short circuit
3035.33 this mechanism for increasing
brown fat thermogenesis.
3039.02 The paper published in nature shows
3041.08 that it is shivering itself
3044.32 that causes the brown fat
to increase your burning,
3049.07 your burn rate and your metabolism.
3051.05 And it works like this,
3052.3 when you get into cold and you shiver,
3055.3 the shivering that low level
movement of the muscle,
3058.6 those small movements triggers
the release of a molecule
3061.58 called succinate.
3063.08 S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
3066.63 And succinate acts on the brown fat
3069.88 to increase brown fat thermogenesis
and fat burning overall.
3073.75 It actually increases body heat
3075.6 through this brown fat
thermogenesis pathway.
3078.81 And it also over time can
increase the amount of brown fat
3083.25 by converting beige fat
into true brown fat.
3087.52 Now, how much cold exposure and how often?
3090.53 That's the key.
3092.63 But before I give that
detail or set of details.
3097.1 Remember if you resist the shiver,
3099.84 you are not going to get the
increased metabolic effect,
3102.93 because you are not going to
get the succinate release.
3106.29 So if you want to get your body heat,
3110.05 your thermogenic level to go up,
3112.54 you need to shiver.
3114.0 So now we have the NEAT,
3115.36 the non-exercise activity thermogenesis.
3117.51 So low levels of activity
as I described before,
3119.9 which are done away from cold,
3121.75 maybe do them in cold as well.
3123.06 As well as shiver in response to cold.
3125.64 And so the shiver itself is valuable
3128.31 for triggering the release of succinate.
3129.61 In fact, succinate is being evolved now
3132.18 by various drug manufacturers
3133.599 as a potential treatment for obesity.
3135.76 Although it hasn't really hit the market
3137.5 in its final form yet.
3139.79 Succinate is powerful for
its effects on brown fat.
3144.09 So how many times a week do you need
3146.46 to expose yourself to cold?
3147.69 Will depend on how much
fat you're trying to lose,
3150.62 and how much you're trying
to increase your metabolism.
3153.94 There are studies that describe
positive effects on fat loss
3157.83 of exposing yourself to cold,
3159.39 either through cold
shower or through ice bath
3162.44 or other cold water.
3163.54 It doesn't have to
actually have ice in it,
3164.9 provided it's cold enough
for anytime, anywhere,
3168.96 excuse me, between one
and five times per week.
3172.19 But it turns out that
just one exposure per week
3174.43 can be valuable.
3175.88 The question then is how long to get
3178.87 into that cold environment?
3180.57 And how cold should that environment be?
3184.08 So first let's talk about how long
3185.93 to get into that cold environment?
3188.49 The answer here might be
a little bit different
3190.31 than you might imagine.
3192.33 Most of you might think,
3193.28 oh, well if one minute is
good, three minutes is better,
3196.04 and if three minutes is better
than 10 minutes is best.
3199.68 But remember the goal is
to get the shiver induced
3204.02 release of succinate,
3205.08 so that succinate can
trigger the brown fat.
3210.1 It turns out that if you
want to trigger the shiver,
3213.47 what you want to do is
to get into the cold
3216.47 and then get out of the cold
and typically not dry off,
3221.14 and then get back into the
cold and out of the cold,
3223.68 that will definitely
stimulate more shivering
3226.15 than just getting into the cold itself.
3228.41 So what I'm not referring to,
3229.67 is getting into the cold
environment like an ice bath
3231.94 and waiting until you shiver
and staying there shivering.
3235.35 Okay?
3236.183 You also don't want to get hypothermic.
3237.63 And I want to be clear.
3239.355 You want to get approval from your doctor
3241.08 before you do any of this.
3243.76 When you get into cold water,
3246.06 there are two factors that will dictate
3247.78 whether or not you shiver.
3249.22 Probably three,
3250.07 but let's just talk about the main two.
3251.47 One, is how cold it is.
3252.64 So how cold should it be?
3253.68 And look, if you get into
water, that's very, very cold.
3256.61 It can actually shock your heart.
3258.06 It can actually give you a heart attack
3259.48 if it's truly, truly ice cold,
3262.15 and you're not adapted to that.
3263.79 So proceed with caution, please.
3265.93 I'm not a physician and I don't
want to see anyone get hurt.
3271.841 Just cold enough to be uncomfortable
3273.88 is a good place to start.
3275.69 So for some of you that's
going to be 60 degrees,
3278.24 for some of you that's
going to be 55 degrees,
3280.24 for some of you it's going
to be high thirties, right?
3284.16 Depends on how cold adapted you are,
3285.78 and people vary in terms of how
well they tolerate the cold.
3289.35 So what you need to do
is find a temperature
3291.15 that you can get into one to five,
3294.13 probably one to three times a week.
3295.73 If you really want this
to accelerate fat loss.
3298.2 And you want to get in until
you just start to shiver,
3300.44 and then you want to
get out and not dry off,
3303.82 wait anywhere from one to three minutes
3307.26 and then get back into the cold.
3310.07 Now, you'll notice when
you get back into the cold,
3312.61 it'll almost seem soothing,
3314.57 it might actually not induce shiv...
3316.7 It might take away the
shiver that you had.
3319.49 So here's a potential
kind of sets reps protocol
3322.87 that you can play with.
3323.87 Find a temperature then
induce a shiver for you.
3325.84 That's going to vary depending
on your cold tolerance
3328.05 and how cold adapted you are.
3329.56 One to three,
3330.41 maybe five times a week,
3332.04 get in until you...
3333.98 Or get under the shower or whatever it is,
3335.81 until you start to shiver.
3337.0 Genuinely shiver.
3338.97 Then after about a minute or so, get out,
3342.4 spend one to three minutes
out, but don't dry off,
3344.85 get back in for anywhere
from one to three minutes,
3348.64 but try and access the shiver point again.
3351.49 And you might do three
repetitions of that.
3353.9 So it's three times in
and three times out total.
3356.93 Okay?
3357.79 That's a great starting place.
3360.71 And what you don't want to
do is build up your tolerance
3365.38 to cold so fast,
3367.28 that pretty soon you're
able to resist the shiver,
3369.42 because remember the shiver
3370.79 is the source of the succinate release
3372.41 that will trigger brown fat thermogenesis.
3374.98 So if you'd like to see
this protocol spelled out,
3377.29 you can access it zero cost at a website
3380.29 which is www.thecoldplunge.com.
3382.85 The Cold Plunge is a company
they make cold plunges,
3386.06 and they were kind enough to gift one
3387.71 to the Human Lab Podcast.
3389.72 But I want to emphasize that
these protocols are free of cost.
3392.75 The folks at the Cold Plunge
are not just interested
3395.36 in marketing their product,
3397.43 but one of their main
interests is encouraging people
3399.79 to engage in cold exposure
for particular end points
3403.05 and goals like fat loss,
resilience, et cetera.
3406.67 Resisting inflammation.
3408.84 But their main focus is
providing people protocols
3413.59 and encouraging people to use
cold exposure of various kinds
3416.35 not just through their products,
3417.56 but through cold rivers
and jumps in the ocean
3420.72 and things like cold showers,
3422.27 whatever is most convenient
3424.63 and accessible for various people.
3426.71 And so we needed a place
where we could house
3429.17 these protocols in a permanent way,
3431.61 and not just for this episode.
3433.64 But so what they've agreed to do is,
3435.23 to post the protocols there,
3436.5 they should be very easy
to find on their website.
3438.96 This particular protocol we're referring
3441.76 to as the fat loss optimization protocol
3446.74 for lack of a better name.
3448.24 And it's really grounded in how cold
3450.33 it can be used to induce shiver.
3452.4 And again, it doesn't really matter
3453.64 how you're accessing that cold,
3455.68 provided you access to the shiver,
3457.38 and you're moving from
the cold environment
3459.51 to a slightly warmer environment.
3461.51 So getting out of the cold shower
3463.02 or getting out of the ice bath, et cetera,
3465.46 or out of the cold plunge,
3466.68 and then back in.
3467.92 Because it turns out that the cooling
3469.78 and rewarming process of the
body is where shiver kicks in.
3474.48 And so that's distinctly different
3477.35 than just trying to get into the cold
3478.9 and stay in the cold
for as long as possible.
3481.42 And if you zoom out a little bit
3483.32 and think about some examples in life,
3486.19 you'll understand why
that must be the case.
3489.13 For instance, people who do
a lot of cold water swims,
3492.78 you have these polar bear clubs,
3494.14 I think they call themselves.
3495.23 They do these cold water swims.
3497.1 I would sometimes see these
people swimming back and forth
3499.19 to Alcatraz and stuff like
that, which it seems risky.
3502.45 and they tell me it's very stimulating
3504.85 for the mind and body.
3505.683 Great.
3506.516 Sometimes those people are very lean,
3508.6 oftentimes they're not,
3510.34 and they're getting a
lot of cold exposure.
3513.12 And one of the things that happens is,
3515.44 if you expose yourself
to cold over and over,
3517.62 you adapt,
3518.453 you become cold adapted.
3519.43 And when you do that,
3520.263 you no longer get the epinephrine,
3522.01 the adrenaline release from the cold
3524.3 and therefore you don't
get the succinate release
3526.84 and the shivering and the
brown fat thermogenic effect
3529.8 quite as intensely.
3531.33 So if you want to use
cold for other reasons,
3533.99 and certainly cold water swims can be fun.
3535.96 And there's, you know, long
as you can do them safely,
3539.01 they're great.
3539.843 I've gotten into cold water swimming
3540.95 for some period of time.
3542.61 You can use cold for
resilience, et cetera.
3544.5 But if you want to use
cold to increase fat loss,
3547.73 then getting this shiver
process going the cooling
3551.54 and rewarming which
accelerates the amount of,
3553.99 or increases the amount of shiver.
3555.6 That's going to be the way to go.
3557.88 One note about cold
and some of the factors
3559.96 that it releases.
3561.38 A few years back there
was a lot of excitement
3563.4 about this hormone called
irisin, I-R-I-S-I-N,
3567.36 which was associated with cold.
3569.65 And there was a lot of excitement
3571.13 about its potential role
in increasing metabolism
3574.5 so much so that people
were starting to explore
3577.34 this as a potential fat loss drug.
3579.08 To my knowledge that went nowhere.
3581.72 The science eventually
shifted over to succinate
3585.02 as the main factor in
cold induced thermogenesis
3589.05 through this brown fat pathway.
3590.73 But if anyone out there is aware
3592.24 of any positive effects of iricin
3594.0 or of any signs of irisin
that I'm overlooking here,
3597.9 or that I'm speaking about
incorrectly, please let me know.
3599.89 I'd be very curious to learn.
3602.29 Now, I want to just talk about
brown fat a little bit more,
3606.87 and talk about a period in your life
3609.194 in which you were rich with brown fat,
3612.32 you had a ton of brown fat,
3613.91 and that's when you were a baby.
3616.34 Babies can't shiver.
3619.28 These neurons that release
epinephrin into fat
3623.93 are not wired up and really aren't present
3627.83 at sufficient levels or
in sufficient numbers
3630.81 when you are a baby.
3632.32 And therefore you can't shiver as a baby,
3635.14 and you can't warm yourself
up in cold environments
3637.31 very well.
3638.87 To compensate for that,
3641.44 mother nature installed in all of us
3644.18 an excess of brown fat early in life
3647.28 that exists again in the upper back,
3649.337 and the middle of the back
and the back of the neck.
3653.25 Over time if we don't expose
ourselves to cold environments
3657.25 or do other things that make a shiver,
3660.24 we lose a lot of that brown fat,
3662.67 but what's interesting about brown fat
3664.25 is that there's some evidence
3665.26 that brown fat just like white fat
3669.08 can both increase in size,
3671.71 but that you can also add new cells.
3674.28 Now, there's a little bit controversial.
3675.67 People always say you can't
change the number of fat cells,
3677.95 you can just shrink them
or increase their size.
3681.19 Well, it turns out that
epinephrin released
3684.66 from these little nerve
endings in brown fat
3687.42 and succinate circulating in the body may
3690.75 and I want to underscore
may have the effect
3692.87 of increasing the amount
of brown fat cells
3695.39 probably by converting these
beige fat cells into brown fat.
3700.36 So that allows us to become
much as we were early in life,
3703.29 where we metabolized like crazy
3705.58 and we'd heat ourselves
up without shivering.
3708.66 Some people have taken the
cold thing to the extreme,
3711.7 putting ice packs on
the back of their neck
3713.69 throughout the day.
3715.12 Did a episode all about
testosterone and estrogen,
3717.82 and there's this, let's
just call it a very niche,
3722.15 I have to imagine very,
very niche culture of people
3724.81 who are wearing literally, I'm not joking.
3727.61 They are these cool pack
ice pack underpants.
3730.87 They go by a name that I'm
not going to repeat on here,
3732.76 but you can find them on Amazon.
3735.17 Those are people that are
using cold packs on the body
3737.698 and on the groin to
try and increase things
3739.96 like testosterone.
3742.395 But as well to try and
increase thermogenesis
3744.89 and trying to increase their metabolism.
3747.43 Just remember if you become cold adapted,
3750.31 you're not going to get
the fat burning effects
3752.19 to the same degree.
3753.33 So cold is a powerful tool for fat loss,
3756.13 but you don't want to adapt.
3757.59 This is reminiscent of a rule
3760.08 that you hear about in endurance exercise
3762.13 and in strength exercise as well,
3764.04 which is, that you want to use
the minimal effective stimulus
3767.81 to promote growth or progress.
3769.85 So growth of a muscle or
improvements in endurance.
3772.95 If you go 10% further
on a run or 10% faster,
3777.93 you will likely see an
improvement in performance
3780.51 provided your recovery the
next time you come back
3782.52 and do that same round of exercise.
3785.61 You'll be able to do more work
3786.93 or complete the work
more easily, et cetera.
3788.85 You've adapted.
3790.74 If you do 20% more distance
or 20% more weight,
3795.41 you won't necessarily see the same
3798.48 commiserate level of gain or improvement.
3801.3 And so likewise with cold,
3803.45 if you're quickly moving
from 30 seconds of exposure
3805.96 to 10 minutes of exposure,
3807.32 you're overlooking the opportunity
to get the most fat loss
3811.45 and increase in metabolism
by stepping it up
3814.59 in smaller increments.
3816.16 Okay?
3816.993 And this also speaks to the rationale
3819.38 for using cold exposure
to accelerate fat loss
3822.05 for certain periods,
3823.17 but then maybe not doing it year round.
3825.52 If fat loss is your goal,
3827.14 maybe use it for two,
three months at a time
3829.54 and then stop for two,
three months at a time,
3831.23 because it is such a potent stimulus
3832.84 provided you engage in the shiver.
3836.44 Next I'd like to move to exercise
and how particular timing
3840.69 and types of exercise can
vastly improve fat loss.
3845.15 Before I do that,
3845.983 I just want to mention a
really important reference
3848.78 for those of you that are
interested in learning more about
3851.27 how neurons connect to fat?
3853.82 This is certainly a paper
that you'd want to look at,
3856.31 if you're interested in diving
deep into the literature
3859.14 and reading all the various studies.
3861.13 It's a review.
3862.33 And the title of the review
is neural innervation
3864.77 of white adipose tissue and
the control of lipolysis.
3868.7 That's neural innervation
of white adipose tissue
3870.83 and the control of lipolysis.
3872.34 It was published in Frontiers
in Neuroendocrinology.
3875.68 You can find that free online.
3877.3 They have the full text available.
3879.11 The first author is
Bartness, B-A-R-T-N-E-S-S.
3883.17 It's a great review.
3884.68 And I've talked about a number of things
3886.22 that are mentioned in the review.
3887.77 Follow the references in that review
3889.7 and the reference trail as we say,
3891.56 if you're interested
in learning more about
3893.53 also how neurons control brown fat.
3896.61 And before I moved to exercise,
3898.47 I also just want to highlight something
3900.31 that comes up every few years
3902.01 and has largely been considered myth now,
3906.32 but that is actually more interesting
3909.08 than most people might think,
3910.84 which is this issue of spot reduction.
3913.61 You know, in the 80s and 90s,
3916.37 there were a lot of commercials,
3917.93 late night infomercials,
3920.45 where they would talk
about spot reduction.
3922.66 If you do sit ups, will
you lose abdominal fat?
3925.61 If you do hip raises or glute raises,
3927.223 will you lose gluten hip fat.
3929.6 And I think everybody
knows now believes that,
3933.38 and understands that fat metabolism
3936.39 is something that happens
systemically throughout the body.
3938.88 That some body fat is
quote unquote more stubborn
3941.21 than others.
3942.043 Everyone varies in where
they tend to store fat
3944.66 or lose fat last.
3946.284 Number of factors that influence that,
3948.46 and in particular hormone receptors.
3951.37 But now at least in the
scientific literature,
3957.16 spot reduction and the possibility of real
3960.45 true spot reduction reductions
in fat in a targeted way,
3964.2 a body part or body area targeted way
3966.93 is becoming more of a reality
and may be a reality soon,
3971.76 because exercise that
triggers the activation
3976.76 of these nerve fibers,
3978.34 these neurons that innervate fat.
3980.85 In theory, if you can increase
the amount of epinephrin
3985.24 released at those particular
fat pads as they're called,
3988.83 they're actually called fat pads
3990.41 in the scientific literature.
3992.35 In theory, you could increase mobilization
3995.81 from those particular body fat sites.
3999.35 Okay?
4000.183 So because the new view that
the modern understanding
4004.26 is that it's not adrenaline
released systemically
4006.98 kind of bathing all your fat tissue,
4009.87 but rather its neurons
releasing adrenaline
4012.57 epinephrin locally that in theory,
4016.01 exercise that stimulates
the release of epinephrin
4019.29 or exercise coupled
with things like shiver
4022.95 or low grade shaking movement,
4024.75 or the NEAT, the non-exercise
activity thermogenesis
4029.79 could in theory lead to local enhancement
4034.2 of mobilization of fat tissue.
4036.65 So I think that spot reduction
4038.03 actually will soon be
something that's possible
4041.24 using the appropriate technology.
4043.29 What does this mean for you now?
4044.86 What could you possibly do
with this information now?
4048.9 Well, I think it speaks to the fact
4053.24 that if one is going to engage in exercise
4056.98 that doing exercises that involve
4059.42 lots of different body parts and movements
4063.0 is likely to encourage the maintenance
4066.25 and or growth of these neurons
4068.95 that innervate fat throughout the body.
4071.02 What this means is changing
up the pattern of exercise,
4073.92 engaging in novel types of movements
4076.44 may actually be one
way that one can access
4079.07 these so-called stubborn body fat pads.
4082.01 Now, there's a little bit of speculation
4083.44 in the statement that I'm making,
4084.97 but if you think about it it makes sense.
4086.48 If you become very adapted
to a particular pattern
4089.05 of exercise,
4090.61 whether or not you're subcaloric or not,
4092.7 you're on maintenance calories are not,
4095.39 you are oxidizing some fat always,
4098.6 and you're utilizing the
neurons that innervate fat
4102.37 in a regular way.
4103.3 And pretty soon this innervation
is going to shut off,
4107.6 because there's no reason why
this neural innervation of fat
4111.66 should continue to release epinephrin
4113.65 unless you give it a
strong stimulus like cold
4115.9 or the fidgeting or in this case
4118.81 to do novel forms of exercise.
4121.24 And there's some anecdotal evidence
4124.33 and I don't even want to call it data,
4126.04 but anecdotal evidence
that people who have,
4128.67 quote on quote stubborn body fat,
4130.2 if they start to adopt
new patterns of exercise,
4132.81 they can start to access
those stubborn fat pads.
4136.13 And again, fat pads is the correct way
4137.96 to refer to these in the
scientific literature.
4140.81 So what we're focusing
on today is the fact
4144.26 that fat indeed will be
mobilized and oxidized
4148.19 in response to a deficit in calories.
4150.5 But that the way that neurons
control those fat pads
4153.697 and those body fat stores,
4155.235 affords you a lot more control
4157.84 than perhaps you ever previously thought.
4160.56 So let's talk about movement.
4162.72 And the more traditional
kinds of movement,
4164.41 aka exercise has been
shown to lead to increases
4167.68 in metabolism and fat
loss to greater degrees
4171.9 depending on whether or not for,
4173.3 instance you're fasted
when you do it or not,
4176.06 whether or not you do your cardio first
4177.73 or your resistance training first.
4179.81 And this is again in the literature
4182.21 for which there's a lot of controversy,
4183.94 but in digging through
all the studies on this,
4187.06 we're finally starting to
arrive at a consensus of,
4189.96 when is best to do exercise?
4191.69 And what types of exercise to
do if your goal is fat loss?
4195.96 The topic of exercise is a
kind of controversial one,
4199.5 not as controversial as nutrition and diet
4201.49 which we will talk about in a few minutes.
4203.78 But it's a particularly interesting one,
4206.88 because different types
of exercising gauge
4209.84 the musculature of the body
and the heart and the lungs
4212.06 in different ways,
4213.57 and can have vastly
different effects on things
4215.73 like hormones and metabolism
depending on whether
4218.29 or not it's of high intensity,
4219.89 moderate intensity or low intensity.
4222.34 So rather than think about weight training
4224.61 versus cardiovascular exercise,
4227.08 I think the most simple way,
4229.91 the most fluid way to have this
conversation about exercise
4233.78 and fat loss is in terms of
three general types of training.
4238.15 Whether or not it's done
with weights or body weight
4240.19 doesn't really matter.
4242.15 And those are high
intensity interval training.
4245.06 Something that's seems to have
gained a lot of popularity
4247.41 in recent years.
4248.31 So-called HITT, H-I-I-T.
4249.86 So high intensity interval training.
4252.26 Sprint interval training.
4254.04 So that's going to be very
high intensity or SIT,
4257.05 or moderate intensity
continuous training, M-I-C-T.
4261.29 So we've got HIIT, SIT and MICT, M-I-C-T.
4265.83 And we can get a little bit
more precise if you'd like.
4268.5 I'm not somebody who measures
my VO2 max or anything
4271.26 while I exercise.
4272.1 I generally know whether
or not I'm doing something
4274.67 I could continue for a very long time,
4276.3 or whether or not I'm doing something
4277.92 that I realize is going
to be of short duration
4281.61 high-intensity.
4282.443 But if you'd like to
map this to VO2 max SIT,
4287.6 this sprint interval training was defined
4290.04 as all out greater than 100% of VO2 max
4293.44 bursts of activity that
lasts eight to 30 seconds
4297.0 intersperse with less
intense recovery periods.
4299.16 So this would be sprinting downfield
4301.54 for eight to 30 seconds,
4303.23 then maybe walking back
for about a minute or two
4306.5 and then sprinting again
and then continuing.
4308.27 So that would be SIT.
4309.45 HIIT, H-I-I-T is defined as submaximal,
4313.31 so 80 to a hundred percent
of VO2 max bursts of activity
4317.06 that lasts 60 to 240 seconds
4320.32 intersperse with less
intense recovery periods.
4322.88 So on a standard 400 meter track,
4325.02 just to give this a
little bit of a visual,
4328.54 a four minute mile would be
fantastic for most people,
4331.25 although people run faster
than that of course.
4333.25 So that's four 60 seconds laps,
4335.35 but that's back to back to back.
4337.52 I think in my best shape or
maybe it was in my dreams,
4340.77 I don't recall which I
was able to do 60 seconds
4343.04 around the track,
4343.873 but of course I couldn't
get that on the second
4345.26 or third or fourth if I
did that was certainly
4349.76 in the fantasy land and not reality.
4352.17 But 60 seconds would
be about one revolution
4355.64 around the track,
4356.473 maybe 90 seconds, depending
on how fast a one is running.
4360.2 So 60 to 240 seconds.
4362.62 MICT okay.
4364.66 This moderate intensity
continuous training
4367.55 is steady state cardio
sometimes called Zone 2 cardio
4370.97 these days on the internet,
4372.63 which has performed continuously
for 20 to 60 minutes
4375.64 at moderate intensity
of 40 to 60% of VO2 max
4380.07 or if you prefer heart rate
55 to 70% of max heart rate.
4385.27 Okay?
4386.103 So we can think about high, medium
4388.0 and low intensity exercise.
4389.61 Although low intensity usually means
4392.37 that you could carry on a conversation,
4393.96 or maybe you have to gasp
every few steps or so,
4396.52 while trying to talk and run.
4397.96 That's I think going to
be the most useful way
4400.35 to have this conversation
that we're having now,
4403.15 because there's so many
different forms of exercise
4405.18 that people do and intensity is important.
4408.75 Let's ask the question
that I think many people
4411.27 are wondering about,
4413.49 which is, is it better?
4414.99 Meaning do you burn more fat
if you do your exercise fasted?
4418.5 And fasted in this respect
could be that you wake up
4422.06 in the morning,
4422.893 you've been fasting all night,
4424.02 you just hydrate and you exercise
4427.04 or sometimes people will ingest caffeine,
4429.74 there's controversy as to whether
or not that quote on quote
4431.76 breaks the fast.
4432.78 It has to do with whether
or not your caffeine adapted
4434.63 something for another episode.
4437.24 In any case that would be fasted.
4438.99 So probably not having eaten anything
4440.99 for anywhere from three to
24 hours or maybe even more.
4445.192 As you could also be
fasted in the afternoon.
4446.86 If you had lunch at noon and it's four
4448.85 or five or 6:00 p.m.
4450.1 Is it, will you burn more fat
4452.23 if you exercise without
an eating anything first,
4456.91 without ingesting any calories first?
4458.98 And people have tried to
really split hairs on this,
4461.06 every which way people say,
4462.05 well, you can fat fast,
4463.73 because fat and protein doesn't lead
4465.79 to as great increases in
insulin as other things,
4470.82 maybe you can have a few
almonds and then still train.
4473.02 And indeed insulin will
prevent fat oxidation.
4478.79 I want to be really clear.
4479.69 The burning part of fat in the cell,
4481.28 the movement of the fatty
acid and into mitochondria
4485.63 and the conversion ATP,
insulin inhibits that process.
4489.13 However, it's been shown
4492.5 that it least for short
periods of training,
4495.38 it doesn't really seem to
matter whether or not you eat
4498.05 before training or you don't,
4500.31 if your goal is fat oxidation.
4502.83 Now, I want to put an asterix near that,
4504.61 because there are some exceptions.
4506.01 But there were several studies done that,
4509.707 and the kind of the classic ones of these,
4512.58 I'll read out to you.
4514.21 What they basically did is they
gave people glucose, sugar,
4518.24 to increase their blood
sugar before training or not.
4521.93 And the kind of classic study
of this is Al Borg at all.
4525.92 So in 1976, so it goes way back,
4528.08 which is that glucose reduces
fat burning and exercise.
4531.42 And then some other studies
if you want to look these up,
4533.7 they're very easy to find on PubMed.
4535.16 You put in Horowitz 1999,
4538.775 [indistinct] is another
one where they have people
4541.95 drink milk with glucose in it.
4543.63 So sweet sugary milk
before exercise, et cetera.
4547.5 And you can find a number of examples
4549.96 where eating before exercise
reduces the amount of fat
4554.22 that's oxidized during the exercise.
4556.81 And you can also find a lot
of studies showing that,
4562.55 eating during exercise
or prior to exercise
4565.81 will not reduce the amount
of fat that is oxidized.
4568.52 However, the types of exercise
4570.57 whether I was medium
intensity or high intensity
4573.87 or low intensity is all over
the map for these studies.
4576.33 So it's very hard to
target an ideal protocol.
4579.71 And then if you look really
deep in the literature,
4582.56 you start to find meta analysis
4584.54 where people have actually
aggregated all the findings
4587.72 and some modern studies where it points
4590.05 to some very specific
and useful protocols.
4592.45 And so here's the rule
that or the protocol
4595.24 that I extracted from that literature.
4599.4 At a period of about 90 minutes
4602.65 of moderate intensity exercise,
4604.363 I want to be clear,
4606.22 at about or after 90 minutes
of moderate intensity exercise.
4611.22 There's a switchover point
4613.61 whereby if you ate before the exercise,
4617.07 you will reduce, excuse me,
4618.7 you will burn far less fat
from the 90 minute point onward
4624.32 than you would if you had
gone into the training fasted.
4627.82 So let me repeat that.
4629.25 If it's moderate intensity,
4630.73 so-called zone two cardio type exercise,
4634.3 at the 90 minute point,
4636.72 if you happen to have
eaten before the exercise
4639.37 within one to three hours
prior to the exercise,
4643.16 then you reduce the amount
of fat that you will burn
4646.5 from 90 minutes onward,
4649.04 whereas if you had fasted
prior to the exercise,
4652.06 you hadn't eaten anything
for three hours or more prior
4654.26 to the exercise.
4655.093 At the 90 minute point,
90 minutes of exercise
4658.44 you will start to burn
more fat than you would
4661.69 had you eaten.
4663.1 Now, 90 minutes of moderate
intensity exercises is a lot.
4667.68 So that's a pretty long run.
4669.74 Even if you're running
at a pretty slow pace
4671.84 like a 10 or 12 minute mile,
that's a lot of running,
4675.43 that's a lot of swimming.
4676.33 So that's a lot of walking,
4677.81 that's a lot of hiking.
4679.82 However, there are people who
are going out hiking all day
4682.07 or running all day or walking all day.
4683.75 And if you want to burn
more fat per unit time,
4687.04 you want to oxidize more fat
then you would do that fasted.
4690.4 Now, there are also studies
that pointed the fact
4694.75 that you don't have to wait to 90 minutes
4697.01 in order to get this
enhanced fat burning effect.
4701.25 The studies I was able to find
4703.6 and that looked to me like
quality peer-reviewed studies
4706.06 with no company bias or no
product bias of any kind.
4710.65 These are studies that were largely funded
4712.97 by the federal government
in the university context
4718.08 pointed the fact that if one
does high-intensity training,
4723.584 or even the very high
intensity forms of training
4726.24 like sprints or squats or deadlifts
4728.65 or any kind of activity
that can't be maintained
4731.37 for more than these, you know, eight
4733.36 or I would say up to 60 seconds.
4735.29 So a set of lifting
weights repeated, repeated,
4737.84 if that's done for
anywhere from 20 minutes,
4741.45 so weight training or power lifting
4743.82 or these kinds of things
or kettlebell swings
4746.07 or up to 60 minutes,
4748.66 we'll then the switchover point
4750.66 in which you can burn more fat,
4752.28 if you go into that fasted comes earlier.
4755.38 And this makes sense
because there's nothing holy
4757.89 about the 90 minute point
for a medium intensity
4761.58 Zone 2 cardio.
4763.17 That 90 minute point is the point
4765.72 in which the body shifts over
from mainly burning glycogen,
4771.06 basically, sugar that comes
from muscles or the liver
4774.49 and realizes this is going on for a while,
4777.62 I'm going to shift over
to a storage site fuel
4783.42 that is in reserve like body fat.
4786.49 This is going to happen for a while,
4787.77 so I'm going to start
tapping into body fat stores.
4789.61 Now, fat doesn't have
a little brain there.
4791.32 It is innervated by neurons,
but it doesn't have thoughts.
4793.54 And you don't actually control
this switch with your mind.
4796.13 This is something that
has to do with the milieu
4798.48 of various hormones.
4799.93 What has to happen is insulin
has to go down far enough.
4803.87 So if you ate before the exercise,
4805.74 you'd have an increase in insulin,
4807.33 if you ate carbohydrates
4808.35 you'd have a bigger increase
in insulin, fat and proteins
4811.2 indeed you'll have
lower amounts of insulin
4813.51 and fasting will give you
the lowest amount of insulin.
4816.52 Well, then that switch over
point is going to come earlier
4819.81 in the exercise.
4820.97 And if you think about if
you were to do something
4823.59 high intensity for 20, 30, 40 minutes,
4826.02 so maybe lift weights and
then get into Zone 2 cardio.
4829.61 If you are fasted, the literature says
4831.8 that you're going to burn
more body fat per unit time
4836.03 than if you had eaten before
or during the exercise.
4840.37 So what does this mean?
4841.203 This means if you want
to burn more body fat,
4843.45 if it's in your protocols
4845.1 and you have been approved
to do this safely,
4848.83 exercise intensely for 20 to 60 minutes,
4853.2 the higher the intensity
obviously the shorter
4855.28 that about is going to be,
4856.55 and then move over into Zone 2 cardio.
4858.66 And if you do that fasted or
the medium intensity cardio
4861.33 I should say.
4862.163 And if you do that fasted,
4864.47 then indeed you will burn a
higher percentage of body fat.
4868.79 If you need to eat or you
like to eat before you train
4871.63 that also can work.
4874.27 And if you train very intensely,
4875.98 you're likely to shift over
to the fat burning pattern
4880.06 more quickly as well.
4881.53 So again, this isn't really an issue
4883.38 of how long you exercise.
4885.65 It's an issue of how
intensely you exercise
4888.54 and therefore what fuel
source you're drawing from.
4891.47 So hopefully I've made that clear,
4893.15 but basically you need to deplete glycogen
4895.72 or through high intensity exercise
4898.0 and then move to a steady state exercise
4900.33 that will allow you to burn more fat.
4902.09 Or you need to perform a medium intensity
4905.45 or low intensity type exercise
for a long period of time
4907.99 before you shift over to burning fat.
4910.01 And indeed it seems that
going into all that fasted
4913.23 will facilitate the burning
of more fat overall.
4917.8 But if you can't even get to the exercise,
4919.86 if you're somebody who just
can't do the training at all,
4922.85 you're unwilling to or
you're incapable of training,
4925.965 unless you eat something,
4927.17 then obviously eating
something makes the most sense.
4929.27 And what you eat prior to exercise,
4930.7 that's a whole other biz
that people argue about
4933.874 and fight about whether
or not you should go
4936.04 into it with low carbohydrates
or higher carbs, all of that.
4939.08 But in general, the theme
there is very simple.
4941.34 Which is that you want insulin
levels to be pretty low
4943.71 if your goal is body fat reduction,
4946.38 if you want to oxidize body fat.
4947.93 So fasting in some cases,
4949.26 fat fasting and other cases
4950.57 where you're just ingesting fats.
4952.07 Fat and protein, in some
cases or for some people
4954.15 it will be eating carbohydrates.
4955.75 I'm not here to dictate a
particular nutrition regimen.
4959.14 That's just how the hormone
balance of these things
4961.25 and fat oxidation works.
4963.23 Now, one thing that's very interesting
4964.86 and cannot be overlooked is this issue
4967.51 of how much energy you burn
during and after the activity.
4971.97 And some of you probably
already know about this,
4973.97 but the whole business of
calories in versus calories out,
4978.63 and people counting the number of calories
4980.73 they burn during their aerobic session
4982.5 or during their whatever session
4984.81 is only one half of the equation
4987.05 and it really eclipses
the more important issue,
4989.94 which is how much of an
increase in metabolism
4994.11 does a given exercise
create after the exercise?
4998.57 And we could talk for hours about this,
5000.03 but the simple way to view this is that,
5001.86 high intensity training,
anaerobic training
5005.08 of weight training, sprints,
burpees, any kind of thing.
5009.2 I don't know these days I
hear that you're not supposed
5011.41 to do burpees that people
think burpees are dangerous.
5013.28 So I'm not suggesting any
particular movements here.
5015.09 You have to decide what's right for you.
5018.06 I do burpees.
5019.38 I don't seem to be injured from them,
5021.18 but I hear that they're
terrible for some people.
5023.31 So anyway, push-ups, sit-ups,
5025.76 whatever it happens to be
that anaerobic exercise
5028.98 that's of higher intensity or sprints
5032.81 taps into glycogen stores
during the movement
5035.82 and we'll burn more energy per unit time
5038.9 than moderate intensity.
5039.83 High intensity burns more
than modern intensity.
5041.62 That's straightforward.
5043.61 What's interesting is that all the studies
5046.84 that I was able to find on what happens
5049.27 after that type of exercise showed
5050.685 that the percentage of fat that you burn
5052.99 after high intensity
exercise is actually greater.
5056.71 In other words, you burn a lot of glycogen
5058.36 during the high intensity exercise.
5060.15 And then after the exercise,
5061.94 the post exercise oxygen consumption
5064.13 as it sometimes called goes up.
5067.24 We know this after you train intensely
5068.98 that post exercise oxygen
consumption goes up
5071.23 sometimes for up to 24 hours.
5073.92 And it is during that period of time
5075.62 that you oxidize more fat not glycogen.
5079.23 Now, what's interesting is
that the reverse is also true,
5082.93 for people that do long bouts of low
5085.2 or moderate intensity exercise.
5086.93 So typically this would
be things like running,
5088.59 swimming, biking, et cetera.
5089.71 So 60, 90 minutes, two hours
5092.05 maybe even people that
are training for marathons
5093.93 or half marathons,
5095.13 when they stop training,
5097.352 they burn more glycogen,
more carbohydrate,
5101.64 even though they were burning
more body fat per unit time
5105.45 during the low intensity exercise.
5107.13 So there's this kind of inversion.
5108.5 High-intensity burns more
glycogen during the activity,
5110.98 more body fat afterwards.
5113.3 Moderate to low intensity
burns more percentage-wise
5117.25 more body fat is oxidized than glycogen
5121.265 during the actual exercise
afterward it's more glycogen.
5124.83 So I don't want this
to get too complicated.
5127.06 The point is you should
pick exercise that you like,
5130.75 that you're going to do regularly,
5132.56 but it does seem that the
high intensity exercise
5136.34 followed by moderate intensity exercise
5139.32 is going to be optimal
for fat burning overall.
5141.93 Because when you look at the
percentage of body fat burned,
5145.43 and you look at the overall increase
5147.61 in basal metabolic rate,
5149.47 moderate and high intensity training
5152.61 followed by low intensity training
5154.88 or even just followed
by going back into life
5157.58 is going to be the best way
to continue to burn body fat
5160.69 because of the ways that it
increases basal metabolic rate.
5165.04 This could be distilled
into a simple protocol
5167.73 whereby three or four times a week
5170.37 you do high intensity training
followed by either nothing
5173.3 or followed by low intensity training
5176.61 especially if you're
able to do that fasted.
5179.5 And I should just mention
that none of this stuff
5181.74 about fasted is about performance.
5183.74 If you want to perform really well,
5185.91 this is for reasons of performance
5187.834 and you want to, you know, it's
for a sport or a competition,
5190.56 it's not for body fat purposes.
5192.2 Well, then all of this kind of falls away
5194.61 and is modified by what's
ideal to eat for performance.
5197.22 But what we're talking about today
5198.21 is how to optimize body fat loss.
5202.54 So train moderately to very high intensity
5208.24 and then moderate to low intensity,
5211.51 or train moderate to high intensity,
5213.88 and then go about life.
5215.16 And in fact, I have a friend
who uses this strategy.
5219.03 He likes the train intensely
5220.53 and not that often protocol
cause he's a very busy person.
5223.18 So he'll train for 20
or 30 minutes intensely
5225.34 with weights or just body
weight movement doing a lot,
5228.33 he does burpees and push-ups
and sit-ups and pull-ups
5230.62 and just kind of moving and
kind of circuit type training.
5233.7 But where he's breathing really hard,
5235.17 the goal he always says is,
5236.31 I want to breathe hard
for 30 minutes every day.
5238.83 And then afterwards he
hydrates and drinks coffee
5241.63 and moves into his day.
5242.68 And he's walking around and taking calls
5244.44 and carrying around his children
5245.88 and doing all these kinds of things
5246.85 that keep him really busy
5247.683 which is kind of like low intensity work.
5249.46 So I think you get the principle now.
5251.35 But you should all be asking yourselves
5253.92 as scientists of yourselves.
5256.38 Why would it be that
certain patterns of exercise
5258.94 would lead to more or less fat loss?
5261.64 I mean, it can't just be
about the energy burn.
5264.01 We already established that.
5265.55 And again, it has to do with the neurons.
5267.53 It has to do with how we
engage the nervous system.
5270.08 So while non-exercise activity
induced thermogenesis, NEAT,
5273.57 the fidgeting and cold
can induce thermogenesis
5277.6 by engaging shiver tight
movement or low-level movements.
5281.07 Big movements that are
of very high intensity,
5284.49 meaning they require a lot of effort,
5286.01 deploy a lot of adrenaline
epinephrin from our neurons
5289.82 and signal particular types
5292.98 and amounts of fat
thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
5298.16 whereas low level intensity exercise,
5300.5 low or moderate intensity exercise,
5302.41 walking, running, biking
5303.89 where you can do that easily,
5305.16 there's not very much adrenaline release.
5307.11 So adrenaline aka epinephrin
5311.45 is really the final common path
5313.66 by which movement of any kind,
5315.92 whether or not it's low level shiver,
5317.41 whether or not it's lifting
a barbell sprinting up a hill
5320.72 or doing a long bike ride.
5322.36 Adrenaline is the effector of fat loss.
5326.95 It's the trigger end, it's the effector.
5329.56 So now I want to turn our
attention to compounds
5332.91 that increase epinephrin and adrenaline,
5335.55 as well as compounds that work outside
5338.29 the adrenaline epinephrin pathway
5340.77 to increase the rates of fat loss.
5343.12 I almost always save
compounds and supplements
5346.21 and things of that sort to the end,
5347.99 because I do believe that
people should look first
5350.84 towards behavioral tools and
an understanding of the science
5354.27 before they look toward a supplement
5357.3 or a particular thing that
they can extract from diet.
5361.32 This is mainly to try
and shift people away
5363.07 from the kind of magic
pill phenomenon or the idea
5366.02 that there is a magic pill
because there really isn't.
5368.13 And frankly, there never will be.
5369.7 But there are some compounds
5370.95 that can greatly increase fat
oxidation and mobilization.
5374.63 And understanding which
compounds increase oxidation
5378.34 or mobilization can be very useful
5381.01 if your goal is to accelerate fat loss.
5383.87 There are things that people can ingest
5386.37 that will allow them to oxidize more fat.
5390.09 And that occurs mainly
by increasing the amount
5392.58 of epinephrin that is
released from neurons
5395.16 that innovate fat tissue.
5397.31 One of the more common ones is one
5399.15 that you may already be
using which is caffeine.
5402.67 It's well-established that
caffeine can enhance performance,
5406.82 if you're caffeine adapted.
5408.28 I talked about this in an earlier episode
5410.22 so I want to make sure
I'm very clear about this.
5412.17 If you are not used to drinking caffeine
5414.43 and you suddenly decide I'm going to drink
5417.42 a big cup of coffee before training,
5420.17 you will vasoconstrict and
you will limit performance.
5424.25 So that's performance.
5425.53 If you're caffeine adapted however,
5428.06 there's this kind of
interesting phenomenon
5429.95 where ingestion of caffeine
5431.67 serves more as a performance enhancer,
5434.7 both by increasing alertness,
5436.16 but also by way of dilating vasculature
5439.94 of allowing more blood flow.
5442.44 Now, caffeine for burning
more fat for oxidizing
5446.72 and mobilizing more fat
is an interesting one.
5450.05 It can be effective at
dosages up to 400 milligrams.
5454.59 You have to be careful if
you're caffeine sensitive.
5456.95 Some people have just the
littlest bit of caffeine
5458.98 and their mind goes crazy,
5460.77 and they're very uncomfortable.
5462.0 It can have cardiovascular
effects for some people
5464.13 or hypertension, et cetera.
5465.3 So please check with your doctor.
5467.07 But 400 milligrams is roughly
a cup and a half a coffee
5472.21 or two cups of coffee.
5473.3 Nowadays, there's a lot
more caffeine in coffee.
5476.53 So if you go to a typical cafe
5479.79 and you were to get their medium-sized
5482.67 that would have close
to a gram of caffeine,
5485.25 which is why, if you're a
regular caffeine consumer
5488.49 and you don't get that gram of caffeine
5490.33 in your coffee each day,
you will get a headache.
5492.35 It can cause constriction
and dilation of blood vessels
5495.25 in ways that's complicated,
5497.05 but you'll get a headache.
5499.15 Some people like the
way they feel drinking
5502.62 100 to 200, 300 maybe 400
milligrams of caffeine
5505.69 before training.
5506.523 And indeed that will lead
to increase fat oxidation.
5509.41 It will do that because you
will release more epinephrin
5512.28 and adrenaline.
5513.51 So let's just place this in the context
5515.74 of what we said previously.
5516.87 Let's say you normally do Zone 2 cardio,
5519.52 so you're going out for
a moderately intense run
5522.63 for 30 to 60 minutes or so.
5525.09 I think the current recommendation
guidelines in the States
5528.12 are that people engage in 30 minutes
5531.61 of moderate intensity
exercise five days a week
5535.85 for that's 150 minutes.
5538.57 If their goal is to improve
5540.46 or maintain health of the
cardiovascular system.
5544.85 80% of people in the United
States fail to do that,
5547.95 or anything close to it.
5549.93 We are way below threshold
for what the government
5552.76 has recommended.
5553.593 In this case, the
government recommendations,
5555.06 I think are pretty good.
5556.25 That's one could always
do better of course.
5558.83 But 80% of people aren't even doing that.
5561.5 However, just using the logic
5564.082 and the understanding of
how epinephrin adrenaline
5567.27 is affecting this fat oxidation process.
5569.52 If you were to go out for 15 minutes
5571.99 and you drank caffeine before you went,
5574.42 yes, you'll probably oxidize
more fat per unit time.
5578.89 Can you compensate for the exercise
5581.59 you're not doing just
by drinking caffeine?
5584.04 Well, probably if you were
just talking about fat loss,
5587.43 if that caffeine makes
you fidget a lot, right?
5590.09 The amount of calories that
you burn in a 30 minute run,
5593.25 unless the run is very intense
5594.9 and you're wearing a weight
vest and it's up a hill,
5596.94 it's not that great, right?
5598.603 Then you probably get you in somewhere
5600.25 into the 400, 500 calories burned area.
5604.37 But I said earlier, and
there are a lot of data now
5607.18 to support that fidgeting for a day
5608.6 can burn anywhere from 800
to 2,500 calories a day.
5611.69 So you might say, well,
fidgeting is better than running,
5613.65 ah, but it doesn't trigger the activation
5615.72 and the positive health effects
5617.95 of the cardiovascular system.
5619.7 So fidgeting alone can be great,
5622.39 but you need exercise for other reasons.
5625.6 Caffeine can enhance the amount of fat
5627.243 that you burn in any duration of exercise.
5630.15 And it can shift the percentage of fat
5632.46 that you oxidize compared to glycogen.
5635.63 Unless you take that caffeine
and it ramps you up so much
5639.4 that you're training
really, really intensely.
5641.63 The bottom line is,
5642.81 if you like caffeine and
you can use it safely,
5646.01 ingesting somewhere between
104 milligrams of caffeine
5649.82 prior to exercise somewhere
between 30 to 40 minutes
5653.09 before exercise can be beneficial
5655.857 if we're talking about fat
oxidation burning more body fat.
5660.73 So that's caffeine.
5662.01 There are a number of other things
5663.1 that have existed over the
years that are in this pathway,
5665.6 things like ephedrine which
is now illegal in most states,
5671.07 I think maybe an all states
5672.37 because people were dropping
dead from taking ephedrine,
5675.33 because they were heating up too much.
5677.41 It's interesting it wasn't
direct effects on the heart
5679.96 causing heart attack.
5681.29 It could trigger by way
of adrenergic receptors.
5685.95 If you'd like to know,
5687.4 increases in body temperature and heat.
5690.57 Now, those drugs turned
out to be dangerous,
5693.87 because people were overheating and dying.
5695.5 There was also the big Fen-Phen craze.
5697.61 That was a drug that was
released fenfluramine
5701.26 which actually was quite effective
5703.89 as an anti obesity drug,
5705.64 a treatment for obesity that
had to be outlawed as well.
5710.13 It was FDA approval was removed
5713.66 because again people were dying
5715.21 because of cardiovascular effects.
5717.04 I don't know if people were
overheating on it as well.
5719.8 So what is the solution?
5721.46 If caffeine is the kind of the
entry point for most people
5724.9 of using compounds to increase the rate
5727.04 or percentage of fat loss in
exercise and even at rest,
5731.22 what are some of the other
things that are useful
5733.41 and interesting?
5734.243 Well, in terms of tools
that are actionable
5736.55 and have reasonable safety margins,
5738.94 I've talked before about
something called GLP-1.
5743.57 This is something that can be triggered
5746.2 by the ingestion of yerba
mate, which is a tea,
5748.687 and I guess because I'm half Argentine,
5751.47 we grew up drinking mate.
5752.67 I think I was drinking mate from the time
5754.12 I was about three or four years old.
5756.01 I don't suggest that for kids.
5757.45 I don't think kids should
be ingesting caffeine.
5760.57 But anyway I did it and
I still ingest mate.
5764.83 Mate increases GLP-1.
5767.49 GLP-1 is in the glucagon pathway.
5770.71 So let's just quickly
return to our biochemistry.
5773.08 As you recall, fat is
mobilized from body fat stores
5777.43 and then it's burned up.
5778.9 It's oxidized in cells.
5780.75 It actually needs to
be converted into ATP.
5784.1 And those fatty acids are
essentially converted into ATP
5788.81 in the mitochondria of the cell.
5791.07 High insulin prevents that from happening
5794.81 and glucagon facilitates that process.
5799.58 Glucagon facilitates that process
5801.88 through increases in GLP-1.
5804.5 The short takeaway is mate increases GLP-1
5809.33 and yes, increases the percentage
of fat that you will burn.
5812.63 It increases fat burning.
5814.4 And that is especially true,
5815.86 it turns out from the
scientific literature,
5817.99 if you ingest mate prior
to exercise of any kind.
5822.06 So if you want to burn
more fat drinking mate
5826.05 before exercise is good.
5828.23 Drinking it at rest when
you're not exercising
5831.26 will also help shift your metabolism
5833.57 toward enhanced burning of fat
by increasing fat oxidation.
5838.1 Now, there's a whole
category of pharmaceuticals
5841.38 that's being developed right now
5842.87 that are in late stage trials
5845.48 or are in use for the
treatment of diabetes
5847.86 which capitalize on this GLP-1 pathway.
5852.09 They go by various names
5853.96 and there are people on the internet
5855.96 who are selling these things.
5857.32 They are prescription drugs
5858.67 and I want to emphasize that
they are prescription drugs
5861.01 and you obviously wouldn't want to use
5862.5 any of these without a
prescription and a requirement.
5865.68 It does seem that they are effective
5867.14 for the treatment of
certain kinds of diabetes
5869.94 and lead to fairly significant weight loss
5873.99 and reduction in appetite.
5875.67 So this is kind of the
modern version of GLP-1
5879.63 is pharmaceuticals of GLP-1 metabolism
5883.84 are drugs such as somatical,
5887.3 I can never pronounce this.
5888.64 I can't seem to pronounce
many things it seems.
5891.12 Semaglutide is the way
I would pronounce it.
5894.04 S-E-M-A-G-L-U-T-I-D-E.
5900.096 Semaglutide but that's not
the way you pronounce it.
5902.34 But Semaglutide is the way
that it's been described
5905.11 on the internet.
5906.59 In any case, this
compound increases GLP-1.
5910.52 It's actually a GLP-1
analog in some cases,
5913.46 and they go by various
types of trade names.
5917.36 So the GLP-1 pathway is interesting.
5919.35 Most people, including myself,
5921.45 are not interested in
taking a prescription drug
5923.37 to increase GLP-1,
5924.49 I do it through the ingestion of mate.
5926.46 I just get the mate leaves,
pour water over it and drink it.
5929.32 What's kind of interesting,
5930.6 that's not often discussed
5932.4 is that you can increase
the amount of GLP-1 by,
5938.04 you can essentially reuse the tea.
5940.3 The first time you drink it
it can be very, very intense.
5943.59 And in fact, some people find that mate
5946.51 almost tastes like burnt leaves.
5948.01 It's too intense.
5948.843 You don't want the water to be too hot.
5950.6 But I learned this trick from a friend.
5952.52 You can reuse the leaves
over and over again,
5954.69 probably for about a
day before they go bad.
5956.82 And in doing that, you start
to extract more and more
5959.81 of the compounds from the mate
leaf that increased GLP-1.
5963.01 So it's kind of cool.
5963.843 You can kind of get an increased effect.
5965.36 So what I'll typically do is
make a about 16 to 30 ounces
5969.31 and just sip it throughout the day,
5970.35 and I do like it before I train.
5972.07 Some people who don't like mate
5974.62 might prefer something like guayusa,
5977.35 which is spelled G-U-A-Y-U-S-A.
5981.8 G-U-A-Y-U-S-A, guayusa
which is from Ecuador,
5986.6 despite the USA ending to it.
5988.67 It's from Ecuador.
5989.503 And it's a sweeter tasting tea.
5992.58 It doesn't have any sweetener in it,
5994.41 but the leaf of the
guayusa plant is sweeter
5997.18 than the mate plant.
5998.53 I sometimes will mix the two
6000.06 and then make the tea with that.
6002.61 There's no mate or guayusa
sponsor of the podcast.
6005.34 These are just tools to increase
GLP-1 and fat oxidation.
6009.7 And again, the Semaglutide
is the prescription version
6014.64 of the that's kind of the heavy
artillery GLP-1 stimulant,
6018.89 and again should be only
explored with a prescription.
6022.12 So those are the compounds
6024.926 that really increase
fat oxidation directly.
6028.42 There are going to be a number
of things that impact insulin
6031.53 and glucagon that are
going to shift the body
6036.23 toward more fat burning.
6037.57 We talked about a lot of
these during the episode
6040.15 on hormones.
6041.46 We talked about it.
6042.293 We did a whole episode on
hormones and metabolism.
6044.49 And so for instance, berberine,
6046.72 which comes from a plant
or metformin are compounds
6050.87 that are now in kind of growing use
6054.07 for reducing blood glucose.
6055.67 They are very potent at
reducing blood glucose,
6058.55 which will reduce insulin because the job
6060.75 of the hormone insulin is to
essentially manage glucose
6064.39 in the bloodstream.
6065.57 So there are a huge gallery of compounds
6068.56 that will reduce insulin
6070.2 and thereby can increase fat oxidation.
6072.96 And that's because, as I mentioned before,
6075.35 fat oxidation, this conversion
of fatty acids into ATP
6079.01 in the mitochondria is
inhibited by insulin.
6081.52 So if you keep insulin low,
6082.97 you're going to increase that process.
6085.07 Which brings us full circle back
6087.31 to the issue of diet and nutrition.
6090.18 There is really solid
evidence from the Gardner Lab
6096.63 at Stanford and from
other labs showing that,
6098.45 when you look at different diets,
6100.31 you look at low fat diets,
6101.99 high fat diets,
6103.11 keto diets, intermittent fasting,
6106.97 provided people stick to
their particular diet,
6109.34 it doesn't really matter
which diet you follow.
6112.7 You can still get a caloric deficit
6114.29 and you get weight loss.
6116.44 Adherence however is always an issue.
6118.75 And so what I always say is,
6120.29 that you want to use the eating plan
6122.96 that is obviously
beneficial to your health,
6125.67 but the one that allows you to adhere
6128.07 to whatever it is that the
particular nutrition protocol is,
6132.3 right?
6133.133 If you can't stick with something,
6134.29 then it's not very worthwhile.
6136.02 But from the purely scientific standpoint,
6139.11 there's also an advantage
to keeping insulin low.
6142.94 Now, that doesn't necessarily mean
6144.09 you go to zero carbohydrate.
6145.7 I've talked before about
my preferred way of eating
6148.12 is to go lower or no
carbohydrates throughout the day
6150.27 for alertness to get that
adrenaline release and the focus
6153.44 that goes with it, et cetera,
6154.71 and the ability to think and move
6156.59 and do all the things I
need to do during the day.
6158.45 And then I eat carbohydrates at night
6159.9 'cause it facilitates
the transition to sleep.
6161.76 That's what works for me.
6163.82 But when insulin is low,
6166.73 you do place your system in a
position to oxidize more fat.
6172.12 And so that's why I think a
lot of people do see benefit
6174.76 from lower carbohydrate or
moderate carbohydrate diets,
6177.94 because when insulin is low,
6179.44 you are in a position to oxidize more fat.
6182.3 Both from exercise and at rest.
6184.68 And I should mention,
because I often mention
6187.44 and it's appropriate to mention
6188.71 that if you're interested
in looking at the effects
6190.96 of caffeine, of mate,
guayusa things of that sort,
6194.7 GLP-1 you want to learn more about those.
6197.01 You can go to this wonderful website
6198.75 which is free www.examine.com.
6202.36 You can put in yerba mate,
6203.81 it will describe the three studies
6206.15 that show increased fat oxidation,
6209.48 both during exercise and at rest,
6211.81 and as a consequence not
surprisingly and increase
6214.4 in metabolic rate.
6215.798 One thing that's interesting about mate
6218.96 is it causes a slight
decrease in heart rate
6221.84 for reasons that still escape me.
6224.67 There's a single study showing
6226.47 that heart rate is slightly reduced
6229.5 which is kind of nice because if,
6231.07 when I drink too much caffeine
6232.31 my heart rate goes up,
6233.29 maybe that would increase my
fidgeting and my fat burning,
6235.73 but I don't like the feeling
of having my basal heart rate
6238.14 being up too high.
6239.31 I like my heart rate
elevate during exercise,
6241.24 but not when I'm just kind of resting
6242.73 or working and throughout the day.
6244.43 And for some reason
that I don't understand
6247.89 there's an effect of mate
of increasing fat oxidation
6251.84 but reducing heart rate just slightly.
6254.56 So that's interesting.
6255.59 And it probably lends itself [indistinct]
6258.31 explains the subjective experience
6259.82 that I've had of that mate
has kind of a little nice
6261.73 even mellow stimulant.
6264.48 It's not this really supercharged
stimulant like caffeine
6268.48 from coffee or other sources.
6270.2 Although if you drink too much mate
6271.4 it will also make you jittery.
6273.86 And there's one more compound
that I think we should discuss
6276.63 in terms of increasing fat loss,
6278.59 and that's carnitine
or acetyl-L-carnitine,
6281.75 they lie in the same pathway.
6284.47 We can return to our basic
knowledge now of fat mobilization
6288.73 and oxidation.
6290.61 After fat is mobilized
and makes it into cells
6294.28 and needs to be oxidized.
6295.71 So the literally the burning of fat
6297.65 and conversion of it into energy
6300.45 that is accomplished and is facilitated
6304.6 by the presence of
glucagon being elevated,
6308.47 GLP increases that process
and insulin being low.
6314.98 And we talked about some
ways to manage insulin
6318.12 both in this episode
and in previous episode.
6321.8 L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine
6324.9 in particular facilitates fat oxidation.
6329.4 It helps convert fatty acids into ATP.
6333.2 And indeed supplementing
L-carnitine can increase fat loss.
6336.93 That's been shown.
6339.15 At what dosages?
6340.55 Well, people ingest
anywhere from 500 milligrams
6343.681 to two grams per day in
divided doses typically.
6347.95 Some people who are really extreme
6349.65 are taking injectable L-carnitine,
6352.67 I've certainly not tried that.
6355.38 I confess I have used it in
pill form from time to time
6358.07 but in part, because of
the fat oxidation effects,
6361.16 but also because of the other
effects that it tends to have.
6364.42 So in exploring the effects
that acetyl-L-carnitine has,
6367.73 it has a huge variety of
effects on cellar metabolism.
6371.18 It can reduce ammonia in the blood
6374.01 that is actually a quite strong effect.
6376.01 It can reduce things
like C-reactive protein,
6378.09 which is you want to
C-reactive protein levels
6381.31 to be managed.
6382.16 You do not want them too high.
6383.43 Can slightly reduce blood glucose.
6386.37 I can slightly increase HDLC,
6388.74 the good form of the blood lipid
6391.49 and slightly reduce overall cholesterol.
6394.02 And as I mentioned, it can slightly modify
6398.2 the pathway involving glucagon,
6400.15 such that you get a considerable effect,
6401.89 not a huge effect on fat oxidation,
6404.06 so it can improve pat oxidation rates.
6406.71 It has a number of other effects,
6408.09 some of which I talked
during the month on hormones
6411.65 and that sort of thing.
6413.75 It has strong effects
on rates of pregnancy
6417.12 and sperm quality.
6418.19 So clearly carnitine is doing
lots of different things
6420.47 and lots of different cells.
6422.06 It's impacting sperm motility.
6424.02 They're in a large number
of studies supporting that.
6427.09 Slight reductions in blood pressure
6429.56 and has these interesting
effects on reducing fatigue
6432.732 during exercise,
6434.1 reducing inflammatory
markers like interleukin 6.
6437.04 So it has a number of
effects that on the whole
6439.87 are quote unquote positive
or at least in the direction
6442.76 of things that you may want.
6444.2 And I should emphasize may.
6445.53 You certainly don't need
a acetyl-L-carnitine
6447.73 in order to lose fat,
6450.2 but now that you understand
the cellular process
6453.3 by which fat is mobilized and oxidized,
6456.03 it should make sense that if L-carnitine
6457.84 is important for converting
fatty acids into energy,
6462.71 then supplementing L-carnitine make sense.
6467.02 Acetyl-L-carnitine is
the type of L-carnitine
6470.55 or the form of L-carnitine I should say,
6472.46 that is transported and utilized
most easily by the body.
6476.437 And so that's why sometimes we distinguish
6478.26 between L-carnitine
and acetyl-L-carnitine.
6481.21 So once again, we've covered
an enormous amount of material.
6485.6 We've talked about the science of fat loss
6488.58 and in particular, we've
explored this topic
6491.73 from the perspective
of the nervous system.
6494.48 How neurons and in particular
the release of things
6497.56 like adrenaline, epinephrin
can facilitate fat mobilization
6502.84 and oxidation.
6504.38 We talked about NEAT, fidgeting,
6507.09 this non-exercise type movement
6510.68 that can greatly increase caloric burn.
6513.97 And why that is.
6515.65 We talked about shiver,
6516.78 another form of non-exercise movement
6519.73 that can really increase
both caloric expenditure
6522.83 due to the shiver, due to the movement,
6524.8 as well as increase thermogenesis
the heating up of the body
6529.05 through things like brown fat,
6530.44 and even the conversion
of white fat to brown fat
6533.36 which is a good thing if
you want to oxidize fat.
6536.77 We talked about cold as
a particular stimulus
6539.212 to induce shiver and
how to use getting into,
6543.99 an out of cold as a
way to stimulate shiver
6547.17 and avoid cold adaptation
so that you continue
6550.55 to oxidize and burn fat,
if that's your goal.
6553.86 If you want to check out
the protocols for that,
6556.57 there at www.thecoldplunge.com
6559.11 and in weeks to come
we're going to be adding
6561.5 more protocols to that website
6563.26 not just for fat loss,
6564.73 but for things like resilience,
6566.357 reducing inflammation, et cetera.
6568.6 So be sure to check those out again,
6569.99 those are totally cost-free.
6572.07 Talked about exercise.
6573.9 How rather than thinking
about cardiovascular
6576.3 or weight training exercise,
6578.13 that we should perhaps
look through the lens
6580.75 of this adrenaline system
and how it interacts
6582.81 with fat stores and
think about low, medium
6586.21 or high intensity exercise.
6588.05 Whether or not we show
up to that fasted or not.
6590.01 Turns out showing up to
that fasted can be useful,
6593.27 if you start with high intensity movements
6595.92 and then move into lower
intensity type exercise.
6600.52 If you're going to go long duration,
6602.27 it probably doesn't matter
unless you're exercising longer
6605.04 than 90 minutes, whether
or not you eat or not.
6608.83 We talked about caffeine as a stimulant
6612.01 and a stimulus for epinephrin
and adrenaline release
6616.35 as a way to access more fat metabolism.
6620.0 And we talked about compounds
6621.78 that come from things like
yerba mate and guayusa tea,
6625.91 this GLP-1 pathway that can
trigger increased fat oxidation
6630.88 so much so that the
pharmaceutical companies
6632.97 are now developing compounds specifically
6634.93 to increase GLP-1 for treatment
of diabetes and obesity.
6639.37 But you can leverage the GLP-1 pathway
6641.85 through the ingestion of things like mate
6643.68 or guayusa if that's of interest to you.
6647.06 And then we talked about L-carnitine
6648.93 and how L-carnitine itself is critical
6651.84 for the fat oxidation
within individual cells.
6654.21 The conversion of fatty acids to energy.
6656.88 And why having your insulin low
6660.34 and things like L-carnitine
and glucagon levels
6663.53 high or sufficient at least can facilitate
6667.697 the burning of fat, fat oxidation.
6670.58 So we covered a lot of material.
6671.78 That's a lot of protocols
I realize that didn't...
6675.03 The little list I just gave right there
6676.43 didn't even begin to
get into all the details
6679.13 and corners that we discussed.
6680.503 I hope you found this
conversation interesting
6683.81 both for sake of understanding fat loss
6686.21 and how to lose fat more
quickly and to lose more of it,
6689.14 if that's your goal.
6690.83 As well as simply to
understand the biology
6693.25 of fat metabolism from
a different perspective,
6695.25 from the perspective
of the nervous system.
