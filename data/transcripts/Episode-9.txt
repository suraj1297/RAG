0.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the Huberman Lab podcast,
2.25 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.68 for everyday life.
5.43 [MUSIC PLAYING]
9.355 I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor
11.11 of neurobiology
and ophthalmology
13.39 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.07 Today my guest is
Dr. Sam Harris.
17.65 Dr. Sam Harris did his
undergraduate training
20.02 in philosophy at
Stanford University
22.69 and then went on to do his
doctorate in neuroscience
25.03 at the University of
California at Los Angeles.
27.77 He is well known
as an author who
29.47 has written about
everything from meditation
31.96 to consciousness, free will.
33.91 And he holds many
strong political views
36.07 that he's voiced on social
media and in the content
38.56 of various books as they relate
to philosophy and neuroscience.
42.28 During today's
episode, I mainly talk
44.53 to Dr. Harris about his
views and practices related
47.44 to meditation,
consciousness, and free will.
50.77 In fact, he made
several important points
52.96 about what a proper meditation
practice can accomplish.
55.93 Prior to this episode, I
thought that meditation
58.72 was about deliberately changing
one's conscious experience
61.81 in order to achieve
things such as deeper
64.209 relaxation, a heightened
sense of focus or ability
67.15 to focus generally,
elevated memory, and so on.
70.75 What Sam taught me and what
you'll soon learn as well
73.27 is that while
meditation does indeed
75.28 hold all of those
valuable benefits,
77.53 the main value of a
meditation practice,
79.81 or perhaps the greater value
of a meditation practice,
82.99 is that it doesn't
just allow one
85.72 to change their
conscious experience,
87.7 but it actually can
allow a human being
90.19 to view consciousness itself.
92.08 That is to understand what the
process of consciousness is.
95.89 And in doing so, to
profoundly shift the way
98.74 that one engages with the
world and with oneself
101.2 in all practices, all
environments, and at all times,
105.11 both in sleep and
in waking states.
107.41 And in that way
making meditation
109.3 perhaps the most potent
and important portal
112.93 by which one can access novel
ways of thinking and being
116.89 and viewing one's
life experience.
118.79 We also discussed the so-called
mind-body problem and issues
122.11 of duality and free will.
124.03 Concepts from philosophy and
neuroscience that, fortunately,
126.88 thanks to valuable experiments
and deep thinking on the part
131.11 of people like Dr.
Sam Harris and others,
133.84 is now leading people to
understand really what free
137.11 will is and isn't.
138.7 Where the locus of free will
likely sits in the brain,
141.73 if it indeed resides
in the brain at all.
144.32 And what it means to
be a conscious being
147.16 and how we can modify our
conscious states in ways that
149.71 allow us to be more functional.
151.34 We also discuss perception,
both visual perception auditory
154.24 perception, and especially
interesting to me,
157.03 and I think as well, hopefully
to you, time perception,
160.84 which we know is very
elastic in the brain.
164.08 The literal frame
rate by which we
166.33 process our conscious experience
can expand and contract
169.84 dramatically depending
on our state of mind
172.75 and how conscious we are
about our state of mind.
175.42 So we went deep into
that topic as well.
177.95 Today's discussion was indeed
an intellectual deep dive
180.97 into all the topics that I
mentioned a few moments ago,
183.74 but it also included
many practical tools.
186.07 In fact, I pushed
Sam to share with us
188.71 what his specific practices
are and how we can all
192.01 arrive at a clearer and better
understanding of a meditation
195.28 practice that we can
each and all apply.
197.5 So that we can derive these
incredible benefits, not just
200.53 the ones related to stress
and focus and enhanced memory,
203.44 but the ones that relate
to our consciousness.
206.32 That is to our deeper sense
of self and to others.
209.23 Several times during
today's episode,
210.85 I mentioned the Waing Up app.
212.41 The Waking Up app was
developed by Sam Harris,
214.72 but I want to emphasize that my
mention of the app is in no way
218.14 a paid promotional.
219.22 Rather the Waking Up
app is one that I've
221.05 used for some period of time
now and find very, very useful.
224.525 I have family members
that also use it.
226.15 Other staff members here
at the Huberman Lab podcast
228.43 use it because we find it
to be such a powerful tool.
231.52 Sam has generously offered
Huberman Lab podcast listeners
234.4 a 30-day completely free
trial of the Waking Up app.
237.542 If any of you want to
try it, you can simply go
239.5 to wakingup.com/huberman to
get that 30-day free trial.
243.252 During today's
discussion, we didn't just
244.96 talk about meditation
consciousness and free will.
247.81 We also talked
about psychedelics.
249.34 Both their therapeutic
applications for the treatment
251.65 of things like
depression and PTSD,
254.06 but also the use
of psychedelics.
255.85 And we discussed Sam's
experiences with psychedelics
258.519 as they relate to expanding
one's consciousness.
261.1 I also asked Sam about
his views and practices
263.74 related to social media.
265.39 Prompted in no small part by
his recent voluntary decision
269.11 to close down his
Twitter account.
271.06 So we talked about his
rationale for doing that,
273.58 how he feels about doing that.
275.44 And I think you'll find that
to be very interesting as well.
277.94 Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize
279.612 that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research
282.07 roles at Stanford.
283.12 It is, however, part of my
desire and effort to bring
285.43 zero-cost-to-consumer
information about science
287.65 and science-related tools
to the general public.
290.23 In keeping with
that theme, I'd like
291.73 to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.
294.26 Our first sponsor is Levels.
296.08 Levels is a program that lets
you see how different foods
298.78 and behaviors affect
your health by giving you
300.97 real-time feedback using a
continuous glucose monitor.
304.51 One of the most
important factors
305.92 in your immediate
and long-term health
307.503 are your blood sugar levels.
308.692 And not just your overall blood
sugar levels but your blood
311.15 sugar levels throughout the day
in response to different foods
313.733 you eat, to fasting if you're
into fasting, to exercise,
317.16 and so forth.
318.14 I started using Levels
some time ago in order
321.02 to figure out how different
foods impact my blood sugar
323.54 levels, and indeed, it
does that very well.
325.88 It allowed me to see
how certain foods really
327.8 spike my blood sugar and
others keep it more level.
330.44 And in particular, how foods
that I eat after exercise
333.29 can help raise my blood
glucose just enough but not so
335.9 much that then I get a crash
two or three hours later,
338.25 which was what was happening
before I started using Levels.
340.79 I've made certain
adjustments to my diet.
342.53 I can now eat post-exercise
and still have plenty of energy
345.62 throughout the day
without any issues.
347.45 It also has helped me understand
how different behaviors impact
350.48 my blood glucose levels.
351.68 If you're interested in learning
more about Levels and trying
354.222 a continuous glucose
monitor yourself,
356.0 go to levels.link/huberman.
358.49 Again that's levels.link
spelled L-I-N-K /huberman.
362.6 Today's episode is also
brought to us by WHOOP.
365.21 WHOOP is a fitness
wearable device
366.95 that tracks your daily
activity and sleep
369.05 but goes beyond activity
and sleep tracking
371.36 to provide real-time feedback
on how to adjust your training
374.42 and sleep schedules in order
to feel and perform better.
377.57 Six months ago, I started
working with WHOOP
379.52 as a member of their
scientific advisory council
381.95 as a way to help WHOOP advance
their mission of unlocking
384.77 human performance.
386.25 And as a WHOOP user,
I've experienced
387.92 firsthand the health
benefits of their technology.
390.98 It's clear, based
on quality research,
392.84 that WHOOP can inform you
how well you're sleeping,
395.18 how to change your
sleep habits, how
396.68 to change your activity habits.
398.06 Even how to modify different
aspects of your nutrition,
401.01 exercise, sleep, and
lifestyle in order
403.46 to maximize your
mental health, physical
405.32 health, and performance.
406.32 So whether or not
you're an athlete
407.39 or you're exercising
simply for health,
409.28 WHOOP can really
help you understand
411.2 how your body functions
under different conditions
413.6 and how to really program
your schedule, nutrition
415.97 and exercise, and many
other factors of your life
418.73 in order to really optimize
your health and performance,
421.32 including your cognition.
422.798 If you're interested
in trying WHOOP,
424.34 you can go to join WHOOP
spelled whoop.com/huberman.
429.11 That's join whoop.com/huberman

432.75 free.
433.25 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
436.01 Eight Sleep make smart mattress
covers with cooling, heating,
438.71 and sleep-tracking capacity.
440.51 I've talked many times
before on this podcast
442.58 about the fact that sleep
is the fundamental layer
445.22 of mental health, physical
health, and performance.
447.45 Now one of the key things for
getting a great night's sleep
449.908 every single night is to
optimize the temperature
452.36 of your sleeping environment.
453.8 Put simply, in order to fall
asleep and stay deeply asleep,
457.22 your body temperature needs to
drop by about 1 to 3 degrees.
460.22 And waking up, on
the other hand,
461.97 involves a heating of your
body by about 1 to 3 degrees.
465.47 With Eight sleep, you
can tune the temperature
468.35 of your mattress
cover or mattress
470.36 to be cooler or hotter depending
on whether or not you tend
473.48 to run too hot or too cold.
474.86 And you can even vary
it across the night
476.63 so that you can access the best
deep sleep early in the night.
479.51 The so-called REM sleep,
rapid eye movement sleep,
481.64 that's more pronounced in
the later half of the night.
483.89 And doing so really
get your sleep
485.39 optimized not just
in terms of duration
487.52 but in terms of quality and
the overall architecture
490.04 of your sleep.
490.73 This has a profound influence
on your alertness, focus, mood,
493.993 and many other important
factors throughout the day.
496.16 If you'd like to

511.325 The Huberman Lab podcast
is proud to announce
513.2 that we are now partnered
with Momentous supplements.
515.455 Because Momentous
supplements are
516.83 of the very highest quality.
518.24 They ship internationally,
and they have
520.37 single-ingredient formulations.
521.718 If you'd like to access
the supplements discussed
523.76 on the Huberman Lab podcast,
you can go to live momentous
526.61 spelled O-U-S so
livemomentous.com/huberman.
530.36 And now, for my discussion
with Dr. Sam Harris.
533.6 Dr. Sam Harris.
534.65 SAM HARRIS: [LAUGHTER]
536.3 ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're
just talking about this.
537.35 SAM HARRIS: Yes, doctor.
537.605 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
are indeed a doctor.
538.91 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
539.743 SAM HARRIS: I cannot save
your life, but I am--
542.34 I might save your non-existent
soul if we talk long enough.
545.652 ANDREW HUBERMAN: [LAUGHTER]
Well, neither of us
547.61 are clinicians, but
we are both brain
550.61 explorers from the
different perspectives.
553.712 Some overlapping.
554.42 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
555.29 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I'm
really excited to have
556.64 this conversation.
557.6 I've been listening to
your voice for many years
560.63 learning from you
for many years.
562.35 And I'd be remiss
if I didn't say
564.65 that my father, who's
also a scientist,
567.44 is an enormous fan of
your Waking Up app.
570.772 SAM HARRIS: Nice.
571.48 That's great.
571.61 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
has spent a lot of time
573.83 over the last few years.
575.87 He's in his late 70s.
577.07 He's almost 80.
578.21 He's a theoretical
physicist walking
580.31 to the park near his
apartment and spending
582.47 time meditating with the app.
584.143 Or sometimes
separate from the app
585.56 but using the same sorts
of meditations in his head.
587.785 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
588.26 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So he kind
of toggles back and forth.
590.51 And even-- I
shouldn't say-- even
592.73 but-- yes, even in
his late 70s, has
595.16 reported that it
has significantly
597.68 shifted his awareness of self
and his conscious experience
602.54 of things happening
in and around him.
605.12 And he was somebody
who, I think,
607.72 already saw himself as
a pretty aware person.
612.472 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
613.18 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thinking about
quantum mechanics and the rest.
616.72 So a thank you from
him indirectly.
618.64 SAM HARRIS: Oh, that's great.
619.848 ANDREW HUBERMAN: A thank
you from me now directly.
622.63 And I really want to use that as
a way to frame up what I think
625.63 is one of the more interesting
questions in not just science
629.23 and philosophy and
psychology but all of life,
631.94 which is what is this
thing that we call a self?
635.62 As far as I know, we have
not localized the region
638.92 in the brain that
can entirely account
641.41 for our perception of self.
643.18 There are areas, of course,
that regulate proprioception,
646.21 our awareness of where
our limbs are in space.
648.8 Maybe even our awareness of
where we are in physical space.
651.73 There are such circuits,
as we both know.
653.62 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
654.328 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But when
we talk about sense of self,
657.93 I have to remember this kind
of neuroscience 101 thing
661.818 that we always say.
662.61 When you teach memory, you
say you wake up every morning,
665.13 and you remember who you are.
666.48 You know who you are.
667.62 Most people do.
668.85 Even if they lack memory systems
in the brain for whatever
671.58 reason, pretty much everyone
seems to know who they are.
675.52 What are your thoughts on what
that whole thing is about?
678.9 And do we come into the
world feeling that way?
681.36 I would appreciate answers from
the perspective of any field--
685.922 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
686.63 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --including
neuroscience, of course.
687.83 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
688.05 Well, big question.
688.98 I mean, the problem is we
use the term self in so
691.98 many different ways, right.
693.36 And there's one sense
of that term, which
698.4 is the target of
meditation, and it's
700.59 the target of deconstruction
by the practice and by,
703.65 as you said, any
surrounding philosophy.
705.42 So you'll hear, and
you'll hear it from me,
708.03 that this self is
an illusion, right.
711.48 And that there's a
psychological freedom that
714.84 can be experienced on the
other side of discovering
717.0 it to be an illusion.
719.683 And some people don't
like that framing.
721.35 Some people would insist that
it's not so much an illusion,
724.47 but it's a construct, and
it's not what it seems, right.
729.99 But it's not that every use of
the term self is illegitimate.
734.43 And there are certain types of
selves that are not illusory.
737.58 I mean, I'm not saying
that people are illusions.
740.73 I'm not saying that you
can't talk about yourself
746.4 as distinct-- yourself
as the whole person
748.8 and with as
psychological continuity
751.53 with your past experience
as being distinct
755.01 from the person and
psychological continuity
757.74 of some other person, right.
758.907 I mean-- because
obviously, we have
760.365 to be able to
conserve those data.
762.09 It's not fundamentally
mysterious
764.04 that you're going
to wake up tomorrow
765.63 morning still being
psychologically continuous
768.09 with your past and
not my past, right.
770.22 And if we swapped lives, that
would demand some explanation.
776.92 So the illusorines
of the self doesn't
779.46 cut against any of
those obvious facts.
782.07 So the sense of self
that is illusory.
786.21 And again, we might want to
talk about self in other modes
788.85 because there's just
a lot of interest
791.85 there psychologically and
ultimately scientifically.
797.55 The thing that doesn't exist--
799.77 it certainly doesn't
exist as it seems
801.51 and I would want to argue
that it actually is just
803.61 a proper illusion,
is this the sense
808.75 that there is a subject
interior to experience
812.95 in addition to experience.
814.31 So most people feel
like they're having
816.58 an experience of the world.
817.847 And they're having their--
an experience of their bodies
820.18 in the world.
821.39 And in addition
to that, they feel
823.75 that they are a subject internal
to the body, very likely
828.37 in the head.
829.03 Most people feel like they're
behind their face as a kind
832.42 of locus of awareness and
thought and intention and that
837.4 every-- it's almost like
they're-- you're a passenger
840.01 inside your body.
841.24 You don't-- most people don't
feel identical to their bodies.
844.03 And they can
imagine this is sort
846.88 of the origin, the
psychological origin,
849.07 the folk psychological origin,
of a sense of that there
852.82 might be a soul that could
survive the death of the body.
855.28 I mean, most people are
what my friend Paul Blum
857.8 calls common sense do lists.
859.72 You-- you're just the
default expectation
863.8 seems to be that whatever the
relationship between the mind
867.43 and the body, there
is this-- there's
870.58 some promise of
separability there, right.
873.29 That the-- and whenever you
really push hard on the science
878.063 side and say, well, no,
no, the mind is really
879.98 just what the brain
is doing, that
882.05 begins to feel more and more
counterintuitive to people,
884.84 and there still seems
some residual mystery
887.93 that at death maybe something
is going to lift off the brain
892.06 and go elsewhere, right.
893.06 So there's this sense of
dualism that many people have.
896.33 And obviously, that's supported
by many religious beliefs.
901.61 But this feeling it is a
very peculiar starting point.
907.31 People feel that in a--
910.55 they don't feel identical
to their experience.
912.948 As a matter of experience,
they feel like they're
914.99 on the edge of experience.
917.6 Somehow appropriating
it from the side.
920.67 You kind of on the
edge of the world.
922.47 And the world is out there.
924.05 Your body is, in
some sense, an object
927.17 in the world which is
different from the world.
930.59 The boundary of your
skin is still meaningful.
933.38 You can sort of loosely
control your body.
936.65 I mean, you can't control it--
you can control your gross
939.08 and subtle voluntary
motor movements,
941.99 but you can't-- you're
not controlling everything
945.428 your body is doing.
946.22 You're not controlling
your heartbeat
947.762 and your hormonal
secretions and all of that.
951.925 And so there's a
lot that's going
953.3 on that is in the dark for you.
955.61 And then you give someone an
instruction to meditate, say.
961.53 And you say, OK, well,
let's examine all of this
963.53 from the first person side.
964.655 Let's look for this
thing you're calling I.
967.64 And again, I is not
identical to the body.
970.85 People feel like their
hands are out there.
972.642 And when-- if they're
going to meditate,
974.308 they're going to close
their eyes very likely.
976.225 And now they're going to
pay attention to something.
978.391 They're going to pay attention
to the breath or the sounds.
980.87 And it's from the point of view
of being a locus of attention
985.01 that is now aiming attention
strategically at an object,
988.17 like the breath, that there's
this dualism that is set up.
992.15 And ultimately, the ultimate
promise of meditation.
996.42 I mean, there are
really two levels
998.64 at which you could be
interested in meditation.
1002.21 One is very straightforward and
remedial and non paradoxical
1006.89 and very well subscribed.
1008.42 And it's the usual set of claims
about all the benefits you're
1012.262 going to get from meditation.
1013.47 So you're going to
lower your stress,
1014.66 and you're going to
increase your focus,
1016.46 and you're going to stave
off cortical thinning,
1018.83 and there's all
kinds of good things
1020.33 that science is saying
meditation will give you.
1025.77 And none of that entails
really drilling down
1028.77 on this paradoxical claim
that the self is an illusion
1031.17 or anything else of that sort.
1034.0 But from my point of
view, the real purpose
1037.2 of meditation and
its real promise
1038.819 is not in this long
list of benefits.
1042.45 And I'm not discounting
any of those
1044.67 though the science for many
of them is quite provisional.
1049.29 It's in this deeper claim that
if you look for this thing
1053.04 you're calling I. If
you look for the sense
1055.11 that there's a thinker
in addition to the mirror
1059.22 rising of the next thought,
say, you won't find that thing.
1063.34 And you can-- what's more,
you cannot find it in a way
1067.81 that's conclusive and
that matters, right.
1070.99 And it has-- there's
a host of benefits
1073.81 that follow from that
discovery which are quite
1079.98 a bit deeper and more
interesting than engaging
1082.62 meditation on the
side of its benefits.
1084.27 You know, de-stressing,
increasing focus,
1086.49 and all the rest.
1088.08 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have a
number of questions related--
1089.19 SAM HARRIS: Sure.
1089.4 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to
what you just said.
1091.108 And first of all, I agree that
the evidence that meditation
1095.19 can improve focus,
reduce stress, et cetera.
1097.08 It's there.
1097.71 It's not an enormous pile of
evidence, but it's growing.
1101.22 And--
1101.72 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1101.79 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --I
think that especially
1103.54 for some of the shorter
meditations, which
1105.36 I these days view more
as perceptual exercises.
1109.5 I've talked about this
in the podcast before.
1112.14 But for those who haven't heard
it before about perception.
1114.88 You can have extra perception
extending to things
1117.51 beyond the confines
of your skin.
1118.92 Interception, which
is, I think, also
1121.23 includes the surface of the
skin but everything inward.
1124.26 And meditation through eyes
closed typically involving
1128.82 some sort of attentional
spotlighting, something
1131.13 we'll get into more.
1133.08 Interior receptive versus
external receptive events,
1135.37 et cetera, including thoughts.
1137.16 And-- so I think of--
1139.47 at a basic level
meditation as somewhat
1142.08 of a perceptual exercise.
1144.69 You can tell me where
you disagree there,
1146.4 and I would expect and
hope that you would.
1148.755 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1149.756 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But I would
like to just touch on this idea
1152.256 that you brought up because
it's such an interesting one.
1154.631 Of this idea that our bodies
are containers and that
1157.17 we somehow view
ourselves as passengers
1160.02 within those containers.
1162.0 That's certainly
been my experience.
1164.37 And the image that
I have is of--
1167.68 as you say, that is
of myself or of people
1170.34 out there that sit a few
centimeters below the surface
1174.39 or that sit entirely
in their head.
1176.46 And, of course,
the brain and body
1178.59 are connected through
the nervous system.
1180.36 I think sometimes
a brain is used
1182.778 to replace a nervous
system, and that
1184.32 can get us into trouble
in terms of coming up
1186.33 with real directions
and definitions.
1188.49 But the point is that
there is something special
1192.193 about the real
estate in the head.
1193.61 I think for as much
as my laboratory,
1195.68 and many other scientists
are really interested
1198.08 in brain-body connections
through the nervous system
1200.54 and other organ systems that
the nervous system binds
1204.29 that if you cut
off all my limbs,
1207.2 I'm going to be different, but
I'm fundamentally still Andrew.
1210.14 SAM HARRIS: Right.
1210.89 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Whereas if we were
1212.348 to lesion a couple of
square millimeters out
1214.34 of my parietal cortex,
it's an open question
1217.4 as to whether or not I would
still seem as much like Andrew
1220.563 to other people and to myself--
1221.855 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1222.17 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --even.
1222.74 And so there is something
fundamentally different
1224.782 about the real estate
in the cranial vault.
1227.09 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1227.21 I mean, we are--
1227.45 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can
even remove both of my eyes,
1229.16 I'd still be Andrew.
1229.993 And those are two pieces of
my central nervous system
1232.49 that are fundamental to my
daily life, but I'd still be me.
1237.29 Whereas-- and this
doesn't, I think,
1239.78 just apply to memory systems.
1240.988 I mean, I think
there are regions
1242.363 of the frontal cortex
that, when destroyed,
1244.16 have been shown to modify
personality and self-perception
1247.88 in dramatic ways.
1249.15 So it's a sort of obvious
point once it's made,
1251.63 but I do think it's worth
highlighting because there
1254.465 does seem to be something
special about being
1256.34 in the head.
1256.88 The other thing is that
sitting a few centimeters
1262.2 below the surface or
riding in this container
1265.14 makes sense to me.
1266.4 Except I wonder if
you've ever experienced
1270.18 a shift as I have when
something very extreme happens.
1273.84 Let's use the negative
example of all of a sudden
1277.2 you're in a fear state.
1278.4 All of a sudden, it feels as
if your entire body is you
1282.03 or is me.
1283.53 And now I need to get this
thing-- the whole container
1286.68 and me to some place of
safety in whatever form.
1291.49 This is also true, I
think, in ecstatic states--
1293.73 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1294.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --where
you can feel really--
1294.84 when people say embodied,
I wonder whether or not
1297.09 we normally oscillate below
the surface of our body.
1299.445 When I say oscillate,
I mean in neural terms.
1301.32 I mean, maybe our
sensory experience
1303.18 is not truly at
the bodily surface
1305.52 but sits below the
bodily surface more
1307.847 at the level of organ
systems and within our head.
1309.93 And then certain
things that jolt us--
1312.3 our autonomic nervous system
into heightened states
1315.24 bring us into states of--
1317.616 bring us closer to the
surface and therefore include
1320.4 all of us.
1321.39 Again, I don't want to take us
down a mechanistic description
1324.48 of something that doesn't exist.
1326.19 But does any of that
resonate in terms
1328.8 of how you are thinking
about or describing the self?
1331.08 SAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah.
1332.13 There's a lot there.
1333.69 First, on the point of
the brain being the locus
1336.99 of what we are as minds.
1340.193 Yeah, I mean, there
are people who
1341.61 will insist that sort of
the whole nervous system
1345.21 has to be thought of as a--
1346.977 when you're talking
about our emotional life
1348.81 and the insulas
connection to the gut.
1355.38 And just the sense of self
extends beyond the brain.
1360.39 But I totally take your
point that a brain transplant
1364.23 is a coherent
idea, and you would
1366.33 expect to go with the brain
rather than with the viscera.
1369.12 And so, in that
sense, we really are
1372.72 the old philosophical
thought experiment
1375.09 of being a brain in a VAT.
1376.44 I mean, we essentially
are already--
1377.94 the VAT is our skull, and we're
virtually in that situation.
1383.003 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
A horrible movie.
1384.42 I'm sorry I can't
help but interrupt.
1385.485 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1385.65 ANDREW HUBERMAN: When
I was a teenager,
1387.42 my sister and I used
to go to the movies
1388.56 every once in a while,
and we'd trade off
1390.09 who could pick the movie.
1391.26 And she took me to see once
the movie Boxing Helena.
1394.537 SAM HARRIS: Oh yeah.
1395.37 ANDREW HUBERMAN: The
David Lynch film--
1396.69 SAM HARRIS: Which I
never saw that again.
1397.38 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--where he amputates
1398.31 the limbs of a woman who he's
obsessed by and keeps her.
1400.85 It's a really horrible--
1401.85 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1402.33 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --film.
1403.33 And about 20 minutes into it,
my sister just turned to me
1405.84 and said, I'm so sorry.
1407.402 And the question there
was whether or not
1409.11 two siblings should actually
persist in a movie like that.
1411.59 SAM HARRIS: Right.
1411.96 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And we
decided to persist in the movie
1413.46 so that we could
laugh about it later.
1415.44 But it was rather disturbing.
1416.793 I don't recommend the movie.
1417.96 Nor do I recommend
seeing it with a sibling.
1419.793 But in that movie, the woman,
he takes her as a container
1424.14 and restricts her movement.
1425.61 Quite sadistic and
horrible thing really.
1429.6 David Lynch, interesting
mind perhaps.
1432.96 But the idea was to question
how much of the person
1437.46 persists in the absence of their
ability to move, et cetera.
1440.13 Could there be love?
1441.03 Could there be these
other affections?
1443.55 Anyway, a rather
extreme example.
1445.26 But one that still haunts me.
1447.218 And I suppose I'm
thinking about still now.
1449.01 SAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah.
1449.7 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
1450.617 SAM HARRIS: Well, so just
to follow that point,
1454.5 there's a lot about us that we
don't have access to unless we
1460.05 enact it physically.
1461.22 Like if I ask you, do you
still know how to ride a bike?
1466.65 There's no place in
your memory where
1468.78 you can inspect but just
sitting in your chair
1472.32 that you've retained
the knowledge of how
1474.63 to ride a bike.
1475.662 Procedural memory
is different from
1477.12 semantic or episodic memory.
1478.35 If I asked you, do
you know your address?
1482.4 Yes, you can recall your
address just sitting there.
1485.73 But if you had had a micro
stroke that neatly dissected
1488.79 out your ability to
ride a bike and left
1491.49 everything else
intact, you might
1493.773 think you could ride a bike.
1494.94 But suddenly, you
stand up next to one.
1496.963 And you have no idea
what to do with it.
1498.63 And that would be
a discovery that
1500.047 would only happen if
you were motorically
1502.44 engaged with that object.
1506.01 And I'm sure we could
probably come up
1507.99 with 100 things about us
that really seem core to us
1511.53 and not separable from
our personhood which
1518.39 seemed to only get
invoked when we're
1521.78 out they're moving in the world,
and we have limbs, et cetera.
1529.53 No, it's the seat
of consciousness,
1536.948 the right framework
to talk about all
1538.49 of this, from my
point of view, is
1539.42 consciousness and its contents.
1541.018 So we have consciousness.
1542.06 The fact that there's something
that is like to be us,
1544.94 the fact that the world
and our internal experience
1549.35 is illuminated.
1550.79 It has a qualitative character.
1554.277 And then, there's
the question of what
1555.86 is that qualitative character?
1558.05 What kinds of information
do we have access to?
1560.33 What does it feel like to be us?
1561.95 How do different states
of arousal change that?
1565.88 So you talked about fear.
1566.96 Yeah, fear can change
a lot of things.
1571.58 And various neurological
deficits, or you
1574.64 can add drugs to the mix.
1575.85 You add psychedelics
that radically transform
1578.69 the contents of consciousness.
1580.31 From my point of
view, consciousness
1581.81 itself is simply the
cognizance, the awareness,
1586.79 that is the flood lights
by which any of that stuff
1591.14 appears.
1591.98 So consciousness doesn't change.
1596.33 But its contents change.
1598.01 And to come back to meditation
for a second, many people
1602.45 think meditation
is about changing
1604.61 the contents of consciousness.
1606.12 There are some contents you
want to get rid of like anxiety.
1609.29 Other contents you
want to encourage,
1611.57 like calm, and unconditional
love, or some other classically
1615.8 pleasant, prosocial emotion.
1618.74 And that's all fine.
1619.88 That's all possible.
1621.23 But the real wisdom of
the 2000-year-old wisdom
1627.35 of meditation that really is the
chewy center of the Tootsie Pop
1631.58 is a recognition of what
consciousness itself is always
1636.08 already like regardless
of the contents in it
1638.54 and the changes in contents.
1639.98 And this is why we
might talk about this.
1643.01 But this is why they're
mutually compatible.
1646.52 Psychedelics and meditation,
for me, are somewhat orthogonal.
1649.31 Because psychedelics is all
about making wholesale changes
1652.94 to the contents
of consciousness.
1654.32 And there's some wonderful
consequences of doing that.
1658.07 There can be some harrowing
and terrifying consequences
1660.677 of doing that.
1661.26 But generally speaking,
I think used wisely,
1665.137 they can be incredibly valuable.
1666.47 And the therapeutic
potential there is enormous.
1670.16 But the crucial disjunction
here is that there really
1675.56 is something to recognize about
ordinary waking consciousness,
1678.63 the consciousness that's
compatible with my driving
1681.08 a car to get here on time.
1683.15 You don't have to have the
pyrotechnics of being on LSD
1688.58 to see to transcend the
central illusion that I'm
1696.24 saying is the thing
to be transcended,
1698.19 which is the sense that there
is a duality between subject
1701.52 and object in every
moment of experience.
1704.94 And to take it back to something
you said about just all
1707.58 of our different modes
in ordinary life,
1710.13 the interesting thing is I
think people are constantly
1712.5 losing their sense of self.
1714.6 And they're not aware of it.
1715.92 And there's probably an
analogy to the visual system
1721.59 here, which is to visual
saccade, which perhaps you've
1726.6 spoken about at some
point on your podcast.
1728.55 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not enough.
1729.43 So please.
1729.98 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1730.71 So what happens every
time we move our eyes,
1733.35 this is called a saccade.
1734.73 And we do that about three times
a second or so just normally.
1739.89 There is the region
of motor cortex
1743.37 that affects that
movement sends what's
1746.55 called an efferent copy of
that motor movement, which
1752.43 is used as information
that propagates back
1755.04 to visual cortex, that
suppresses the data of vision
1759.39 while the eyes are moving.
1760.92 Because otherwise if
you weren't doing that,
1763.223 every time you
moved your eyes, it
1764.64 would seem like the visual scene
itself was lurching around.
1767.58 And people can experience
this for themselves
1769.83 if they just touch one of
their eyeballs on the side,
1773.22 not all that hard,
and kind of jiggle it.
1775.505 And then, you can
roll it around.
1776.88 You can jiggle it
from side to side.
1778.38 You can see a movement
of the eyeball that's
1783.39 not governed by your
oculomotor system
1786.06 delivers a jiggling
of the world.
1787.98 Because your brain is
not anticipating it
1790.163 in the same way.
1790.83 And you're not producing
that same predictive copy
1796.5 of the movement.
1797.86 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
a little bit like--
1800.447 we have some action sports
filmmakers on our staff
1802.53 here that the gimbal,
that holds an iPhone,
1805.66 like you see the
kids on surfboards
1807.183 or skateboards or something.
1808.35 They're going to hold a
phone while moving around
1810.392 or the people, the
vloggers-- does anyone
1812.49 even still use that for phrase?
1813.85 SAM HARRIS: I don't know.
1814.892 I guess.
1816.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Moving around
and it's image stabilization,
1818.73 essentially, that keeps
the camera steady.
1821.97 And these are more than
cameras, of course,
1824.647 for those listening,
point at my eyes.
1826.23 But they do far more than
just what a camera would do.
1828.48 But this internal system
of image stabilization, I
1832.5 can see perhaps where
you're going with this,
1835.29 that it allows us to remain in
a self-referencing scheme, as
1842.12 opposed to paying attention
to just how confusing it
1845.84 is to track the visual
world at some level.
1847.703 SAM HARRIS: Well, actually
where I'm going is,
1849.62 that people are having this
suppression of vision three
1854.75 times a second on average.
1856.58 And they're not experiencing it.
1858.83 You're effectively going blind.
1862.67 And you're not noticing it.
1865.897 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's very fast.
1867.23 SAM HARRIS: Yes, it's very fast.
1868.563 Now there's an analogous
suppression, I would say,
1875.45 of the sense of self that
occurs every time attention gets
1880.96 absorbed significantly
in its object.
1884.53 We even have this concept of
losing yourself in your work.
1889.81 Classic flow experiences
have this quality.
1893.86 And this tends to be why
they're so rewarding.
1898.09 If you're in some athletic
activity or an aesthetic one,
1905.29 or you could be having
sex, or whatever
1907.15 it is, some peak experience,
its peakness usually
1911.5 entails there being
some brief period
1915.01 where there was no distance
between you and the experience.
1919.462 For that moment,
you were no longer
1920.92 looking over your own shoulder
or anticipating the next moment
1925.09 or trying to get somewhere,
where you weren't,
1927.79 or micromanaging errors.
1932.44 There's just the flow of unity
with whatever the experience
1938.29 is, a surfer on the wave.
1941.89 And we love those experiences.
1944.78 And then we are continually
abstracted away from them
1950.77 by our thinking about them.
1952.477 We're thinking, oh my
god, that was so good,
1954.31 or how do I get back to that?
1955.518 Or you're looking at a sunset.
1957.22 It's the most beautiful
sunset you've ever seen.
1959.65 And then you're continually
interrupting the experience
1963.64 of merely seeing it with
a commentary about how
1967.21 amazing this is.
1968.05 And I wonder, what real
estate prices are here?
1970.54 I mean, is it possible
that I could move here.
1972.52 And your mind is just
continually narrating
1976.96 a conversation you're having
with yourself, however
1979.72 paradoxically.
1980.41 I mean, you're telling
yourself things
1982.93 that you already know as
though there are two of you
1986.5 rather often.
1988.96 I'm looking for--
which is the water.
1991.867 And it's, oh, there it is.
1992.95 But I'm the one seeing it.
1995.5 Who am I saying,
oh, there it is to.
1998.26 Is there someone else
who needs to be informed
2000.99 about the thing I already saw.
2003.66 So there's something about
our internal dialogue
2006.39 that is paradoxical.
2009.78 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there
any neurologic condition
2014.136 call it soulectomy or anything
like that where somehow people
2017.85 feel more unified with the
self on a continual basis,
2021.9 the observer and
the actor within?
2026.22 State more as a
complete sentence.
2029.25 Is there any known
neurological syndrome--
2032.697 makes it sound like a bad thing,
but it could be a good thing.
2035.28 --whereby people
feel that the actor
2038.25 and the observer within them
are unified continually?
2041.46 SAM HARRIS: There's
not a pathological one.
2043.38 Some the work on the
default-mode network
2045.9 suggests that that's at
least part of the story.
2049.03 So the default-mode
network, which
2052.98 has been talked about a
lot of late because it
2055.71 has come up both in the
meditation literature
2058.8 and in the psychedelic
literature.
2061.08 But its original discovery
was that-- and the reason
2065.4 why I was called the
default mode was is
2067.199 that in virtually every
neuroimaging experiment ever
2070.05 run, they found that between
tasks, when the brain was just
2074.37 in its default state, these
midline structures would
2078.81 increase their activity.
2080.76 And then they would
reliably diminish
2083.55 whenever the person in
the scanner was on task.
2087.96 And usually, that meant
some outward looking
2092.31 visual discrimination task.
2093.81 But it could be visual.
2095.73 It could be semantic.
2096.84 But it tends to be
their eyes are open.
2098.732 And they're paying
attention to something
2100.44 that's being broadcast to
them through monitor goggles,
2104.588 or they're looking at a mirror
that's showing them a computer
2107.13 monitor.
2108.97 But so the general
insight was, there
2112.17 are these midline
structures in the brain that
2114.12 seem to be increasing
their activity when
2118.38 the brain is idling
between tasks, waiting
2121.11 for something to happen.
2122.8 And then further
experiments found
2125.76 tasks that actually upregulated
activity there beyond baseline.
2131.73 And those tasks seem
to be self referential.
2135.87 So that when you ask people--
2137.38 you give them a list of words.
2138.63 And you say, well, do any
of these apply to you?
2143.25 Or you ask people
to think about--
2148.02 Actually, one experiment I did.
2149.43 When you're challenging
people's beliefs, when you're
2153.09 challenging beliefs
that have more
2155.37 of a personal significance, like
political or religious beliefs,
2158.64 you get an upregulation
in these regions
2160.65 as opposed to just generic
beliefs about you're
2163.92 in Los Angeles.
2164.92 This is a table.
2165.69 That is something to which
people are not holding fast
2169.92 as a matter of identity.
2173.65 So anyway, both meditation
and psychedelics
2177.9 seem to suppress activity
in these regions, which
2182.04 we know are associated with
both self-talk, mind-wandering,
2188.01 and explicit acts of
self representation.
2189.985 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Could we say that they
2191.61 are somewhat
autobiographical because they
2193.65 access memory systems?
2195.18 And in the way you're
describing them,
2197.803 and in the way that
a colleague of mine,
2199.47 who's been a guest
on this podcast--
2200.8 I don't know if you've
interacted with him before.
2202.14 But I think you'd very much
enjoy whatever interaction you
2205.11 would have. --is David Spiegel.
2206.85 He's our associate
chair of psychiatry.
2208.8 He and his father
actually-- his father
2210.66 then he founded hypnosis as
a valid clinical practice
2215.19 in psychiatry.
2215.85 And hypnosis, which is obviously
a heightened sense of attention
2218.97 with deep relaxation, is
known to dramatically suppress
2222.3 the default-mode network.
2224.337 He talks about this a lot.
2225.42 And I always wonder as
we take down activity
2230.55 within the default-mode
network, what what surfaces
2236.46 in its place, does that
somehow reflect that the two
2240.45 are normally in a push-pull?
2242.1 Because that's not
necessarily the case.
2244.14 When I fall asleep,
I can hallucinate.
2245.91 But that doesn't mean
that during the day,
2247.83 the fact that I'm
looking at objects
2249.63 is what's preventing
me from hallucinating.
2251.79 If I close my eyes,
I can get imagery.
2253.65 But there's this
different illusion,
2256.62 the illusion of antagonistic
circuitry sometimes.
2259.722 I don't want to
take us off course,
2261.18 but the default-mode network
seems to "want to be there,"
2265.715 quote, unquote.
2266.34 It seems to be fighting
for our attention,
2270.03 unless we give ourselves
a visual target,
2271.77 or an auditory target, or
some salient experience
2274.35 of some kind, it sounds like.
2275.82 And then, I'm surprised to
hear that meditation reduces
2280.41 activity in the default-mode
network at some level
2282.78 because meditation
to me oftentimes
2286.05 involves paying attention
to some perceptual target.
2290.55 Maybe you could
eventually explain
2292.98 as to how it might do
that or why it might.
2295.757 SAM HARRIS: And I don't
think it's the whole story
2297.84 because, obviously,
outward-going attention is
2301.66 not--
2305.08 even if you're having
the kind of egoic
2307.65 saccade that I'm talking about,
where you're actually not
2310.78 clearly aware of yourself.
2312.58 You're not clearly
defining yourself
2314.44 as separate from experience for
the moment of paying attention,
2319.21 so you are sort of losing
yourself in your work.
2321.25 That's not the same
thing as having
2322.93 the clear meditative insight of
selflessness that I'm claiming
2326.5 is the goal of meditation.
2329.41 But to wind back to the
original point I was making,
2333.28 and the reason why I drew the
analogy to visual saccades,
2337.3 I do think there's a continuous
interruption in our sense
2341.23 of self that goes unrecognized.
2347.19 But the conscious acquisition
of the understanding
2353.35 that the self is an illusion
is a different experience
2356.94 because you're then
focusing on this absence.
2361.2 Actually, there's
another analogy
2363.21 to the visual system
that applies here,
2366.61 which is to the optic
blind spot, which
2371.07 is a good analogy for
me because it cuts
2373.08 through a bunch of
false assumptions
2374.97 as to where you
would look for this
2377.7 or how this relates to
ordinary experience.
2381.0 So as many people know
that in both eyes we have
2384.96 what's called the
blind spot, which
2386.94 is a consequence of the
optic nerve transiting
2390.21 through the retina,
unlike cephalopods.
2393.93 I think cephalopods
have their optic nerve,
2397.95 as an omniscient being
would have engineered it,
2402.42 connecting the
retina from the back.
2404.52 And therefore, there
is no area of blindness
2408.083 associated with its transit
back through the retina.
2410.25 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But our
receptors are one the outside.
2411.99 SAM HARRIS: Exactly.
2412.77 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Humans, for whatever
2414.312 reason, put photoreceptors--
well, I always
2416.19 say I wasn't consulted
on the design phase.
2418.08 Something put photoreceptors,
combination of things,
2421.92 put photoreceptors in the back.
2423.27 And so you actually have to
send the highway of information
2426.3 through the pixel
center of the eye.
2430.45 Cephalopods and
drosophila, basically
2435.06 invertebrates, the design
is more at its face logical.
2440.4 Mammals, very illogical
design, at least as far
2443.97 as our judgments go.
2445.44 SAM HARRIS: But it
gives me a good analogy.
2447.25 So I'll take it.
2448.462 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like
to take a brief break
2450.42 and acknowledge our
sponsor, Athletic Greens.
2453.09 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
vitamin-mineral probiotic drink
2456.6 that also contains digestive
enzymes and adaptogens.
2459.69 I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012.
2462.87 So that's 10 years
now of taking Athletic
2464.85 Greens every single day.
2466.21 So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring this podcast.
2468.51 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens,
2470.4 and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens,
2472.41 is that it covers all of my
foundational nutritional needs.
2475.475 So whether or not
I'm eating well
2476.85 or enough or not, I'm sure that
I'm covering all of my needs
2479.88 for vitamins,
minerals, probiotics,
2481.8 adaptogens to combat stress.
2483.72 And the digestive enzymes
really help my digestion.
2486.42 I just feel much better when
I'm drinking Athletic Greens.
2488.928 If you'd like to
try Athletic Greens,
2490.47 you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman.
2493.26 And for the month
of January, they
2494.873 have a special
offer where they'll
2496.29 give you 10 free travel
packs, plus a year
2498.96 supply of vitamin D3, K2.
2500.91 Vitamin D3 and K2 are
vital for immune function,
2504.06 metabolic function,
hormone health,
2505.71 but also calcium regulation
and heart health.
2508.2 Again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman
2511.17 to claim their special offer in
the month of January of 10 free
2514.2 travel packs, plus a year
supply of vitamin D3 and K2.
2517.362 SAM HARRIS: So in
any case, we have
2518.82 this blind spot, which I
think most people learn
2523.41 this in school.
2524.58 Although, my daughters had not
been taught this in school.
2526.997 I just showed them this for
the first time a month ago.
2529.66 And they were
briefly fascinated.
2531.48 And then they went to
return to their screen time.
2534.0 But anyway, you can
take a piece of paper.
2536.58 And you make two marks on it.
2538.17 And then you cover one eye.
2539.7 And you fixate on one mark.
2543.162 I mean, you can
look this up online
2544.62 if you need details
about how to do this.
2546.93 And while staring at
one fixation point,
2550.38 you move the paper
back and forth.
2552.312 And you can get it
to a place where
2553.77 the other mark disappears.
2556.11 And you can run this
experiment long enough
2558.51 to satisfy yourself
that there is
2560.4 in fact a blind spot in
your visual field, which
2562.68 with one eye closed you
don't normally notice.
2566.7 The reason why you
have to cover one eye
2568.56 is because each eye
compensates for the blind spot
2571.05 of the other.
2572.97 Which is to say that
if you close one eye
2574.95 and survey the visual scene,
something really is missing,
2578.455 whatever you're looking at.
2579.58 If you're looking at
a crowd of people,
2581.205 somebody is missing a head
and you're not noticing it.
2583.68 And it's not easy to notice
because the brain doesn't
2589.68 tend to vividly represent
the absence of information.
2594.76 I mean, it's just part of the
game that's not being rendered.
2597.93 It's not showing up as a
break in the visual field.
2602.32 It's just not there.
2603.99 And I mean, people have
argued that there's
2607.02 a filling-in phenomenon
that happens,
2609.57 but I think that can be
misunderstood or exaggerated.
2612.947 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But the
eye movements themselves,
2615.03 that you described before--
2616.77 I guess, I should say
that the saccade analogy
2620.37 about transiently and
repetitively erasing the self
2624.78 works perfectly here because,
indeed, microsaccades,
2627.57 little smaller saccades, occur
all the time also prevent
2629.94 our eyes from fixating
in one location
2632.017 long enough to observe
our blind spot,
2633.6 even if one eye is closed.
2635.55 So if the experiment's done with
paralytics to essentially lock
2639.36 eyes at one location, basically,
things start disappearing.
2642.3 SAM HARRIS: It just fades away.
2642.81 ANDREW HUBERMAN: We
all love to think
2643.38 that we start hallucinating, but
actually, we start going blind.
2646.26 And those experiments
have been done on humans.
2648.6 I hear they're quite terrifying.
2650.832 SAM HARRIS: I mean, you can
do that for yourself too.
2653.04 It begins to just all
melt away in a warm glow.
2659.07 No psychedelics required.
2661.05 But the interesting
point there is
2664.56 that when you ask
yourself, OK, so
2667.62 because as a consequence
of the eyes' anatomy,
2670.26 there's this thing
you can see that is
2674.28 absent from your experience.
2676.92 But the question
is, where is that
2679.83 in relationship to the
rest of you, to your mind?
2683.29 Is that deep within?
2684.48 Or is that in some sense right
on the surface of experience?
2687.76 And there's expectation
that people have.
2691.31 Again, I think
conflating meditation
2694.01 with a search for changes in
the context of consciousness.
2697.49 They're looking for
much more subtle things
2701.84 to notice about the mind or
much vaster things to notice.
2707.03 Psychedelics sets
up this expectation
2709.88 that you do a massive
dose of mushrooms or LSD,
2714.11 and everything changes.
2716.15 I mean, you get this
full beatific vision.
2720.17 And you get not only visual
changes, but emotional changes.
2725.12 And you get synesthesia,
where you have
2729.26 much more mind in so many ways.
2733.8 So they begin having
these experiences,
2736.97 or reading the mystical
literature, you begin to think,
2739.35 OK, well, then freedom is really
elsewhere or it's deep within.
2745.1 It's not coincident with
the ordinary awareness
2750.32 that can see this
coffee cup clearly
2753.92 and that can just
transition attention
2755.69 to reading an email
with the full sobriety
2760.55 of ordinary waking
consciousness.
2764.63 But the truth is, this
insight into selflessness,
2767.39 this insight into the nonduality
of subject and object,
2770.93 is as close to ordinary
consciousness as this insight
2776.51 into the optic blind spot.
2778.13 Where do you have to
go to have this insight
2780.267 into the blind spot?
2781.1 you don't have to go anywhere.
2783.3 You just have to set up the
experiment correctly such
2786.29 that you can see the data.
2791.13 But the data is
right on the surface.
2792.81 It's almost too close
to you to notice.
2795.39 If it's at all hard
to notice, it's
2797.79 because it's so close,
rather than it's
2799.98 deep within or far away.
2802.18 And there are other
analogies like--
2804.973 I don't even remember.
2805.89 There's Mind's Eye,
pieces of artwork,
2807.81 that were the random
dot stereo grams, where
2810.43 we have an image that pops out.
2812.28 I always find it very difficult
to see those because I
2814.53 have a very dominant eye.
2816.39 But some people can see.
2817.44 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
People can't see those.
2819.107 These images that used to
be at the touristy shops.
2821.468 But people say, oh,
there it is, the whale.
2823.26 And I'm thinking,
I don't see it.
2826.11 Kids that swim a lot
when they're younger,
2828.75 and they tend to breathe
just to one side--
2831.202 I don't know if this was you.
2832.41 This was definitely me.
2833.368 They tend to keep
one eye closed.
2836.22 You set up a pretty
strong ocular dominance.
2838.74 Biasing your vision to one or
the other eye early in life,
2841.422 whether or not you're learning
how to be a bow hunter
2843.63 or you're learning how
to throw darts or shoot
2846.12 billiards or anything that,
involves selectively viewing
2850.253 the world through one eye
for even a couple of hours
2852.42 can set up a permanent
asymmetry in the weighting
2859.185 flow of visual information
from the eye to the brain.
2861.81 It's reversible, but only
through the reverse gymnastics
2864.48 of covering up the
other eye intentionally.
2866.43 So actually I had to be
reversed-patched for a while
2868.71 because I was seeing
double, because I
2869.85 lost binocular vision.
2870.9 I don't stand a chance in hell
of seeing an image pop out
2876.21 of a random dot
stereogram, which
2877.98 is kind of ironic because I did
my PhD on binocular circuitry.
2881.19 But nonetheless, if
people can see these,
2886.82 or if they can't, I
think they provide
2889.293 a really terrific
example of what you're
2890.96 talking about as a larger theme,
which is that perceptually you
2894.237 see a bunch of dots.
2895.07 And then all of a sudden,
what you thought wasn't there
2898.8 is suddenly there, but
can just disappear again.
2901.46 There are certain
visual illusions,
2903.05 if we were to include others,
that once you see them,
2905.51 you cannot unsee them.
2907.01 So there's the faces-vases,
figure-ground type stuff.
2911.96 SAM HARRIS: Bi-stable percepts.
2913.4 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Bi-stable percepts.
2914.9 And then there's sort
of ocular competition.
2917.42 You show two different images to
the eyes, each of the two eyes.
2920.48 And it is near
impossible for people
2923.18 to perceive them
both simultaneously.
2925.662 So it's a little bit of
what you're describing.
2927.62 I mean, these seem to
be fundamental features
2929.18 about the way the neural
circuits are organized,
2931.37 that they don't want to stay
fixated on any one thing
2935.6 for very long.
2936.26 To do so either takes training,
intense interest, intense fear,
2939.8 intense excitement.
2941.12 When I say intense, I guess,
I come back to this idea
2943.37 that the autonomic
nervous system is somehow
2945.203 governing our ability to
spotlight at any one location
2949.19 for very long.
2950.45 Is that a useful framework?
2951.93 Or is that going to take
us down a different path?
2953.61 SAM HARRIS: Well, it's sort
of a different path for this.
2955.985 I mean, the only
point I was making
2957.98 is that the
seemingly paradoxical
2961.01 claim that something can
be right on the surface
2964.25 and yet hard to see.
2969.8 And again, this seems to
justify the expectation held
2974.78 by, I would think,
the vast majority
2976.88 of people who get interested
in these spiritual things,
2980.75 for lack of a better word,
that the truth must somehow
2985.34 be deep within.
2988.13 There's some distance between
the one who is looking
2992.93 and the thing that
has to be found right
2995.06 and that you have to go through
this long evolution of changes.
2998.357 I mean, there are many
metaphors that set this up.
3000.44 It's like you're at
the base of a mountain,
3002.232 and you have to
climb to the top.
3004.1 And so you have
to find the path,
3006.2 however secure it
is to get you there.
3010.24 But there really is a distance
between your starting point
3014.11 and the goal.
3015.05 And what I'm arguing--
3017.29 and this is a kind of a nondual,
to use a term of jargon--
3023.83 this is a nondual
approach to meditation,
3027.04 as opposed to a dualistic one.
3029.44 The path and the
goal are coincident,
3034.42 that you have to unravel the
logic by which you would seek
3039.07 something that's outside
of the present moment's
3042.97 experience, i.e. not available,
really not available to you
3047.59 now.
3049.45 Because so many things
worth having, so many skills
3053.96 worth acquiring, really are
not available to you now.
3057.23 It's like if you
want to be a pianist,
3059.46 or if you want to
speak Chinese, there's
3062.42 something you don't know.
3063.807 And then you want
to learn that thing.
3065.39 And there's a whole process.
3067.07 And you might not be
capable of doing it.
3070.28 And real mastery is far away.
3073.07 If you've never hit
a golf ball, and you
3075.41 want to hit a golf ball
300 yards straight,
3078.747 I can pretty much
guarantee you're not
3080.33 going to do that initially.
3081.71 And you're not going
to do it on day two.
3084.02 And you're not going to do it
reliably for the longest time.
3087.23 And there's real
training in front of you
3090.26 to be able to do that reliably.
3094.26 An insight into, and
really the core insight,
3098.43 I mean, the insight that is the
core of the Buddha's teaching,
3101.88 to take one historical
example of this,
3107.44 really is available now.
3113.08 I mean, granted, it can be
very hard, one, for people.
3115.88 I mean, I had
probably spent a year
3118.39 on silent retreat in one week
to three month increments
3122.56 before I got the
point I'm making now.
3128.69 I mean, literally,
these are retreats
3131.39 where you spend 12 to 18
hours a day just meditating,
3135.59 trying to unpack the kinds
of claims I'm making now.
3143.3 So it's possible to
rigorously overlook this.
3147.78 It's possible to stand in
front of the mind's eye image
3150.8 and stare in a way
that is guaranteed
3153.86 not to give you
pop out and to be
3156.53 adept at staring in that way.
3159.84 So it's possible to be misled.
3161.42 And so what I'm
trying to argue here
3163.1 is that there's a fair
amount of leverage
3166.36 you can get with better
information, which
3169.03 can cut the time course of
your searching for this thing
3172.0 and cancel your false
expectations about just
3174.76 where this is in relation
to your ordinary waking
3177.64 consciousness.
3179.65 And it's possible to
get bad information
3182.5 and to have a bunch
of experiences.
3184.37 You go you go and do
an ayahuasca trip.
3187.3 And it's incredibly valuable.
3189.31 And it's valuable
for all the ways
3190.93 in which it changed the
contents of your consciousness
3193.24 in startling ways.
3194.98 And you had insights
into your past
3196.72 and into your relationships
and into why you're
3198.88 not as loving as you might be.
3200.38 And there's lots to think about.
3201.85 And you're like, OK,
that's all great.
3203.44 That's all something
that we can talk about.
3206.26 But it truly is orthogonal.
3210.13 I mean, it makes a
point of contact,
3211.63 or what I'm talking about,
it's really just at one point.
3214.36 And it's at the point
where this sense
3218.37 of subject-object
division in consciousness
3221.37 is illusory and vulnerable
to investigation.
3224.92 And if you investigate it as
the right plane of focus--
3229.26 you pick the analogy you
want, whether it's setting up
3233.43 the optic blind spot experiment
in just the right way,
3238.08 so that you can see that
the data is not there.
3244.02 I mean, the bi-stable percept is
great because when you see one
3248.76 of these images, like
the vase-face diagram,
3252.78 or the Dalmatian that it
looks like a mess of dots,
3256.2 and then you see the image
of a Dalmatian dog pop out--
3260.04 once you see it, you
really can't unsee it.
3263.44 I mean, once you have the
requisite conceptual anchor
3267.94 to it, then every time you look,
you're going to find it again.
3271.51 And eventually, it
becomes effortless.
3273.64 And that's what,
ultimately, meditation is,
3276.16 I mean, this kind of meditation.
3277.72 You ultimately
learn to recognize
3281.77 that there's no
separation between you
3284.59 and your experience.
3285.91 There's not the
experience on the one hand
3288.16 and the self on the other.
3290.5 There's just experience.
3292.54 There's just seeing, hearing,
smelling, tasting, touching,
3295.0 thinking, feeling,
proprioception,
3297.13 add whatever channels of
information you want to that.
3301.48 But there's just the totality
of the energy of consciousness
3308.07 and its contents.
3308.91 And it's not that
you're on the riverbank.
3313.83 And this is how it can
seem in the beginning,
3316.02 even when you're practicing
meditation fairly diligently.
3319.08 You can seem like
you're on the riverbank,
3321.0 watching the contents of
consciousness flow by.
3323.61 And meditation is the act
of doing that more and more
3328.59 dispassionately, so you're no
longer grabbing at the pleasant
3331.648 or pushing the unpleasant away.
3332.94 You're just kind of relaxing in
the most non-judgmental frame
3337.65 of mind, just
witnessing the flow.
3341.73 But if you're doing
that dualisticly,
3344.82 you feel like the meditator.
3346.32 You feel like the
subject aiming attention.
3348.58 And so now you're
on the riverbank
3350.07 watching everything go past.
3351.96 But the truth is,
you are the river.
3356.22 Experience itself is that there
is just experience itself.
3359.52 You're not on the
edge of experience.
3361.95 And everything you can
notice is part of the flow.
3367.02 And there's no point from
which to abstract yourself away
3371.04 from the flow to
stand outside it
3373.95 and to say, OK, this is my life.
3376.45 This is my experience.
3377.56 This is my body.
3378.54 Yes, you can do that.
3379.53 I mean, those are
all just thoughts.
3381.03 But that's more of the flow.
3382.65 And so there's a process by
which you would eventually
3386.79 recognize that there's
no distance between you
3390.66 and your experience.
3391.66 And again, you can wait
for those moments in life
3394.2 where experience gets so
good, or so terrifying,
3398.28 it's just so salient.
3400.56 Your amygdala is
driving so hard.
3402.66 I mean, so you're
in a war, and you
3404.67 can't think about anything
because the enemy is
3407.13 shooting at you.
3407.85 And this is the most
thrilling video game
3409.558 you've ever played in your life.
3410.97 And your life is on the line.
3412.41 Or you're at the peak
of some athletic event,
3417.27 where you don't know how you're
doing the things you're doing,
3421.32 but it's all happening
automatically.
3424.77 But those are 1/100
of 1% of one's life.
3431.31 And you know what I'm
calling meditation
3434.24 is a way of simply understanding
the mechanics of a tension
3439.38 whereby you are denying yourself
that unity of experience
3443.55 so much of the time and
recognizing that it's
3447.36 based on a misperception
of the way consciousness
3451.29 always already is.
3452.105 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, if
there wasn't an incentive
3454.23 to learn how to meditate
properly, that was one.
3460.63 And I've been meditating
for a fair amount
3463.24 since I was in my teens, but
more along the lines of paying
3466.45 attention to breath and
open-observer type meditation,
3473.26 or focused-attention.
3474.285 I would suppose more of
the focused-attention type.
3476.41 We'll get into these
a little bit later.
3477.61 But I have a number of questions
related to what you just said.
3480.235 SAM HARRIS: Sure.
3482.35 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love the idea
that this thing that we would
3487.69 all do well to understand to
observe consciousness of self
3492.43 as opposed to trying to alter
the contents of consciousness
3497.5 may sit much closer to
us than one might think.
3503.35 And because it sits
so close to us,
3506.22 that might be one of the
reasons why we miss it.
3508.5 I go right to a
visual system example.
3510.81 I mean, if you're
wearing corrective lenses
3513.58 and there's a
speck on your lens,
3515.13 typically you're looking
out through the lens,
3517.047 and so you wouldn't
observe that speck.
3518.91 Any number of different
analogies could work here.
3521.22 The fact that there
are states, however
3525.21 few, positive and negative,
extreme ecstasy and extreme
3530.91 fear being the two, I
think, most obvious ones
3533.85 that seems like
we agree on, that
3535.29 allow us to capture the
sense of completeness of self
3539.28 or the unity of the
observer and the actor.
3545.33 The fact that those are
seldom for the nontrained,
3548.81 for the nonmeditator,
suggests to me two things.
3552.44 I think one perhaps worth
exploring more than the other.
3555.56 But one is that what's really
being revealed in the states
3560.33 where we can feel the
unity of the observer
3562.28 and the actor is understanding
something fundamental
3565.67 about the algorithm, not
the online algorithm,
3568.535 but the algorithm that
is our nervous system.
3570.41 Just as you mentioned
cephalopods.
3572.24 I mean, mantis shrimp see an
enormous array of color hues
3575.75 that we don't.
3578.15 Their maps and
representations of the world
3579.95 are fundamentally different.
3581.117 Pit vipers see in the infrared.
3583.38 We're restricted to
somewhat of a limited range
3585.65 within the color
spectrum, but still more
3587.6 vast than that of dogs or cats.
3590.33 So understanding
that for seeing what
3594.04 a pit viper can see for
moments would be informative.
3598.7 Perhaps sensing-heat emissions
as a human might be invasive,
3604.097 maybe that's why we don't do it.
3605.43 So the question is, to just
make it straightforward,
3611.1 why would the system
be designed this way?
3614.07 Again, neither of us were
consulted in the design phase.
3616.472 But that brings me to, perhaps,
the more tractable question
3618.93 was, which is about development.
3622.29 I'm a great believer that the
neural circuits that encouraged
3627.51 healthy parent-child relations,
or unhealthy parent-child
3630.45 relations as the case
may be, in childhood stem
3632.82 from the initial
demands of internal
3635.282 versus external states, which
is exactly what we're talking
3637.74 about, which is that a young
child feels anxious because it
3640.59 needs his diaper change.
3641.59 It doesn't really know it needs
its diaper changed or it's cold
3644.55 or it's uncomfortable or it's
hungry or it's overly full.
3647.76 And so it vocalizes.
3649.052 And then some external
source comes to us
3650.76 and relieves that hopefully.
3652.552 And so the fundamental
rule that we first learn
3654.51 is not that we have a self or
that things fall down, not up.
3658.98 But it's that when
uncomfortable,
3663.15 externalize that discomfort.
3664.98 And it will be relieved
by an outside player.
3666.89 And then, of course, there's a
repurposing of that circuitry
3669.39 for adult romantic attachments.
3670.8 I don't think
anyone doubts that.
3672.63 And that can explain a lot
indeed about attachment
3675.16 and so forth.
3677.23 So something about our
developmental wiring
3680.4 and the algorithms that
these neural circuits run
3683.97 tend to bias most people,
the nonpractice meditators,
3688.14 to live a somewhat
functional life at least
3694.92 without this awareness
of actor and observer.
3698.64 And so what you're
really talking about
3700.65 is a deliberate intervention
to understand and resolve
3706.59 that gap in the algorithm.
3708.775 Do I have that right?
3709.65 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
3709.99 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I'm more or less
3710.58 restating what you said
in a way that, I'm hoping,
3712.8 will serve as a
jumping off point.
3714.84 Why questions are always very
dangerous in biology, or any.
3720.568 SAM HARRIS: Or in relationship.
3721.86 ANDREW HUBERMAN: What's that?
3722.37 SAM HARRIS: Or in relationship.
3723.18 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Or in relationship.
3723.93 Right.
3724.43 Exactly.
3725.038 Although, I think it all
does really hearken back
3727.08 to this early
developmental wiring which,
3728.61 of course, is modifiable.
3729.652 That's the beauty of
the nervous system is,
3732.42 it's the one organ that seems
to be able to change itself
3734.91 at least to some degree.
3738.71 So what are your thoughts
about the organization
3741.08 of the circuitry to essentially
under normal conditions to not
3744.89 reveal what seems to be one of
its more important and profound
3748.76 and, for dare I say,
enlightening features.
3753.92 It's almost as if we are
potentially like mantis shrimp.
3757.16 We can see so many more
colors than we actually see.
3761.18 And yet, we don't.
3764.54 Most people opt not to.
3766.68 And I would argue that
one of the great strengths
3770.57 of the Waking Up
app, for instance,
3772.49 is that it essentially walks
you through the process of being
3775.67 able to arrive at these
things without having
3778.16 to go to one-year or three-year
long silent meditation
3782.75 retreats.
3783.35 So if you could just elaborate
for a moment before we move on.
3786.08 What are your thoughts
about how the circuitry is
3788.18 arranged by default versus--
3790.64 and what that means for there
to be an intervention, that we
3795.5 have to intervene in the self
in order to reveal the self.
3798.71 SAM HARRIS: Well, so there
are two big questions there,
3801.603 one about evolution and
one about development.
3803.52 So with respect
to evolution, it's
3807.62 important to recognize
that evolution doesn't
3811.28 see our deepest concerns
about human flourishing
3815.06 and human well-being.
3816.08 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
all about the offspring.
3818.48 SAM HARRIS: We are set up
to spawn and to survive
3822.5 long enough to help our progeny
spawn if we can do that.
3827.21 And that's it.
3828.92 And so anything that was
good for that, including
3833.18 tribalism and xenophobia and all
kinds of hardware and software
3841.1 flaws that revealed
themselves to be flaws
3844.602 in the present time, when
we're trying to build
3846.56 a viable global civilization.
3848.78 But they redounded to the
advantage of our ancestors
3852.47 somehow, or there are things
about us that were simply not
3856.76 selected for, they
just came along
3858.32 for the ride, what Stephen
Jay Gould called a spandrel.
3863.63 So we are not set
up by evolution
3868.31 to be as happy as
we possibly can be
3872.99 and to do almost anything
that interests us well.
3877.01 I mean, we're not
set up by evolution
3878.75 to be mathematicians
or musicians
3881.66 or to create democracies
that are healthy.
3885.08 I mean, evolution
can see none of this.
3887.78 And we are doing
these things based
3891.17 on cognitive and
emotional hardware
3895.46 that we are leveraging
in new directions.
3898.49 I mean, we are primates.
3900.32 And we're communicating
with small mouth noises.
3903.807 I mean, we're
language-using primates.
3905.39 And all of that is
clearly evolved.
3909.36 And we're doing these amazing
things, including science.
3912.44 However improbably,
where we're actually
3914.96 able to, almost
entirely with language,
3920.75 understand reality
that at a scale
3924.2 that exceeds us in
both directions,
3926.12 I mean, the very vast and
the very small, and also
3929.42 temporally, the very old.
3931.43 We have visions
of the far future.
3933.56 We can figure out
where an asteroid
3936.14 is going to cross Earth's
orbit 1,000 years from now
3940.01 if we just do the math.
3941.09 And it's amazing that we
can do all of those things,
3943.257 but evolution is
blind to all of that.
3945.98 And so in terms of what we care
about and certainly in terms
3951.58 of what's going to ensure
our survival as a species,
3955.12 we have flown the perch that
was created for us by evolution.
3958.57 I mean, it's not just
the primate things.
3961.7 And so it is with learning
how to regulate our emotions
3966.22 and punch through
to a self concept
3970.09 or beyond a self
concept that is more
3972.52 normative, psychologically, that
allows us to not be terrorized
3978.1 by our ape-ish genes as
fully as we seem to be,
3982.78 even in the presence of more
and more destructive technology.
3986.35 I mean, we're still
practically chimpanzees armed
3990.85 with nuclear weapons.
3991.99 And that is increasingly
dysfunctional.
3994.6 And very soon we're going to
be in the presence of minds,
3998.89 or apparent minds,
that we have built
4001.02 that are as
intelligent as we are
4003.75 and very quickly, probably 15
minutes after that, far more
4006.99 intelligent than we are.
4008.14 And so what we do with all
of that is, again, something
4011.64 that we have to figure out
based on the minds we have,
4017.19 the minds we can build,
the minds we can change.
4021.0 We can meddle with
our own genomes now.
4022.95 And that will produce
its own consequences
4027.15 in ourselves and in
future generations
4030.66 if we meddle with the germline.
4032.28 And again, all of that
is just evolution.
4036.45 It's just sort of the
womb we came out of,
4038.31 but it didn't
anticipate any of that.
4042.93 Mother nature simply not had
our best interests at heart.
4046.5 And we might die off, and
from the point of view
4049.98 of mother nature that's fine
because 99% of every species
4054.18 dies off.
4058.0 So there's that.
4059.75 But when you're talking
about the individual,
4063.34 developmentally-- we all
come into this world,
4065.71 again, as a fairly
hairless primate
4070.3 that needs a tremendous
amount of care by others.
4072.82 And the logic of that is
that the reason why we're not
4080.32 a gazelle that can run 45
minutes later and then,
4083.83 basically, do all the
gazelle things perfectly soon
4087.91 thereafter.
4090.22 The reason why we have
this time of immaturity,
4097.3 and has become
functional for us,
4099.34 is that we're far
more flexible, and we
4103.06 can learn based on the needs
of an environment to do so much
4108.279 more than a gazelle can.
4109.81 And language is part of that.
4112.359 And in the last
10,000 years or so,
4118.02 culture increasingly has been
more and more a part of that.
4120.81 And there's probably a layer
at which we can plausibly
4123.479 talk about cultural evolution
and cultural evolution
4126.45 interacting with biological
evolution to change us.
4130.245 But when you're talking
about the development
4132.12 of an individual, each of us
comes into this world, I think,
4138.39 not recognizing
ourselves in any sense
4142.14 that would make sense to reify.
4146.937 I mean, it's not that
there's nothing there.
4148.77 I mean, there could be some kind
of proto-self differentiation.
4151.68 But I think it
takes a long while.
4155.399 And there is very
likely a coincidence
4159.0 between really
recognizing others.
4163.26 We recognize others first.
4165.24 certainly in
relationship immediately.
4166.95 And we orient to human faces.
4168.6 And we even detect other humans
as good and bad moral actors
4174.743 very early, I mean,
certainly long
4176.16 before we recognize
ourselves in a mirror.
4180.569 The experiments run, again, this
is Paul Blume and colleagues,
4184.71 experiments run on the
moral hardware and software
4189.12 of developing toddlers.
4191.723 But I think at
this point, they've
4193.14 pushed it down all the
way to six months of age,
4195.93 where you'll get these infants
staring at a puppet show.
4199.38 And they'll show
a greater interest
4204.49 in classically good actors
versus bad actors, cooperators
4208.68 versus defectors, in
various puppet show games.
4215.08 So it's not that we have no
mind and no proto-awareness
4221.08 of others and of self, but
what eventually happens,
4225.58 certainly as we become at
all facile with language use,
4230.98 is that we become aware
that not only are we
4235.33 in relationship to others,
but we are an object
4238.24 in the world for them.
4240.25 So we have enough people
pointing at us in our cribs
4244.87 and impinging upon
our experience.
4247.99 You're being physically moved,
and prodded, and touched,
4251.53 and consoled, or not consoled.
4254.08 And just imagine
what all of these--
4256.54 you're on the receiving end
of 10,000 interventions.
4260.77 And you're completely
helpless for the longest time.
4264.19 And all of that
attention, you have
4266.38 all of these people
coming up to the crib
4268.87 and making faces at you--
4270.183 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Cheering for you.
4271.6 SAM HARRIS: And it's
all pointed at you.
4274.15 There's a classic
magical narcissism
4278.38 that gets constructed
there if you
4281.65 take the psychological
literature, at least
4284.68 a certain strand
of it, seriously.
4287.26 And I think it's largely apt
to think of a child at that age
4293.44 as a kind of--
4298.46 there is a kind of
narcissistic structure
4300.98 there, where it's all
kind of going inward.
4304.19 And at a certain point
you realize, OK, I'm
4308.9 the center of all of this.
4311.03 It's not just a movie where
you're completely absorbed in,
4318.14 and you've lost
your sense of self.
4320.0 I mean, to talk to yet
another example of what
4325.237 it's like as a grown up
to lose our sense of self.
4327.32 And one of the things I
think we find so fascinating
4330.5 about television and film
is that when we get totally
4333.77 absorbed in it, we're in this
very unusual circumstance where
4337.67 our brain is
basically reading it
4340.52 as we're in the classic
social circumstance.
4343.28 We're presented with the facial
displays of other people.
4347.91 In fact, sometimes these
people are 10 feet tall
4351.62 or their faces are 10 feet tall.
4353.3 You have a close-up
in a movie theater.
4355.2 So it's like a super stimulus,
in terms of evolution.
4359.51 And they can be making direct
eye contact with a camera,
4363.89 so you have this gigantic
face staring at you.
4366.53 And yet, you're totally
uncomplicated socially.
4368.87 You can't be seen.
4370.25 And something you know
you can't be seen.
4372.78 And so you completely
lose self consciousness.
4377.0 And yet, you're able to examine
with completely free attention,
4381.77 again, because you're
totally unimplicated,
4384.98 the facial minutia and the
mimetic facial play of people
4391.55 at a very close range.
4394.25 I mean, you have physically
just about to kiss your spouse,
4400.97 like that's what a
close-up is in a film.
4403.89 You never get that
close to people.
4406.52 And yet, here you're
in a situation
4408.68 where you're unobserved.
4409.74 And you know that.
4410.49 And so I mean, this
is a bit of a tangent,
4412.91 but it's the other side
of what's happening
4415.34 developmentally for a kid.
4418.97 When you're in a movie
theater watching a movie,
4421.19 you are truly invisible.
4422.99 And yet, you're right there.
4425.99 However harrowing
the human drama
4428.66 is, you're seeing it play out.
4430.22 And you're seeing it up close.
4432.02 And it is, in principle,
a social encounter
4435.35 that your genes are ready
for, but they're not ready
4438.23 for you to be invisible.
4439.46 And so that's what's
so magical about it.
4442.77 But what happens developmentally
for a kid is that you're not
4445.82 invisible, you are an
object that is constantly
4448.4 being overrun, the boundaries
of your sensory engagement
4455.12 with the world are constantly
being impinged upon by others.
4458.12 And at a certain point,
you recognize, OK, I'm
4461.78 at the center of this.
4462.89 And the way this gets
enshrined as a self, I think
4468.83 is probably coincident
with our learning
4472.43 the language game we
learn to play with others.
4475.97 We're talking to others.
4477.11 People are talking to us.
4478.4 And at a certain point,
we're talking to ourselves,
4482.33 even when the other
people leave the room.
4484.76 And you can hear it.
4485.66 If you ever have
been with a toddler
4487.37 when they're externalizing
their self-talk,
4491.87 you hear them talking
to themselves.
4493.46 They're playing.
4494.127 And they're having
a conversation.
4496.11 They were talking
to you, the parent.
4498.02 But then you left the room,
and they're still talking.
4500.33 You come back in, and
they're still talking.
4502.49 And what happens
to us, strangely,
4507.72 and this comes back to
the logic of evolution,
4512.17 we never stop because
evolution never
4515.95 thought to build us an
off-switch for this.
4518.2 I mean, language is so useful.
4520.69 And it gets tuned up
so strongly for us.
4524.26 And there was never a
reason to shut it off.
4526.178 There was never a reason
to give you this ability
4528.22 to say, oh, wouldn't it be nice
to have four hours of quiet
4530.95 now, like no self-talk.
4533.32 And so for most of
us, I mean, I think
4535.0 there are people who, for
whatever neurological reason
4537.88 or idiosyncratic reason,
undoubtedly there'd
4541.39 be a neurological reason for
it, don't have any self-talk.
4546.13 But for most of
us, we are covertly
4550.36 talking basically all the time.
4553.36 And there's an
imagistic component
4556.11 of this for many people.
4557.11 You're visualizing
things as well.
4558.64 But there's just a ton of
white noise in the mind that
4565.06 feels a certain way.
4566.5 And what you discover
in meditation,
4569.77 ultimately, is that
the self is what
4574.23 it feels like to be
thinking without knowing
4576.54 that you're thinking.
4577.64 A thought arises uninspected
and seems to just become you.
4582.72 Like you and I are talking now.
4584.25 And people are listening to us.
4587.09 They're struggling to follow
the train of this conversation
4590.45 because it is competing
with the conversation that's
4593.0 happening in their heads.
4594.47 So I'll be saying something.
4595.97 And a person listening will
say, well, what does that mean?
4600.95 Or like, oh, but wait a minute,
he just contradicted himself.
4604.52 And there's a voice
in your head that
4606.35 is also vying for your
attention much of the time.
4611.51 So the first discovery
people make in meditation
4614.63 is that it's just so
hard to pay attention
4616.61 to anything, the breath,
or a mantra, or a sound,
4619.76 whatever it is, because
you're thinking.
4624.273 You're thinking about the thing
you need to do in an hour.
4626.69 And oh, it's so good that
I downloaded this app.
4628.927 This is really good.
4629.76 This is going to be good for me.
4631.093 But that chatter
isn't showing up.
4635.0 You're not far back enough in
the theater of consciousness,
4641.28 so as to see it emerge.
4642.71 It is just sneaking
up behind you.
4644.87 And it feels like me again.
4646.88 It feels like when someone is
thinking the thought, well,
4650.76 what the hell does that mean?
4652.67 They're not seeing
it as an emerging
4655.07 object in consciousness.
4656.39 It just feels like me.
4661.76 Subjectively, is like
the mind contracts
4665.06 around this appearance
in consciousness.
4668.33 And it really is just a sound
with the voice of the mind.
4672.56 If you actually can inspect
it, it is deeply inscrutable
4677.78 that we ever feel identified
with our thoughts.
4680.03 I mean, how is it that
we could be a thought?
4683.42 A thought just arises
and passes away.
4685.31 And when you inspect it,
when you go to inspect it,
4689.94 it unravels.
4692.07 It's the least substantial
possible thing.
4697.11 But yet, it could be a
thought of self-hatred.
4701.37 It could be a thought,
that unrecognized,
4704.88 totally defines your mood.
4711.47 I mean, again, this all
can seem kind of abstract.
4714.777 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, no, but I think
4716.36 it's extremely concrete
from the perspective
4718.82 of the neural circuits
that will return
4720.62 to maybe in a few minutes.
4722.31 I'd like to take a
brief break and thank
4724.61 our sponsor Inside Tracker.
4726.86 Inside Tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
4729.5 that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA
4731.96 to help me better
understand your body
4733.67 and help you reach
your health goals.
4735.47 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
4738.08 for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact
4741.032 your immediate and
long term health
4742.49 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
4745.025 The problem with a lot
of blood and DNA tests
4746.9 out there. however,
is that you get data
4748.85 back about metabolic factors,
lipids, and hormones,
4751.39 and so forth, but you don't
know what to do with those data.
4753.89 Inside Tracker
solves that problem
4755.87 and makes it very easy
for you to understand
4758.06 what sorts of nutritional,
behavioral, maybe even
4761.66 supplementation-based
interventions,
4763.94 you might want to
take on in order
4765.62 to adjust the numbers of those
metabolic factors, hormones,
4768.29 lipids, and other
things that impact
4770.0 your immediate and long-term
health to bring those numbers
4772.73 into the ranges
that are appropriate
4774.53 and indeed optimal for you.

4786.83 If you could elaborate a bit on
this notion of internal chatter
4790.37 and external stimuli and
the bridge between them
4794.03 because I think for some
people that might be intuitive.
4797.39 I think for others,
it's not so obvious
4802.34 that language is
ongoing in the backdrop.
4808.738 And then sometimes, I
think some people are
4810.53 more tuned into that language.
4814.28 For some people,
it's louder volume.
4816.02 For some people,
it's more structured.
4819.612 I have a colleague
at Stanford who's
4822.77 been on this podcast
called Deisseroth.
4824.54 He's one of, like, the
preeminent bioengineers.
4826.19 He's also a psychiatrist.
4827.232 And he has a--
4827.96 he doesn't call it a
meditative practice,
4829.44 but he has a practice
where each evening,
4831.148 after his five kids are put
down to sleep, you know--
4834.27 they're older now--
4837.02 and in the quiet of the
late hours of the night,
4841.44 early morning, he
sits and forces
4843.11 himself to think in
complete sentences,
4844.91 with punctuation, for an hour.
4847.118 This is the way that he has
taught himself to structure
4849.41 his thinking, because of
the very fact that you're
4851.99 describing, which is
that ordinarily, there
4854.06 is an underlying structure
to what's internal,
4856.49 but it's disrupted by external
events, And these are--
4860.36 typically, it's
not coherent enough
4863.24 to really make meaning from.
4865.012 So it's almost like
somebody sitting down
4866.72 to write in complete
sentences, but forcing
4868.512 himself to do it in his head.
4870.11 But for many people,
including myself,
4872.06 that's a foreign experience.
4873.98 And we only experience structure
through our interactions
4877.34 with the world and other people.
4879.95 I've taken the time to try and
explore ideas with eyes closed.
4884.48 And I've been able to do that.
4886.827 There are certain
pharmacologic states
4888.41 that we could talk about
that facilitate that.
4890.63 And no, those are
not amphetamines.
4892.31 Those do exactly the
opposite, by the way.
4894.98 But I think people
exist in varying degrees
4900.5 of structured and unstructured
internal dialogue,
4904.58 and in varying
depths of recognition
4908.81 of that internal dialogue.
4910.53 And so the question,
I suppose, is,
4912.5 just the recognition that
there's a dialogue ongoing,
4915.89 internally-- is that,
itself, valuable?
4918.122 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
4918.83 And that also can
take some time.
4921.02 So, I mean, here's
a claim I would
4922.97 make that some people
might find surprising.
4925.91 But I think this is an
objectively true claim about
4931.16 the subjectivity of most people,
which is that unless you have
4935.872 a fair amount of training--
let's say you just happen to be
4938.33 some kind of savant in this
area, which most people,
4940.91 by definition, aren't, or
you have a remarkable amount
4944.15 of training in what's called
concentration practice
4947.63 in meditation--
4950.21 I believe this is a true claim--
that if we just put a stopwatch
4955.16 on this table, and people
could just watch it 30 seconds
4959.48 elapse, and I set all of our
listeners, or your viewers,
4965.9 the task, for the
next 30 seconds,
4969.99 just pay attention to anything--
your breath, you know,
4973.07 or the sight of your hand,
or the sight of the clock,
4976.94 or any object--
4979.55 without getting lost in thought,
without getting momentarily
4982.82 distracted by this conversation
you're having with yourself.
4990.027 A couple of things would happen.
4991.36 One is no one would be
able to do it, right?
4994.5 And this is not just a
superficial inability.
5000.26 I mean, if your
life depended on it,
5002.01 you wouldn't be able to do it.
5003.26 I mean, if the fate of
civilization depended on it,
5005.96 none of our listeners
would be able to do this.
5010.46 And yet, some percentage of them
are so distracted by thought
5016.22 that they will actually
try this experiment
5018.98 and think they succeeded.
5020.022 Right?
5020.522 And for these people,
what happens is
5022.07 you put them on a
meditation retreat,
5024.02 and you have them
spend 12 hours a day
5026.36 in silence, doing
nothing but this.
5028.04 Right?
5028.54 So the practice is just
pay attention to the breath
5031.04 when they're sitting,
and then eventually, you
5033.05 incorporate everything--
sounds and other sensations.
5035.33 And then you interleave that
with walking meditation, where
5037.893 they're paying attention just
to the sensations of lifting
5040.31 and moving and
placing their feet.
5041.96 And then once the
practice is going,
5044.24 you incorporate sounds
and sights and everything.
5046.76 So you can pay
attention to everything,
5048.385 but the goal is,
for every moment,
5052.81 you are going to cultivate
this faculty of mind,
5056.47 which increasingly is
known as mindfulness.
5059.09 Right?
5059.59 And mindfulness is nothing
other than this very careful
5063.34 attention to the contents
of consciousness.
5066.49 But the crucial
piece is it is not
5071.11 a moment of being
lost in thought.
5072.83 Right?
5073.33 You're not blocking thoughts.
5075.55 Thoughts themselves can arise.
5076.93 But in those moments
of being truly mindful,
5079.21 you're noticing
thoughts as thoughts.
5081.43 Whether it's language
in the mind or images,
5084.28 you're noticing those, too,
as spontaneous appearances
5087.49 in consciousness.
5089.74 So if most people-- you know,
certainly anyone who thinks
5095.46 they can pay attention to--
5097.83 who can do the experiment
successfully that I just
5100.86 suggested-- pay attention
to something for 30 seconds
5103.23 without being lost in thought--
5105.06 you put those people on a
meditation retreat, what
5107.94 they're going to experience
is, you know, on the first day,
5111.33 they're going to
feel, like, oh, yeah.
5113.07 I was with the breath, or
I was walking-- you know,
5114.75 I was with the
sensations of walking--
5116.49 and I'd be there for, like,
five minutes solid, and then
5119.353 I would get lost in thought.
5120.52 And then I'd come back.
5121.44 And then five more minutes,
I'd be lost in thought,
5123.15 and then get back.
5123.93 But as the days progressed--
5126.78 even, you know, 10 days in to
a silent meditation retreat--
5130.11 they're going to experience
more and more distraction.
5134.19 It's going to seem
like, OK, wait a minute.
5136.83 Now I can't pay
attention to anything
5139.08 for more than 5 seconds.
5140.94 Right?
5141.81 That is progress, right?
5143.31 Because what they're discovering
is just how distractible
5147.06 they are.
5147.6 Right?
5148.1 And you know, for
some people, that
5151.593 will be immediately obvious.
5152.76 For some people, it'll
actually take a lot of practice
5155.22 to realize just how
distracted they are.
5157.523 ANDREW HUBERMAN: What you
just said, which was that,
5159.69 at some point, we can start
noticing our thoughts--
5167.05 I can notice my thoughts--
but what you're talking about,
5169.72 as a goal state, is not
being distracted by thoughts,
5174.76 but actually seeing
the relationship
5176.26 between thoughts, self, and
other types of perceptions.
5179.11 And here, I think recognizing
and seeing thoughts
5182.71 is a form of perception.
5184.0 It's just an
internally-directed perception.
5187.42 This raises a topic that
I'm also obsessed by,
5192.25 which I think neuroscience
can somewhat explain,
5194.62 but still incompletely--
5198.16 that the circuits and
mechanics, et cetera,
5200.65 are not yet known-- which
is about time perception.
5204.61 And you know, a
simple analogy would
5209.65 be that there are a lot of
small objects flying around
5213.545 in the space that we happen
to be having this discussion,
5215.92 but they're moving so fast
that I can't perceive them.
5218.44 Or they're entirely stationary,
so I can't perceive them
5220.93 because of the reasons
we talked about
5222.513 before in the visual system.
5223.72 My eyes are moving
in perfect concert
5225.58 with these small
object movements,
5228.52 and therefore, I
am blind to them.
5231.85 SAM HARRIS: Right.
5233.58 ANDREW HUBERMAN: A slight
shift in time perception--
5237.06 think of this, perhaps, as
a change in the frame rate,
5241.0 right?
5241.5 Camera frame rates.
5242.34 A faster frame rate, you
can capture slow motion.
5244.897 Slower frame rate,
you're going to get
5246.48 more of a strobe-type effect if
the frame rate is low enough.
5249.18 SAM HARRIS: Right.
5249.93 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right?
5252.18 Could it be that our time
perception is not one thing,
5257.42 but we have one rate of
perceiving time for external
5260.63 objects at a given distance--
which we know is true--
5263.22 another frame rate for
objects that are up close-- we
5266.39 know this to be true, even
if those objects are moving
5268.64 at the exact same speed, right?
5270.05 I mean, this would be
the sitting on a train,
5271.25 the rungs on the fence seem to
be going by very, very fast,
5274.17 but the ones in the distance
seem to be moving slowly.
5276.45 This is the way the visual
system and time perception
5279.02 interconnect at some level.
5281.638 You're up on a skyscraper--
the little ants
5283.43 of cars and people down below.
5286.097 You know they're moving
much faster than you
5287.93 perceive them to move, but
it's a distance effect.
5290.36 SAM HARRIS: I mean,
you see a plane,
5291.86 it's going to be going
300 miles an hour.
5293.3 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.
5293.78 SAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5294.02 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And it's not because
5295.07 of the lack of resolution.
5296.21 The lack of resolution
is incidental.
5298.94 We know this because in
animals, such as hawks,
5302.18 that have twice the degree
of acuity, as far as we know,
5305.54 they have the same
distance-associated shifts
5309.35 in time perception.
5310.79 So could it be
that we are running
5312.44 multiple streams of time
perception, multiple cones
5315.89 of attention, that include cones
of attention to our thoughts,
5318.89 and that somehow,
through meditation,
5320.6 we start to align the frame
rate for these different streams
5323.69 of attention so that they
all fall into the same movie,
5329.12 if you will--
although it's not just
5330.62 a movie with visual content.
5332.12 What I'm doing here
is clearly, I'm
5334.1 becoming a lumper
rather than a spreader.
5335.99 I'm sure this violates certain
rules of time perception
5338.675 and neural circuitry,
but I'm not sure
5340.85 that it's entirely
untrue, either.
5344.06 And does it survive at
all, as a possible model
5348.035 for what you're describing?
5349.16 And if the answer
is no, I'm perfectly
5350.743 comfortable with that.
5352.44 SAM HARRIS: Well, it's dependent
on what you mean by meditation.
5359.64 This is where, sort
of, the particularities
5361.44 of what one is doing
with one's attention
5363.75 under the frame of
meditation really
5366.66 matter, because there are
ways to practice mindfulness,
5370.83 in particular, where
the frame rate really
5374.04 does seem to go way, way up.
5375.61 Right?
5376.11 And there's actually been
some research done on this,
5378.69 where you take people before
and after a three-month silent
5382.38 meditation retreat, and you
give them some kind of visual
5386.07 discrimination task where
they have to detect--
5390.39 I think they used
a tachistoscope.
5393.69 Is that the tool for?
5394.913 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I'm not familiar.
5396.33 SAM HARRIS: Something
that presents, you know,
5398.986 very quick pulses of light.
5400.86 And in any case, just
in any sensory channel,
5407.263 I would imagine you can make
finer-grained discriminations
5409.68 if you're practicing mindfulness
in a very specific way, which
5413.34 is to be making these
fine-grained discriminations
5416.43 more and more, and do nothing
else for three months, which
5420.362 is a way of practicing.
5421.32 So the classic
mindfulness practice
5425.49 in what's called
Vipassana meditation
5428.91 is to pay scrupulous attention
to seeing, hearing, smelling,
5434.62 tasting, touching in a way
that breaks everything down
5440.19 into these kind of
microscopic sensory moments.
5444.27 So you know, rather than feel
your hands pressing together,
5450.9 what you're trying to
feel with your attention
5452.91 and you're feeling
more and more is
5454.83 all of the sensations of
pressure and temperature
5458.7 and movement such that
the feeling of hands
5463.44 completely disappears.
5464.46 You realize that a
hand is a concept,
5466.2 and all you have is this cloud
of punctate and very brief
5471.66 sensations.
5472.45 And so anything you think you
have as a datum of experience,
5477.87 as you bore into it
with your attention,
5482.21 it resolves into this kind of
diaphanous cloud of changing
5489.35 sensation.
5489.98 And that can be even something
as captivating as, like,
5495.64 a serious pain in your body.
5497.53 I mean, you can have could have
injured your neck, you know?
5500.65 And so you have some
excruciating pain in your neck.
5503.08 If you just are willing to
pay attention to it, you know,
5505.735 and just pay 100% attention to
it, a couple of things happen.
5510.98 One is your resistance
to feeling it goes away,
5514.39 by definition, because now your
goal is to just pay attention
5517.03 to it.
5517.53 And you recognize that so much
of the suffering associated
5520.93 with the pain was borne of
the resistance to feeling it.
5524.2 You're bracing against it and
all of your thinking about it,
5527.06 you know?
5527.56 You're thinking,
like, well, you know,
5529.143 why did I do this to
myself, or should I
5530.92 see an orthopedist, or how
long is this going to last?
5533.59 And maybe I herniated a disk.
5536.65 Like, all of that self-talk
is producing anxiety.
5539.59 And I'm not saying there's never
anything to think about there.
5542.29 But either you can do something
about it in the moment or you
5545.54 can't.
5546.04 And so much of our suffering
in the presence of pain is
5550.36 the result of resisting it,
worrying about it, thinking--
5554.05 just all of the--
5555.28 everything we're
doing with our minds,
5556.93 but just feeling it, right?
5560.47 So when you just
feel it, again, it
5564.22 breaks apart into this
ever shifting collection
5570.67 of different sensations.
5572.26 And it's not one thing, and
it never stays the same.
5576.88 So two things happen there.
5578.51 One is there can be a
tremendous amount of relief that
5581.38 happens there where you can
achieve a level of equanimity,
5585.7 even in the presence of really
unpleasant physical sensation.
5591.08 And this is true of
mental sensation as well.
5593.05 As it's true of emotions.
5594.16 The classically
negative emotions
5596.05 like anger, depression, or fear.
5599.11 The moment you become
willing to just feel them
5601.45 in all of their punctate
and changeable qualities,
5608.65 they cease to be what
they were a moment ago.
5613.15 When you're talking
about emotional states,
5615.91 they cease to map back on
to you and your self concept
5619.33 as meaningful in the same way.
5620.99 So that suddenly, the
anxiety you feel, let's say,
5624.58 before going out on stage to
give a talk, a moment ago,
5630.07 it had psychological meaning,
it felt like, I'm anxious.
5633.7 How do I get rid of this?
5634.87 Why am I this sort of person?
5636.23 Should I have taken
a beta blocker?
5638.29 This is the conversation
you're having with yourself.
5641.275 The moment you just
become willing to feel it
5643.15 as the pure energy of the
physiology of cortisol release,
5649.2 it ceases to have any meaning.
5652.17 It ceases to be a
problem in that moment,
5654.72 because it's no more--
5656.1 it no more maps onto
the kind of person
5658.02 you are then a feeling
of indigestion or a pain
5662.04 in your knee maps onto the
kind of person you are.
5665.565 It's just sensation, anyway.
5668.483 Back to the main
point here, which
5669.9 is that, if you train
your attention in this way
5673.47 to notice the particularities
of sensory experience
5677.97 and emotional experience,
you're looking
5679.83 for the atoms of experience.
5683.57 You get better and better at
that and certain things happen.
5688.72 But one thing that I
really do think happens
5692.46 is there's a kind of frame
rate change in the data stream
5697.89 where you really are just--
you're just noticing much,
5700.3 much more.
5702.9 All of that is a very
interesting way of training.
5705.51 It's not what I tend
to recommend now.
5708.06 It's a great
preliminary practice
5709.95 for what I do recommend,
because it really
5713.94 teaches you the difference
between being lost in thought
5716.34 and not, it really teaches
you what mindfulness is.
5718.95 But it tends to be done by 99.9%
of people in a dualistic way,
5728.25 which, again, you're set
up to think, OK, I'm over
5731.37 here as the locus of attention.
5734.1 And I'm continually getting
distracted by thought.
5736.65 And the project is to not
do that anymore and actually
5739.47 pay attention to the breath
and sounds and sensations.
5744.54 And every time I
get lost in thought,
5746.25 I'm going to go back here.
5747.333 But this whole dance
of I'm lost in thought,
5752.28 now I'm strategically directing
my attention again, all of this
5756.29 seems to ramify
this sense of self.
5758.54 The of there's one
to be doing this.
5761.39 There's somebody holding
the spotlight of attention
5764.18 and getting better
at coming back
5766.64 to the object of meditation.
5770.0 Again, it's inevitable
that 99.9% of people
5773.775 are going to start
there and stay there
5775.4 for some considerable
period of time.
5777.45 But the thing I like to do
when I talk about all of this
5781.91 is undercut the false
assumptions that are anchoring
5785.54 all of that as
early as possible,
5787.55 because where, I
think, you want to be
5790.76 is recognizing that there
is no place from which
5794.75 to aim attention.
5796.22 This whole dualistic setup
of subject and object
5799.13 is the thing that is
already not there.
5801.56 And it's not that it's there
and you meditate it out
5804.8 of existence successfully.
5806.45 It's really not there.
5808.13 And if you learn
how to look for it,
5810.38 you can see that it's not there
and feel that it's not there.
5813.14 And it no longer
seems to be there.
5815.36 It's like it's not--
5816.83 and it becomes like, again,
like a bi-stable percept where
5819.785 you looked at it long
enough and you thought,
5821.66 OK, now I see the vase and
the face and I can't unsee it.
5827.74 And every time I look,
it's there again, right?
5833.06 So yeah.
5834.17 So to come back
to the example you
5837.02 gave with your
colleague at Stanford
5841.68 whose book I know I have.
5842.97 I haven't read it.
5843.87 This is a-- he wrote
a book, Projections.
5846.46 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
5847.832 SAM HARRIS: So it's
on my stack to read.
5849.96 But it's the opposite--
5854.227 what I'm recommending
is, essentially,
5855.81 the opposite end
of the continuum
5857.4 of the internal
exercise he was doing.
5860.82 So rather than-- so
he's doing something
5863.52 very deliberate and controlled,
and he is deliberately
5869.1 thinking in complete
sentences and commandeering
5874.945 the machinery of thought
and attention in a way
5879.6 that I would imagine.
5880.62 I mean, I'd be interested
to talk to him about it.
5882.703 But I would imagine, he really
feels like he's doing that.
5887.025 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
He's an engineer--
5888.675 as you've describe it in
this way, it reminds me,
5892.15 he's a physician, but
he's also an engineer.
5894.9 So it's really about
taking the raw materials
5897.57 of thought and engineering
something structured from it.
5900.16 SAM HARRIS: Right.
5900.91 Right.
5901.41 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I haven't
been in Carl's mind.
5904.032 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
5904.74 But if we got him
talking on that,
5906.207 I'm sure we would get
a sense of what it is.
5908.04 ANDREW HUBERMAN: We'll do that
conversation at some point.
5911.25 It's the exact opposite
of what you're describing.
5912.48 SAM HARRIS: Exact
opposite would be
5913.938 to recognize that the sense of
control is a total illusion.
5921.48 Because you don't know what
you're going to think next.
5924.6 And even he, in the most
laborious way, I mean,
5927.84 he could just get as
muscular as he wants with it.
5932.25 He still doesn't know what
he's going to think next.
5936.87 Because thoughts simply arise.
5940.14 You can run this
experiment for yourself.
5942.06 And this connects up to
the topic of free will
5944.88 which we might want to touch.
5946.23 But I mean, just think
of any category of thing.
5949.89 If I asked you to think
of the names of cities
5952.89 or of friends you have or of
famous people you can remember
5958.5 exist or think of
nouns or anything.
5965.22 And just watch what
comes percolating
5967.74 into consciousness right now.
5971.906 There are things
you can't think of,
5973.427 there are things you
don't know the name of.
5975.26 There are languages
you don't speak,
5977.15 there are famous people you've
never seen or never heard of.
5980.45 So you have no control
over that part.
5982.16 Like those names
and faces are not
5984.74 going to suddenly come
streaming into consciousness.
5988.13 But the totality of
facts and figures
5991.76 and faces and names
that you do know,
5995.35 only some will come
vying for inclusion.
5999.4 And there's a sort of--
6002.1 we could make guess
and we know something
6005.433 about the neurology of this.
6006.6 But you depending
on what channel
6011.712 you're waiting for
thoughts in, I mean,
6013.38 it's going to be
different if it's visual
6015.088 or semantic or episodic memory.
6017.84 I mean, all of these
things are different.
6019.59 But wherever you
point your inner
6022.98 gaze of attention and wait
for the next face or name.
6028.95 Certain things are going
to come and certain things
6031.83 aren't going to come.
6032.79 And how you land on one--
6035.67 there'll be this process
if you're paying attention,
6037.96 you might think, let's say we
go with names of cities, right?
6042.99 So you'll think of Paris,
you'll think of London,
6045.15 you'll think of Rome,
you'll think of Sedona.
6048.48 So these names will come.
6050.44 And if I ask you to
just say one, right?
6053.71 So just--
6054.21 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Minneapolis
is what came to mind.
6055.77 For me, it was very
straightforward.
6056.83 It was Minneapolis, the
famous person was Joe Strummer
6059.08 and they just like--
6060.09 I can give you reasons why
I think those came to mind.
6062.88 Recent conversations.
6064.01 SAM HARRIS: OK.
6065.97 So we know a fair bit
about much of this.
6070.35 So one, we know that
your reasons, obviously,
6074.46 could be right or wrong.
6075.46 They're very likely
to be wrong because we
6077.37 have this confabulatory
storytelling mechanism even
6080.46 in an intact brain
where we just--
6083.64 we seem to never
lack for the reasons
6085.74 why something came
to mind, and we
6087.515 can know we can
manipulate people
6088.89 in ways that prove that
people are just reliably
6091.38 wrong and confident.
6092.58 You know, confidently
so about the reasons
6094.742 why they thought of
things or did things.
6096.45 But leaving that aside, even
if you're completely accurate,
6101.715 there are people's
names who you know
6103.8 and cities names that you
know that inexplicably just
6108.03 didn't come to mind.
6108.945 And if we ran this
experiment again and again
6110.82 and again, they
wouldn't come to mind
6112.5 if your brain was in
precisely the state
6114.3 it was in a moment ago.
6115.725 If we could return
your brain to the state
6117.57 it was in a moment
ago, correcting
6119.61 for all the deterministic
changes and all
6122.61 the random changes that would
have to be corrected for,
6125.49 it to just get--
all the synapses
6127.35 and the synaptic weights
and everything in the state
6130.47 it was in to produce Joe
Strummer in Minneapolis.
6133.98 If we rewind that movie, that
part of the movie of your life,
6137.7 you are going to say Joe
Strummer in Minneapolis
6140.16 a trillion times in a row.
6141.57 So this is why, in my view,
the notion of free will
6144.6 makes absolutely no sense.
6147.227 And you can add as much
randomness to that process
6149.31 as you want.
6150.03 It still doesn't get you the
freedom people think they have.
6153.722 There's another conversation
to have about why none of that
6156.18 matters and why
things only get better
6157.83 once you admit to yourself
that free will is an illusion.
6160.32 And yes, you can get in
shape and you can diet
6162.24 and you can do all the
things you want to do
6164.073 and you don't have to
think about free will.
6166.26 But from a contemplative,
meditative point of view,
6172.83 the thing to notice is
that everything is just
6175.59 springing into view.
6177.81 There's no place from
which you are authoring
6180.54 your next thought, because
you would have to think it
6182.97 before you think it.
6184.29 Like there is just this
fundamental mystery
6189.09 at our backs that is disgorging
everything that we experience.
6193.597 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
What if I'm speaking?
6195.18 So if I'm talking
about something
6197.22 and I have some command
of that information,
6200.49 I can often sense what I'm
going to say next and then
6203.25 find myself saying it.
6204.51 And hopefully, that's what they
say and not something else.
6206.968 I certainly said things
I didn't intend to say
6209.07 or never thought I
would say in life.
6210.75 But when engaged in
speech or action,
6214.98 it at least gives us
the illusion, I think,
6217.68 that we somehow have more
command over our thoughts.
6220.455 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
6221.64 Well you have a script.
6222.94 I mean, it's like there are
things you know a lot about
6225.51 and you've talked
about them a lot,
6228.21 and you know you
have the things you
6230.34 want to say about those
things and the things
6232.38 you don't want to say or
you wouldn't want to say.
6235.83 And you know you can--
6237.24 it still is a bit of a high wire
act, because you can misspeak
6240.0 or you can fail to get
to the end of a sentence
6241.958 in a grammatically correct way.
6244.26 And again, all of this--
objectively, this whole process
6247.62 is mysterious to you.
6249.49 You don't know how you follow
the rules of English grammar.
6253.44 Like your tongue is doing it
somehow and when it fails,
6259.74 it fails, and you're just
as surprised as the next guy
6262.8 that it failed.
6263.58 And you mispronounce
a word, and OK, I
6266.548 don't know what happened there.
6267.84 But if it keeps happening, I'm
going to worry I had a stroke.
6270.82 And if it stops, I'm not
going to worry about it.
6276.31 So it's still
mysterious even when
6279.15 you're doing it in a very rote,
deliberative, and repetitive
6285.99 way.
6286.53 But when you're
talking about something
6289.65 you've talked about a
lot and you know where
6292.497 you're going to go, right?
6296.358 We have many
conversations like this,
6301.02 it is somewhat analogous
to like a golf swing.
6303.24 Where it's like, you know
how you want to do it,
6304.86 it's going to be
all kinds of errors
6306.0 that are going to creep
into your execution of it
6308.042 in real time.
6308.98 But there's like you,
basically, have a pattern.
6311.82 And so you have certain
linguistic patterns
6314.46 which you're following.
6316.95 Again, none of this is
a proof of free will,
6320.58 but I will grant you that
phenomenologically, it
6323.16 feels different than just
waiting for the next thought
6326.01 to come.
6327.09 But my point is that,
even if you are--
6333.23 I mean, you can trim it down
to the simplest possible thing.
6335.73 Like you take two things
you like to drink.
6341.52 You like coffee
and you like tea.
6343.78 And you're deciding
which to have.
6345.42 Both are on offer.
6346.26 You've got two cups
in front of you.
6348.54 And the question is,
here I've got water
6351.51 and I've got coffee, which
am I going to drink next?
6354.39 Incredibly, it's as simple
as possible decision.
6357.87 And no matter how long I
make this decision process,
6362.37 I could literally sit for
an hour trying to figure out
6364.62 which to reach for next.
6366.66 And I could have my
reasons why, and I
6368.61 could have all my self talk.
6372.715 There's going to be a
final change in me that's
6376.09 going to be the proximate
cause of me deciding one
6378.55 over the other.
6379.54 And that, no matter
how laborious
6382.57 I can make it seem in terms
of my reasoning about it,
6388.66 it is going to be fundamentally
mysterious as to why I went
6392.8 with one rather than the other.
6394.81 Whatever story I have--
6395.92 because it's like-- it's still
going to be as mysterious
6399.79 as you thinking of Joe
Strummer when you absolutely--
6405.7 you know of the existence of
Marilyn Monroe just as much.
6411.28 And yet she simply
didn't occur to you.
6413.56 It's fundamentally mysterious.
6415.09 Like there are people who
are even more famous than Joe
6417.67 Strummer to you.
6420.04 I mean, I'm sure he may be
somebody who you have thought
6423.25 a lot about, but
there are people
6426.49 who like if we could just
inventory your conscious life
6429.76 going back the last
10 years, there
6431.723 are people who you've thought
about more than Joe Strummer
6434.14 yet they didn't appear.
6436.09 And that is mysterious.
6438.158 And they could have,
but they didn't.
6442.72 What I'm saying is that
this mystery never gets
6446.32 banished in our experience.
6448.15 Whatever stories.
6449.24 We have to tell about it.
6451.09 Because if the story is, oh,
well, I went for the water
6454.39 because I think I've been
drinking too much coffee.
6459.61 I listen to Andrew
Huberman's podcast
6461.72 and he was talking about
caffeine, and I think--
6463.72 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It's good for us,
6464.5 but you don't want to overdo it.
6465.44 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
6465.67 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
6465.94 SAM HARRIS: OK.
6466.18 So let's say that is,
actually, the causal chain.
6468.28 Like, I listen to
your podcast, you
6469.738 say something
about caffeine, now
6471.46 I'm self conscious
about my coffee intake.
6474.31 But that's just adding a
couple of links to the chain.
6478.74 There's still this
fundamental mystery of, well,
6482.18 why did I find that persuasive?
6484.04 And why did I find it persuasive
now and not five minutes ago
6488.24 when I was drinking the coffee?
6489.86 Like why did I just remember it
now, or why was it effective?
6494.07 You only have-- your
experience in every moment
6499.27 is precisely what it is
and not one bit more.
6504.22 And this subsumes even moments
of real resolve and effort
6509.14 and picking yourself
up by your bootstraps
6511.35 and changing everything.
6512.35 It's like you're on
a diet and you're
6514.81 tempted to eat chocolate.
6516.46 And you think you're
about to reach
6518.0 and say, no, I'm not
breaking this diet.
6520.48 This diet is actually
going to stick.
6522.91 Why did that arise in
that moment and not
6527.59 at this analogous moment
on your last diet?
6530.26 And why did it arise now
to precisely the degree
6533.47 that it did?
6535.03 Why will it be as
effective as it
6537.85 will be and have the
half-life that it will
6539.89 have and not 10% more or less.
6543.76 All of those are always
mysterious to you.
6546.045 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, could
we give, as we did before,
6549.61 an evolutionary and a
developmental explanation?
6552.07 An evolutionary
explanation might
6553.48 be that directed attention
and action is metabolically
6557.92 demanding.
6558.7 It would be inefficient
or impossible
6562.33 for us to be in constant,
deliberate action with access
6566.11 to all the relevant information
as to why we would do anything.
6569.03 So our ideas, literally,
spring to the surface
6573.34 at the last possible
moment in order
6575.89 to offset the great metabolic
requirements of having ideas
6581.47 that are related to
goal-directed action
6583.75 or that goal-directed
action is expensive.
6585.7 That's one idea.
6586.42 The other idea would
be-- and we know
6588.01 this as a fact, which is
that, initially, the brain is
6590.83 fairly crudely wired.
6592.078 That's not true within the
neural circuits that control
6594.37 breathing, heart
rate, et cetera,
6596.17 but within the neural circuits
of sensory perception, thought,
6599.21 et cetera.
6599.71 They're fairly crudely wired.
6601.24 And then across
development, there's
6603.73 a progressive pruning
back and also in parallel
6607.008 to that, a strengthening
of the connections
6608.8 that underlie directed
action and thought.
6611.59 And here, I don't mean directed
as in free will, I mean,
6614.11 just that I can decide
to imagine an apple
6617.29 and imagine that
apple, for instance.
6619.405 SAM HARRIS: Right.
6621.783 But your decision--
6622.575 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
There seems to be
6623.992 some maintenance of the fine
random wiring in systems.
6628.56 I mean, we've seen
this even in worms,
6630.81 in flies, in so-called lower
invertebrates and lower
6635.28 vertebrates.
6635.79 And we see this in humans.
6637.2 And it seems to be that
there's a lot of background
6640.23 spontaneous activity.
6641.28 I mean, I've sunk electrodes
into the brains of humans,
6644.26 macaques, carnivores, and mice.
6646.26 And in every case, most of
what you hear is called hash
6648.667 and it has nothing
to do with hashish.
6650.25 Is just [VOCALIZING]
on the audio monitor
6652.32 which is picking up a
bunch of action potentials.
6655.26 As you're listening to a
chorus of action potentials.
6658.63 But it's rare to find a neuron
that faithfully [VOCALIZING]
6662.07 fires to represent some
sensory stimulus in the world.
6665.79 And you can arrange that
marriage experimentally
6669.19 so that you can arrive at those
strong signal to noise events.
6672.1 But I was always struck
by how much noise there
6674.38 is in the system all
around all the time.
6677.05 And people argue, is the
noise really noise, et cetera?
6680.772 There's still a lot
of debate about that.
6682.48 But I can imagine that some
of the spontaneous nature
6685.87 of thoughts just
relates to the fact
6687.37 that there's a lot of
background spontaneous activity
6689.32 in the brain.
6690.11 Now, why that is a
whole other discussion.
6692.48 But if I were to set up two
constraints that there's
6695.29 a lot of spontaneous
activity, it's
6696.97 going to generate
random thoughts.
6699.27 Thankfully, not
much random action,
6700.77 although there's a little bit
of random action in our daily
6703.52 lives.
6704.02 And then against that say,
well, any deliberate thought
6707.28 or motion is going
to be expensive.
6711.18 It's a metabolically
expensive organ to begin with.
6713.68 And so you just have to--
6715.08 evolution has arrived at a place
where spontaneous geysering up
6720.09 of things upon which like
deliberate thoughts and action
6724.47 are superimposed is
the best arrangement
6727.5 overall for this very
metabolically demanding organ.
6730.687 I mean, what I
basically gave was just
6732.27 kind of a biological description
of just one narrow aspect
6736.06 of it.
6736.56 But can we get
comfortable with that?
6738.76 And the reason I say get
comfortable is that I'm--
6741.48 and here, admittedly,
I'm forcing a little bit
6743.43 of a striptease
towards what I think I
6745.14 and everyone else wants to
know, which is how to meditate
6747.515 and why, in particular,
meditation convinces us
6750.75 that something
doesn't necessarily
6752.485 have to be eliminated, but
that was actually never there.
6754.86 I feel like we've now set
up a sort of almost like a--
6759.84 you're not contradicting
yourself by any means,
6761.82 but in my mind, there's
a contradiction.
6763.68 And here's the contradiction.
6766.66 I love this statement
that meditation over time
6770.44 or done properly reveals
to us that we're actually
6772.84 not trying to make the gap
between actor and observer
6776.47 go away.
6777.01 It was actually never there.
6778.617 To me, that's one of the
more important statements
6780.7 that I, perhaps,
have ever heard.
6782.14 And it inspires me to go further
down this path of meditation,
6784.78 because I've never
experienced that.
6786.47 SAM HARRIS: Right.
6787.22 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
deliberately, and certainly,
6789.262 not through meditation.
6790.63 If I ever experienced it,
it was transient enough
6793.69 that I'm intrigued to
experience it more.
6796.288 So on the one hand,
you're telling me
6797.83 something was never there.
6799.04 And there's a
profound experience
6800.92 to be heard by anyone that's
willing to do the work
6803.86 to arrive at that experience
of the loss of that illusion.
6807.94 On the other hand, I'm
hearing that there's
6811.43 a profound gap that
really does exist,
6814.52 which is that we believe
that our thoughts are somehow
6820.27 from us.
6821.98 And indeed, they're from in the
cranial vault someplace, maybe,
6825.37 in the body a bit as well.
6827.41 But that we over attribute the
degree to which we are that
6835.54 and that is us in a way that's
volitional, that we control.
6839.74 And so once I'm hearing
that there's something--
6841.885 there's an illusion that we can
eliminate and on the other hand
6844.51 I'm hearing that there's
an illusion that we can't
6846.593 eliminate, and maybe
these are unrelated
6848.98 and I'm bridging them in
an unimportant way, that
6852.52 seems only important to me.
6853.78 But somehow, I can't
resolve these two
6856.42 and maybe the thing
to do then is, can we
6859.0 separate them in terms of
a practice to witness them?
6862.9 That would allow us to
resolve them separately.
6866.86 SAM HARRIS: Right.
6867.64 So I think I'm
hearing the problem.
6871.36 There's this-- let me bracket
the whole free will discussion
6876.04 because it really is the flip
side of this coin that I'm--
6881.95 the obverse of which is
the illusion of the self.
6884.77 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So at least--
6886.12 I might be on the right track.
6887.02 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
6887.34 Yeah.
6887.54 ANDREW HUBERMAN: They are
the opposite sides of a coin.
6889.75 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
6890.245 Yeah.
6890.41 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
6890.545 Great.
6891.045 Because to me they seem
very different in essence.
6893.385 SAM HARRIS: No.
6894.01 Because what I'm calling
the sense of self
6896.56 and what I think
most people feel
6898.51 as their core sense of
self is this feeling of--
6903.88 I mean, it's the feeling of
being the locus of attention,
6907.24 but it's also the feeling of
being the locus of agency.
6910.21 I can do the next thing.
6912.58 Like, who's doing this?
6913.9 Who's reaching for the cup?
6915.04 I am.
6915.61 Right?
6916.11 I intended this, and
now I'm doing the thing.
6919.57 And my conscious intention
is the proximate cause
6923.17 of my reaching, right?
6926.738 And so I'm the author of
my thoughts and actions,
6928.78 essentially.
6930.19 And my specific uses
of attention, right?
6932.98 So I can pay attention to the
breath, I get lost in thought,
6935.95 I come back to the breath.
6937.36 But on some level, the thoughts
themselves are more of my
6944.05 doing something with
almost authorial intent.
6949.9 Like I'm thinking like, what the
hell is this guy talking about?
6955.82 Who's thinking these thoughts?
6957.07 I am.
6958.87 The person who really
doesn't get what I'm saying
6960.97 is thinking something like that.
6963.01 What the fuck is this
guy talking about?
6964.735 I know I'm here.
6966.67 I'm a self, I'm a
body, I'm a mind.
6970.33 I can reach for things.
6971.5 That these intentional
actions are
6973.66 different from things
that happen to me.
6976.48 A voluntary action is different
from an involuntary one.
6979.63 So having a tremor is
different from consciously
6982.63 deciding to pick up a glass.
6985.42 So obviously, everything
I'm saying about meditation
6990.43 and the self and
free will in order
6992.56 to be a sane picture of a
human mind and of reality
6995.86 has to conserve the
data of experience
6998.53 such that, yes,
I can acknowledge
7000.33 the difference between a tremor
and a deliberative voluntary
7004.17 motor action.
7008.706 And the things you
do volitionally
7010.92 are different not just
psychologically and
7013.59 behaviorally, but they just
have different implications
7016.41 for like in a court of law.
7017.94 You accidentally hit
someone with your car
7020.047 or you did it on
purpose, that's still
7021.63 a distinction that matters.
7023.84 Importantly, it tells us a lot
about the global properties
7027.75 of your mind such that we
have a sense of what you're
7030.09 likely to do in the future.
7031.05 If you're someone who
likes running over people
7033.008 with your car,
you're a psychopath
7034.935 who we need to worry about.
7036.06 If you're is someone
who did it by accident,
7037.893 well then you may be culpable
for the level of negligence
7042.9 that allow that to happen.
7044.34 But you're a very different
person and we you differently
7047.43 and we're wise to.
7049.68 So anyway, we can
bracket all of that.
7056.1 There's this-- I mean,
there are some fundamental--
7058.79 there are some false
assumptions about the underlying
7063.08 logic of this process, which,
I think, is worth addressing.
7067.49 Is actually-- there was a kind
of found object in the news
7071.27 that I talk about at one point.
7074.03 I forget where it
is in Waking Up app.
7076.22 But there was a story that
I stumbled on the internet.
7080.31 I think it's about
12 or 13 years old.
7082.55 Of a tourist bus in--
7085.088 I think it was in Norway.
7086.13 It was somewhere
in Northern Europe.
7089.9 And it had about
30 people on it.
7091.47 And one person was
described as an Asian woman.
7095.36 And they went to a rest stop
and everyone got off the bus.
7100.86 And shopped and had lunch.
7103.25 And this Asian woman changed her
clothing for whatever reason.
7107.3 And they all got
back on the bus.
7109.65 I think the relevance of
it being an Asian woman
7111.65 is that there were
language barriers that
7113.9 explain what later happened.
7116.27 So everyone gets
back on the bus,
7117.8 the Asian woman has
changed her clothing.
7119.93 And the bus is about to leave
but then someone notices, hey,
7122.93 there was an Asian woman who
got off the bus who isn't--
7125.63 it hasn't come back yet.
7126.89 And they tell the driver this.
7129.53 And this poses a problem.
7131.093 So now everyone's waiting
for this person to return.
7133.26 But in fact, everyone
was on the bus.
7134.942 This woman had just
changed her clothing,
7136.65 and was not recognized
by her fellow travelers.
7140.51 So everyone gets concerned as
this tourist doesn't show up.
7146.39 And they start looking for her.
7149.45 And they can't find her.
7150.78 And so a search party is formed.
7152.36 And the Asian woman, because
of whatever language barrier,
7158.295 heard that there was
a missing tourist,
7159.92 so she joins the
search party, which,
7162.05 in fact, is looking for her.
7163.97 And this goes on into the night.
7165.77 And they're readying
helicopters for a dawn patrol
7169.28 to find the missing tourist.
7171.68 Now, at some point
along the way,
7173.37 I think it was at like
3:00 in the morning,
7175.34 this tourist realizes that she
is the object of this search.
7181.07 And obviously, the
whole thing unravels.
7184.07 She confesses that she changed
her clothes and the problem
7187.88 is solved.
7188.64 But the problem is not
solved by the logic
7193.61 that the seeker is expected.
7195.84 So it's like, it's
not true to say
7198.53 that the missing
tourist was found
7201.35 in the way that was expected.
7202.882 Because a missing
tourist was never lost.
7204.59 The missing tourist was
part of the search party.
7207.847 So when you think about
it from her point of view,
7209.93 like what happened, she's
part of the search party.
7212.81 She's looking for the
missing tourist not knowing
7216.2 that she, in fact, is
the missing tourist.
7218.99 So what happens at the moment
she realizes that everyone's
7225.47 looking for her?
7228.942 The search isn't
consummated in the way
7232.37 that is implied by the logic
of everyone's use of attention.
7236.21 And yet the problem evaporates.
7238.85 And there's something
deeply analogous
7242.3 about the structure of that
and the meditative journey.
7248.03 Precisely in, again, not talking
about all the possible changes
7252.283 in the contents of consciousness
that could be good,
7254.45 which, again, they
come along for the ride
7257.0 anyway when you do the
thing I'm talking about.
7261.48 It's on this point of
looking for the self
7263.97 and not finding it.
7265.06 And there is this sense
that, OK, the self is here,
7270.33 and it's a problem.
7271.29 It is the string upon which
all of my conscious states,
7275.43 mostly unhappy ones, are strong.
7277.85 It's the thing that is at
the center of my anxiety.
7282.177 It's the thing that I
don't feel good about.
7284.01 It's the thing that when
criticized, I let implode.
7289.62 It's the center of my
problem, and now I'm
7291.553 trying to feel better.
7292.47 And meditation has
been handed to me
7294.57 as a possible remedy
for my situation.
7299.19 And it's billed as a remedy.
7300.63 And in fact, I'm
hearing from this guy
7303.48 that this is the thing that is
going to cause me to realize
7306.75 that my self isn't where--
7309.0 or as I thought it was.
7311.59 So now I'm going to look.
7313.02 And so again, the
sense is, I start out
7319.36 far away from the goal here.
7320.8 I start out with a problem.
7322.78 I'm now meditating on the
evidence of my enlightenment.
7326.17 I can feel my problem.
7327.61 I feel that I'm distracted
and distractible.
7330.13 And I feel as this sort
of cramp at the center
7333.04 of my life, that's me.
7334.69 And I'm not as happy as
I want to be, I'm not
7336.61 as confident as I want to be.
7337.975 I'm more distractible
than I want to be.
7339.77 And now, I'm paying
attention to the breath.
7344.52 This is what the search
party feels like.
7346.59 This is what the
confused tourist feels
7349.56 like in her own search party.
7351.15 And she's looking for
the missing person.
7356.67 So the angle of--
7358.71 the inclination of
all of this is--
7361.8 and the logic of it is all
wrong, understandably so,
7367.44 given how we all get
into this situation.
7370.29 But it's useful
to continually try
7373.93 to undercut it and recognize
that the thing that's
7380.94 being looked for is actually
right on the surface, which
7384.78 is, there is no one looking.
7387.06 There is no place
from which you are--
7389.58 if you're paying attention
to the breath or to sounds
7392.64 or noticing the
next thought arise,
7395.67 this sense that you
are over here doing
7399.12 that thing is actually what
it's like to be thinking
7403.13 and not knowing that
you're thinking.
7405.793 There's an
undercurrent of thought
7407.21 that's going uninspected
in that moment.
7409.53 And so there is just--
7412.5 there's a continually
looking for the mind,
7415.31 looking for the
center of experience,
7417.07 looking for the one who is
looking, which, again, which
7419.93 is the orienting practice here.
7423.23 And there's a lot more I
say about this, obviously,
7426.71 over waking up.
7428.09 But it's the experiment you
have to perform in order
7432.81 to get ready to recognize that
the search party was formed
7438.975 in error, essentially.
7440.37 And the problem
that you're trying
7443.61 to solve with this
practice does evaporate
7447.6 in a similar way, which is
like, you don't actually
7450.93 get there in the way
that you're hoping for.
7455.52 It's like you drop out
the bottom of this thing
7457.89 in an unexpected way.
7460.68 There's actually another
similar parable or anecdote
7466.2 that I don't remember
if it's Zen or Sufi or--
7468.3 I mean, I'm sure it's
been re-appropriated
7470.05 in many different ways or by
many different traditions.
7473.19 But the case of somebody who's
lost in a town and they're
7478.08 asking for directions and you
can put this in Manhattan.
7482.252 Let's say, you're wandering
Manhattan and you're a tourist,
7484.71 you don't know
where anything is.
7486.085 And you stop and ask someone,
where is Central Park?
7489.69 And the person thinks for a
second and they says, oh, yeah.
7492.18 Unfortunately, you can't get
to Central Park from here.
7496.02 Now, that is a very strange--
7498.15 I mean, you think about
that for a second.
7499.9 You realize, OK,
that's an absurd.
7504.09 There is no place that you can't
get to from the place you're
7506.97 starting on Earth.
7508.717 ANDREW HUBERMAN: A
failure to describe
7510.3 the physical relationships
between anything in the world.
7513.072 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
7513.78 That's just not the
world we live in.
7515.52 So but it's a funny thing.
7517.48 But on some level that
is true of meditation.
7522.0 It's like you can't
get there from here.
7525.66 The sense of view as
subject isn't brought along
7529.68 to this thing
you're looking for.
7535.75 It's almost like
you're making a fist
7538.23 and you're trying to
get to an open hand.
7543.03 The fist doesn't get to
take that journey as a fist.
7548.7 The fist doesn't go
along for the ride.
7550.39 The fist comes apart.
7553.35 And on some level,
the subjectivity
7555.9 is an attentional fist.
7560.805 It is a contraction of energy.
7563.19 Again, it's so much bound up
and thought for most of us,
7568.56 most of the time.
7569.93 And when properly
inspected, there's
7573.44 just this evaporation
of the starting point.
7577.07 But there's not this fulfillment
of, I'm going to get--
7580.82 this fixed is just going to--
7584.27 if life gets good enough, if
I get concentrated enough,
7586.85 focused enough, if
I austere enough,
7590.21 if I renounce enough,
if I desire less, if I--
7594.74 with enough good
intentions, this fist
7597.83 is going to move into some
sort of sublime condition.
7601.01 That's not the logic
of the process.
7605.12 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I really
appreciate these models
7608.76 and analogies for
conscious experience
7610.65 both as most people experience
them and harbor them
7614.19 and as a way to frame
what's possible through
7618.0 a proper meditation practice.
7620.26 I do want to talk about
what a proper meditation
7622.26 practice looks like a bit.
7625.21 But at some point, I do want to
raise a model of, maybe, even
7631.11 just perceptual awareness to
see if it survives the filters
7635.31 that you've provided.
7638.25 But first, briefly, and
then we can return to it.
7643.44 What does this meditation
practice or set of practices
7647.52 look like?
7648.09 Obviously, the app
is a wonderful tool.
7650.58 I've started using it.
7651.54 As I mentioned at the
beginning, my father's
7653.43 been using it for a
while and many people
7655.41 have derived great
benefit from it.
7657.25 But if we were to break
it down, meditation
7661.26 into some basic component
parts as we have broken down
7667.26 normal perceptual experience in
some of its component parts--
7670.425 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
7671.645 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --I can
just throw out some things
7673.77 that I associate
with meditation,
7675.45 and maybe you can elaborate
on how these may or may not
7678.42 be applied.
7679.0 For instance, there
is almost always
7683.25 a ceasing of robust
motor movement.
7687.54 I know they're walking
meditations and so forth.
7689.62 But it seems like sitting or
lying down and, perhaps, not
7693.27 always but often limiting
our visual perception,
7696.87 closing the eyes.
7697.695 SAM HARRIS: Right.
7698.65 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Directing
a mind's eye someplace.
7702.69 Is there a dedicated effort
toward generating imagery?
7707.01 What are the component parts?
7708.48 And where I'm really going
with this is, why would those
7711.09 component parts, eventually,
allow for this dissolution
7714.42 of the fist or the
realization that there
7717.63 is no distinction between
actor and observer and so on.
7721.572 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
7722.28 Yeah.
7722.78 Well, so to answer the second
question first, ultimately,
7726.0 meditation is not a
practice that you're
7730.26 adding to your life.
7732.36 It's not a doing
more of anything.
7733.86 It's actually ceasing
to do something.
7735.81 It's ultimately non-distraction.
7738.78 I mean, ultimately, you're
recognizing what consciousness
7741.42 is like when you're
no longer distracted
7743.64 by the automatic
arising of thought.
7747.293 It's not the
thoughts don't arise,
7748.71 it's not that you
can't use them,
7750.085 it's not that you become
irrational or unintelligent,
7755.43 I mean, all of that-- you
still have all of your tools,
7757.95 but everything is in plain view.
7761.93 I mean, there's an analogy in
Tibetan Buddhism which I love,
7764.6 which is you're kind of in
the final stage of meditation,
7770.02 thoughts are like thieves
entering an empty house.
7772.99 There's nothing
for them to steal.
7774.91 So in the usual case,
thoughts are-- there really
7778.63 is something in jeopardy.
7780.01 Every time a thought comes,
I'm not meditating anymore,
7782.71 and not only that,
I feel terrible
7784.84 because of what I'm thinking
about most of the time.
7788.86 And so it's totally
understandable
7792.595 that thoughts seem like a
problem in the beginning.
7794.72 And for certain
types of meditation,
7796.63 they are explicitly
thought of as a problem
7799.09 because you're trying
to focus on one thing
7801.94 to the exclusion of everything
else, including thought.
7804.37 And that is what I called the
concentration practice earlier.
7809.07 And that's a training
that can be good to do.
7812.76 It becomes a tool that you can
use for other kinds of insight.
7817.11 But it's a very specific
and it's kind of brittle
7820.65 skill in the end.
7821.79 I mean, it's a skill.
7822.898 Just like I'm going to
pay attention to one thing
7824.94 and I'm going to do that so
well that everything else is
7827.4 going to fade out.
7828.655 And it's somewhat
analogous to what you
7830.28 described in the visual system.
7832.62 If have a laser focus
to one fixation point,
7836.16 everything else in your visual
field begins to fade out.
7841.43 But meditatively, if you have
a laser focus on any one thing,
7845.05 whether it's the breath or a
candle flame or whatever it is,
7850.69 not only does--
7852.04 I mean, let's use the
breath for a second.
7856.712 Because your eyes can be closed.
7860.61 I mean, you can lose
all sense of everything.
7862.832 I mean, you can lose
all sense of hearing
7864.54 and your physical
body can disappear.
7866.43 I mean, like, literally, it
can become incredibly subtle
7869.28 and vast and drug-like.
7872.28 And many people
approach meditation
7875.94 thinking climbing the
ladder of those changes
7879.33 into subtlety and vastness,
that's the whole game.
7883.41 And it can be a deeply
rewarding game to play.
7887.28 And it also does come with all
kinds of ancillary benefits.
7890.73 I mean, all the
focus and the calm
7892.515 and the smoothness
of emotional states.
7895.98 I mean, all of that comes
with greater concentration.
7898.26 And it can be quite wonderful.
7900.96 But again, at best, that's a
tool to aim in the direction
7905.22 that I'm talking about now
with respect to meditation,
7908.89 which relates to more what
I would call mindfulness
7912.54 generically.
7915.03 And ultimately,
non-dual mindfulness.
7917.91 So mindfulness
generically and for most
7921.45 people, certainly
in the beginning,
7924.08 dualistically is
just the practice
7927.17 of paying careful attention to
whatever is arising on its own.
7934.23 Now in the beginning, it's
natural to take a single object
7937.86 like the breath as
a starting point.
7939.93 It's an anchor.
7942.18 But very, very quickly, over the
course of even your first week
7946.14 of doing this, teachers and
various sources of information
7951.99 will recommend that once you get
some facilities-- once you know
7955.57 the difference between
being lost in thought
7957.57 and actually paying attention
to the breath, well,
7960.06 then you can open
it up to everything.
7961.912 You can open up the sounds
and other sensations
7963.87 in the body and
moods and emotions.
7967.35 And even, ultimately,
thoughts themselves.
7971.55 So very quickly,
you can recognize
7973.53 that thoughts are
not intrinsically
7976.91 the enemy to this practice.
7978.29 They are also just spontaneous
appearances in consciousness
7981.5 that can be observed.
7983.78 But for some considerable
period of time,
7986.81 people will feel that
there is a place from which
7989.42 that observation is happening.
7991.22 There's just, I'm now the
one who's being mindful.
7996.2 And however attenuated that
sense of self can be, I mean,
8000.78 again, it can get
very expansive.
8002.76 I mean, you can lose--
8005.49 as you get anything, just
a modicum of concentration,
8009.57 you know it becomes
very drug-like
8011.61 and you get the boundaries
of your body dissolve.
8015.03 And your feeling of having
a body can disappear.
8018.9 And you if your eyes are closed,
you know your visual field--
8022.543 I mean, most people, when they
close their eyes initially,
8024.96 they just forget about
their visual field.
8026.71 But if you close
your eyes right now,
8028.77 you notice your visual
field is fully present.
8031.74 And we call it dark,
but it's not quite dark.
8035.67 There is a sort of scintillating
some field of color and shadow
8042.84 that's there in the darkness
of your closed eyes.
8045.57 And that can become
a sky-like domain
8050.1 of vast visual
expression that opens up
8057.18 as you get more concentrated
with your eyes closed right.
8061.05 So you can very much be aware
of seeing with your eyes closed
8064.62 in a meditative practice.
8068.33 But from the point of
view of mindfulness,
8071.77 the logic is not to care about
any of the interesting changes
8076.57 and experience that come
as a result of practicing
8079.54 in this way, because
the underlying goal
8083.19 is to be more and more
equanimous with changes.
8089.39 So it's not to grasp at
what's pleasant or interesting
8091.69 and not to push what's
unpleasant or boring
8096.04 or otherwise not
engaging in a way.
8100.96 What you want is just a kind
of a sky-like mind that just
8105.07 allows everything to appear.
8106.51 And you're not
clinging to anything
8108.6 or reacting to anything.
8111.16 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could I ask
you what your thoughts are
8113.47 about the differences between
nouns, adjectives, and verbs
8119.59 in the context of what
we're talking about
8121.925 in you're describing?
8122.8 And the reason I bring this
up is that as you know,
8126.94 I know everything in
biology is a process.
8129.1 We would never ever
say, oh, the perception
8132.85 of that red line on
a painting is a noun.
8137.77 I mean, it's an event
in the visual system.
8139.87 You're abstracting
some understanding
8141.91 about that thing in
the outside world.
8144.02 And I think it's very useful
in thinking about the brain.
8149.08 People will notice I notice--
8150.34 I, excuse me, actively avoid
the use of the word mind,
8153.37 because I figure, especially,
with sitting across from me,
8156.25 that I'll step in it if I do.
8159.34 But the brain generates
a series of perceptions
8164.22 or what have you by through
processes, not nouns.
8168.33 And so when thinking about
biology, I think of development
8171.29 is an arc of processes.
8173.303 Aging is an arc-- perception
is an arc of processes.
8175.47 They just exist on
different time scales.
8177.3 And so a little bit
of what I'm hearing
8180.21 is that inside of an
effective meditation practice,
8184.03 there's a little bit of
certainly non-judgment
8187.35 but discarding of the
noun and the adjective
8191.1 modes of language.
8192.75 Like red apple.
8193.629 OK.
8194.129 It's a red apple,
but then you need
8196.59 to eliminate some other
adjectives about it.
8198.93 It's a rotten apple,
it's a ripe apple.
8202.049 And instead view the
appearance and disappearance
8204.87 of that apple as just a thing, a
process as opposed to an event.
8209.86 And now, events,
we could really get
8211.379 into the language aspect of it.
8212.745 That just reveals how
diminished language
8215.76 is to describe the workings
of the brain at some level.
8220.73 I don't know if any
of these resonates.
8222.68 But it seems to me, the
goal or one of the goals
8225.08 is to start to understand
the algorithm that
8227.959 is the fleeting nature of
perception but to not focus
8231.41 on any one single perception.
8233.18 And then to not even focused
on one single algorithm,
8235.7 but to, at some
level, there's a--
8239.12 what is revealed to
the meditator over time
8241.91 is some sort of
macroscopic principle
8244.969 about the way perceptions
work at a deeper level.
8250.129 That there's a deeper principle
there that sits below our--
8254.78 certainly our normal
everyday awareness.
8256.95 But that in paying attention to
the mechanics of all this stuff
8259.67 and not judging those mechanics,
not naming those mechanics,
8262.549 or just naming them
and let them pass by.
8264.53 That there's some
action function,
8266.54 some verb is revealed.
8268.219 And that maybe that
verb-- may be the word
8270.2 to describe that
verb is mindfulness.
8272.51 Maybe mindfulness is really
just a verb to describe that.
8276.44 I don't know.
8278.362 Is there anything here?
8279.32 Or am I-- I don't know
if I'm creating just
8282.53 like useless straw or
if there's actually
8284.959 a seed here of something real.
8286.35 But to me, any time I want
to understand something
8288.74 in biology or psychology, I
try and broaden the time domain
8292.711 and think in terms of verbs,
not nouns or adjectives.
8294.919 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
8295.7 Yeah, yeah.
8296.27 No.
8296.99 That's very useful,
and that's somewhat
8299.99 adjacent to this
distinction I'm making
8301.82 between dualistic and
non-dualistic ways
8304.52 of experiencing the world.
8306.299 So even dualistically,
everything is still a process.
8309.92 And we're misled
by the reification
8312.889 that noun talk gives us.
8316.25 And this applies not just to
something like mindfulness,
8318.98 but even to something
like the self.
8321.08 So the sense of self
is also a process.
8325.04 I mean, it's a verb,
it's not-- so we're self
8328.219 in more than we are ourselves.
8332.84 And there are-- even appropriate
uses of the term self
8339.26 that don't go away
even when you recognize
8342.65 that the core subject,
self, is an illusion.
8346.669 There are states of self where
you can recognize in your life
8351.799 that you inhabit very different
modes of being depending
8356.33 on the context.
8357.15 So like there are
moments where you--
8359.18 just by walking into
a certain building,
8362.09 you suddenly transition into
a different state of self.
8364.79 Like suddenly, you
pass through a door
8367.37 and now you are a customer
in a store, right?
8370.16 So we know what that
customer feeling is.
8372.59 Like, you're now the person
who's getting the attention.
8375.23 It's a very formalized
type of attention
8377.18 from the person who is running
the store or a restaurant.
8382.129 You're a customer
at a restaurant.
8383.99 That's a-- I just remembered
something that's funny.
8389.03 That was born of a
mismatch of this.
8391.88 I'll come back to
that in a second.
8394.91 So there are-- so
we go through it.
8400.41 You can be a student in
the presence of a teacher,
8402.87 you're going to be a
parent in the presence
8404.662 of a son or a daughter,
you can be a spouse
8407.538 in the presence of your spouse.
8408.83 And all of those shadings of--
8412.34 like the change in context
really does usher in some
8420.8 fundamental
psychological changes
8422.93 in just the states
of consciousness
8425.12 that are available to you.
8427.49 And some of this is really--
8428.72 I mean, I'm sure we could
understand a lot about this
8432.77 personally and generically.
8435.41 But it is pretty mysterious.
8438.72 I mean, there are
people who I know
8441.43 who I'm with them
in a certain way,
8444.73 and based on something
I'm getting off of them,
8449.74 I can't be that--
8451.57 I'm effortlessly
one way with them,
8454.3 and there's no way I could be
that way with somebody else.
8458.35 I don't know if it's the
pheromones or their facial,
8461.142 just the way they are,
their facial expression.
8463.1 But I mean, there are
people with whom I'm really
8467.05 kind of effortlessly
funny, and there
8469.3 are people with whom
I couldn't even--
8470.95 it would never occur to me to be
funny no matter what happened.
8474.28 And I have long
standing relationships
8476.74 with these people, so all
of that's very mysterious.
8482.14 But anyway, the
difference there is not
8485.41 in this core sense of
subject in relationship
8489.25 to all the objects, it's in
kind of the states of self.
8494.44 And all of that is very verby.
8496.99 All this is a
pattern of changes.
8499.43 It's a pattern of
what's available
8500.98 and what's not available,
the capacities there that
8504.4 come online or not in
those various contexts.
8508.63 But no, the memory
I just had, which
8510.37 I hadn't had in a long time.
8512.92 But it was one of
these moments where
8514.84 I realized the power of
these shifts in context
8519.55 for states of self.
8520.84 So once, I was a young man.
8524.77 I think I was probably
22 or so, and single.
8531.04 And like, you're just
like, trying to figure out
8533.38 how do you meet women?
8535.0 And how does one get
confident to do this well?
8537.88 And I walked into a restaurant
and a kind of a woman
8546.55 was walking toward me, toward
the front door of the restroom.
8550.84 But she was walking toward me
in a way where I just by default
8553.45 assumed she was the
hostess in the restaurant.
8557.41 But she wasn't the
hostess, she was just
8561.62 someone who had just
eaten there, I guess.
8563.74 So I walked through,
and she comes out.
8565.39 And so there's a fundamental
misunderstanding in me
8567.88 that's set up by literally just
this change in architecture.
8571.42 And so I just said
hi to her in a way
8573.73 that I presumably I would
say hi to any hostess who
8576.07 was coming up to ask me
where I wanted to sit.
8579.94 But what had
actually happened is
8581.65 I had said hi to a
total stranger in a way
8584.56 that I tended at
that point never
8586.423 to say hi to total
strangers because I was shy
8588.34 and it was just like that.
8590.23 But apparently, I gave her
like a 10,000 watt high
8594.37 of all of the confidence
you would have if you
8597.13 were that sort of person.
8598.27 And it just ushered
in a complete like--
8601.42 so I went to my
table, and this woman,
8603.4 I came back into the restaurant
and gave me her phone number,
8606.61 which was something that
was just a completely
8608.53 foreign experience to me,
and it was based completely
8612.01 on my misunderstanding of
the situation I was in.
8615.64 And so anyway--
8618.547 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Among
the misunderstandings
8620.38 that one can have and then
action and engage in life,
8623.68 I would say that was a
somewhat adaptive one.
8626.35 SAM HARRIS: Yeah, but
then you realize that, OK,
8628.54 but then there
are certain people
8630.16 who recognize this
machinery to whatever degree
8633.73 or have kind of natural
aptitudes for bringing
8636.16 certain things online or not
such that they can consciously
8642.55 make these states of self,
this level of gregariousness,
8646.36 say, available to them
in the circumstances
8650.65 where it's is actually
useful to them.
8652.27 So if you're single and
you want to meet people,
8654.43 well, it's actually very
helpful to feel confident enough
8658.6 to just go say hi to strangers
and ask them how they're doing
8661.33 and to be online in that way.
8665.98 Where at that point in my
life, in that circumstance,
8670.785 by default, I was
going to ignore
8672.16 this stranger who I was
passing by in the doorway
8674.68 of a restaurant.
8675.59 But thinking she
was the hostess,
8677.53 I was engaging her fully.
8680.71 So anyway, you can
consciously-- again,
8682.81 this does not invoke
free will at all.
8684.55 But yes, you can
consciously decide
8686.2 to play with these
mechanisms such
8688.3 that you can decide
what states of self
8693.61 would be more normative to have
given what you want in life.
8697.0 And you can become increasingly
attentive to the ways in which
8701.56 you get played by the world.
8703.543 You're a kind of instrument.
8704.71 Your mind is a
kind of instrument.
8706.127 Your brain is a kind of
instrument that is continually
8709.0 getting played by the
situations you are in,
8712.51 and you can become more
of an intelligent curator
8716.23 of your conscious states and
your conscious capacities
8719.36 just by noticing
the changes in you.
8721.12 Like, in graduate school,
it's something I talk about.
8724.42 I think at some
point in waking up,
8727.07 this became very stark for me
because I was an old graduate
8732.96 student.
8733.46 I had taken 11 years off at
Stanford between my sophomore
8737.12 and junior year.
8737.96 So when I went back to school--
8739.752 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Talk
about a leave of absence.
8741.71 SAM HARRIS: Yeah, but I
mean, Stanford had this,
8743.75 you might know this.
8745.653 They have this stop out policy
where you never really drop
8748.07 out, you just stop as you want.
8749.362 You can always go back.
8750.41 You don't have to
write letters saying
8751.993 that you still exist
every two years as you
8754.22 do in other schools.
8755.15 So anyway, I showed
up after 11 years.
8760.1 So I was really on a deadline,
and I felt late for everything.
8763.37 So I'm kind of
finishing my degree
8765.44 as quickly as I can
as an undergraduate,
8767.498 and then I jump into
graduate school,
8769.04 and I'm an old graduate student.
8772.724 There's a real sense of urgency.
8774.62 Like, I'm late.
8775.38 I should have done this earlier.
8776.713 I want to get this stuff done.
8778.37 But then 9/11 happened.
8781.19 And just as I had finished
my coursework getting my PhD,
8786.47 and I was just getting
into my research but 9/11
8790.16 intersected with my
life in such a way
8791.777 that I just had to drop
everything and write
8793.61 my first book.
8794.52 And I did that.
8795.21 And then I just had to
drop everything and write
8797.21 my second book because of the
response to the first book.
8799.64 And so essentially, I
had like, four years,
8801.89 where I was AWOL doing my PhD.
8805.52 But I still had a toe in
the lab and I was still
8807.77 showing up occasionally.
8808.79 But I was becoming this
kind of cautionary tale
8811.1 from the point of
view of grad school,
8812.78 but I was also becoming kind of
a famous or semi-famous writer
8817.16 because my first book had been
a New York Times best seller,
8821.24 so I was getting some
notoriety as a writer.
8824.71 And so I was doing things
like, I was giving a Ted Talk
8827.127 but I still hadn't
finished graduate school.
8828.96 So it was I think that
timing's is right, maybe
8832.363 I had just finished
graduate school when
8834.03 I gave the Ted Talk.
8834.87 But anyway, so I was
rowing in two boats
8839.01 and one boat was
sinking or showing
8841.23 every sign of being damaged.
8843.48 And I was literally
like, getting letters
8845.91 from the head of the
department saying,
8847.635 we're concerned about you.
8848.91 But on the other hand, I was
becoming a quasi celebrity
8854.07 in that world too, at least in
a world that was overlapping.
8858.54 So I was having the experience
of going in the moment where
8863.31 this crystallized for me
in a fairly peculiar way
8867.96 was, I had a meeting
at like 3:00 o'clock
8870.48 with my advisor who
was just this guy,
8872.91 Mark Cohen, in the brain
mapping center at UCLA who's
8875.76 a fantastic guy.
8878.31 Great advisor.
8879.39 I did not extract as much wisdom
from him as I should have.
8883.59 Brilliant scientist.
8884.7 And for him, I'm late.
8889.38 At least, in my head--
8890.31 he is not that he was riding
me so hard but in my head,
8892.65 I'm very self
conscious about how
8894.45 I'm not living up to his
expectations at this point.
8899.11 So I have a meeting with
him at 3:00 o'clock,
8901.11 and I'm just kind of
wilting under his gaze
8905.97 and my own imagined
inner gaze of his.
8911.36 But two hours later,
I have a meeting
8914.43 with his boss, a dinner
meeting with his boss
8917.73 who wants to meet with me to get
advice on launching his book.
8921.383 We have the same
publisher but I'm
8922.8 like, the much bigger
author at Norton,
8926.325 and he's coming
to me for advice.
8930.12 And so I'm ricocheting between
two diametrically opposite self
8935.52 states that are-- again, this
comes down to architecture.
8938.412 It's literally like
the state I was
8939.87 in walking into one building
and then leaving and walking
8942.54 into another building
on the same campus.
8946.71 And they were completely
opposite self concepts.
8952.2 Like, in one context,
I am a fuckup.
8957.0 In another context,
I'm a celebrity.
8959.52 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And you
have mastery and virtuosity,
8962.37 and we're developing
it very quickly.
8964.59 SAM HARRIS: But so
again, this is a kind
8966.93 of a stark version of that.
8968.44 But everyone has
some version of this
8971.04 just in bouncing between
talking to their mom
8974.61 and then talking to
their best friend
8976.29 and then talking to a stranger
and talking to someone who's
8980.052 very successful,
talking to someone
8981.51 who's not very successful.
8983.01 You notice your vulnerability
to all of this stuff.
8985.86 And ultimately, what
you want is a level
8991.54 of psychological integrity that
is truly divorceable from that.
8996.76 Now, I'm not I'm not
saying you're ever
8999.07 going to get it perfect, there's
always going to be some--
9003.62 I mean, I can't talk about
the ultimate fulfillment
9007.64 of this process.
9009.41 I'm not a Buddha, I'm not saying
I've finished the project.
9012.86 But I think there's more and
more as you become sensitive
9020.81 to these changes and you become
sensitive to what it's like
9023.48 to actually not be
psychologically reactive
9027.32 and not be definable by your
own self-concept, your own--
9032.708 you're not identifying
with anything,
9034.25 you're not hanging
your hat on anything,
9035.917 you're not thinking about
yourself in the kind of terms
9042.41 that you would export
to others and then
9044.57 care about what they
think about you.
9047.33 There's a kind of
invulnerability
9050.9 that arises that's not borne
of being well defended,
9057.18 it's born of being evaporated.
9060.11 It's like, you're no longer
keeping score in those ways.
9063.185 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Once
again, I really appreciate
9065.81 that description
because these days,
9068.09 I'm really intrigued
by something
9070.85 we've known for a long
time that you're certainly
9073.4 familiar with is the prefrontal
cortex's ability to establish
9076.73 context dependent rule sets.
9078.38 A Stroop task would
be basic example
9080.96 of reading numbers
or letters on cards
9083.6 and then switching
to having to report
9085.19 the colors that the letters
and numbers are written in.
9087.23 It's a basic task.
9088.19 But prefrontal cortex,
obviously important for setting
9091.64 context dependent thought and
behavior and directed action.
9095.0 But within the context of all
these different variations
9098.66 of the self, depending on
graduate school or relationship
9104.42 where sitting alone
in one's room,
9106.36 there are different
rule sets arise
9108.1 and somehow, we are able to have
a coherent sense of self that
9112.09 encompasses all of those.
9113.92 Functional people can toggle
between them as needed and not
9118.33 overlap them inappropriately.
9119.77 At least not to the
extent that it's
9121.66 career failing or life failing.
9123.31 Although there are sad
examples of that, many of which
9128.2 exist in the Twitter space.
9130.63 I know several colleagues,
not directly of mine,
9133.84 but people who threw mistakes
made with their thumbs,
9137.14 where they forgot
context or forgot
9140.89 to realize that the context on
social media is near infinite.
9145.0 But the context that
existed in their head
9146.77 might not be clear in the
way that they communicated
9149.26 something, and they
lost their jobs
9151.48 by saying what were perceived
as insensitive things.
9154.27 In some cases were, in fact,
offensive, insensitive things.
9157.45 In some cases, it's debatable.
9160.97 In any case, I think that the
image that now comes to mind
9165.23 relates to something you've said
several times, that it's not
9168.44 about eliminating
something, it's
9170.0 about revealing that something
was never actually there.
9173.055 And then in terms of
sensory experience
9174.68 and these different
aspects of the self,
9176.57 I have this image
in my mind of--
9178.97 I'm not an experienced
scuba diver,
9180.65 but I've done enough of it.
9181.84 I've worn a wetsuit.
9182.87 You wear a complete
wetsuit with the hood.
9184.67 And this idea if you were
born into that wetsuit,
9188.54 you might think that yeah,
you nudge up or lean up
9192.47 against a wall and you
experience it one way.
9196.73 But were you to
shed that wetsuit,
9198.68 you go, wow, there's
this incredible landscape
9201.14 of somatosensory experience
that I had no idea.
9204.71 It goes way beyond
levels of sensitivity.
9206.66 Right now you're talking about
fine two point discrimination
9209.16 and light strokes,
and this could
9210.59 be positive or negative
pain in other ways too.
9213.23 But what you're
describing is essentially
9215.12 that the wetsuit was
never really there,
9217.88 but was created through
a series of action steps.
9221.9 And I think what we're
migrating towards here
9224.3 is a set of for most,
non-intuitive or non-reflexive
9231.2 action steps that reveal
to us that in fact, we're
9235.25 not wearing the wetsuit.
9236.72 Now, you raised one
topic, which I think
9240.542 is analogous to
this wetsuit, which
9242.0 is this notion of distraction.
9243.47 That normally, distraction is
masking what would otherwise
9246.11 be a better experience of life.
9251.65 I can think of
distraction as falling
9254.05 into two different bins.
9255.4 One would be the
kind of distraction
9257.38 that is internally generated.
9259.06 Like, the fact that
thoughts arise and pull me
9261.46 down different alleyways
and avenues of my brain
9265.06 and my thoughts
and my experience.
9269.26 And that would compete
with my ability
9272.02 to really focus on something.
9274.83 And then another
form of distraction
9276.84 which captures my ability
to focus intensely
9280.62 but has me focusing
on the wrong things.
9283.17 And here, I think
the judgment of wrong
9286.08 is reasonable to include
if, for instance, I'm
9289.65 being impulsively yanked to
something on social media.
9294.6 I'm being impulsively yanked
to someone else's pain
9296.85 and experience and
somehow confusing
9298.62 that with my own experience.
9300.12 This isn't empathy but
just being yanked around.
9302.29 My attention as a spotlight
is kind of like over
9304.29 here, over there.
9305.16 I'm not feeling
as if I'm the one
9306.945 standing behind that
spotlight controlling it
9308.82 or I'm not the spotlight,
just to keep with what
9311.913 we've been building up here.
9313.08 So could you tell us a
little bit about distraction
9316.8 and tell me whether
or not these two
9320.08 forms are in any way
accurate or inaccurate?
9323.17 I'd be happy for them
to be inaccurate.
9324.868 And whether or not there are
other forms of distraction
9327.16 that we need to be
on the lookout for.
9328.85 And again, I think
what most people
9331.21 are seeking is, what is the way
to not just enhance our ability
9334.48 to focus but to shed this
wetsuit-like cloak that limits
9338.8 our experience that I'm
calling and that you've
9341.14 called distraction?
9342.685 SAM HARRIS: Yeah, distraction
is one component of it.
9347.99 The other aspect of it is
identification with thought.
9351.64 And the feeling of self
is bound up in the sense
9355.33 that I'm the thinker,
I'm the one attending,
9359.03 I'm the one vulnerable.
9360.61 I'm the inner homunculus that's
vulnerable to experience.
9365.66 And it can be
gratified by it or not,
9367.96 and it's constantly trying
to improve it or mitigate
9371.32 negative aspects of it.
9373.945 It's the sense that
there's kind of a rider
9376.163 on the horse of
consciousness as opposed
9377.83 to just consciousness
and its contents.
9380.42 So again, it rides atop this
illusion of control, et cetera.
9386.6 So to go all the way back to the
question you asked about, just
9391.72 what is in it, what I
recommend as a starting point
9395.11 for meditation.
9398.797 Some of your assumptions
are, in fact, true.
9400.63 Yes, I often recommend
at the beginning people
9403.51 close their eyes and you
do a sitting practice
9406.42 and it's different from
a walk in practice.
9408.5 I mean, you can do
both, but people
9409.958 tend to start sitting
with their eyes closed.
9413.2 But again, ultimately
where this is going
9415.87 is it's not an art
of-- meditation
9419.35 properly recognized is not
an artifice that you're
9422.05 adding to your life.
9423.37 It's not even a practice,
it is less rather than more.
9428.71 And therefore, it is also
coincident with potentially
9433.63 every waking moment.
9435.7 There's nothing that you
can do with your attention
9439.52 once you know how to meditate.
9440.77 That in principle
excludes meditation
9443.65 because meditation
is just a recognition
9447.58 of an intrinsic character of
consciousness in each moment.
9450.693 And all you have
in each moment is
9452.11 consciousness and its contents,
whatever you're doing.
9457.14 So in the beginning, you'll be
very deliberate and precious
9461.55 about deciding to
practice meditation,
9464.032 and you'll set aside 10
minutes in the morning,
9465.99 and you'll do that.
9467.28 And it'll seem very different
from the next 10 minutes
9469.65 when you're spilling
out onto your to-do list
9473.31 and you're trying to figure
out what the day looks like.
9476.28 But ultimately,
you want to erase
9479.28 this boundary between formal
practice and the rest of life
9481.89 such that it's just
not remotely findable.
9488.959 And that's achievable.
9490.95 And I think even from
the very beginning,
9492.69 you can relax this conceptual
distinction between meditation
9495.99 and its antithesis, because it's
not at the level of anything
9500.49 you're doing, it's at
the level of what's
9505.68 happening in your
relationship to thought.
9507.99 Like, what can you notice?
9510.81 It's + transition from
the by-stable percept.
9516.62 You're looking at the
image and you see nothing.
9521.5 Let's say it's the
Dalmatian, it's
9523.51 just the spots on the paper.
9524.71 And you don't see anything.
9527.15 And then all of a sudden the
Dalmatian or the face of Jesus
9529.69 or whatever the image is
pops out and then you see it,
9533.83 it's the transition from
nothing to something.
9536.83 The practice becomes
the transition
9538.63 from being lost in thought
and then waking up.
9543.43 And breaking the
spell of thought,
9547.69 and identification of thought
is very much like waking up
9550.9 from a dream and having--
9554.71 it's like that transition.
9557.23 Like you're having a
dream and couple of things
9562.645 are true there.
9563.27 I mean, it's a psychosis
that is just not--
9569.03 we don't problematize
because you're safely in bed
9571.12 and you're not moving
or unless you've got
9572.87 some kind of sleep disorder.
9575.12 You're not walking
around harming
9577.01 yourself or anybody else.
9579.23 But to be in bed
and to not know it
9582.95 and to think you're
running along a beach
9585.71 or you're getting tried for
murder in a court of law
9589.04 or whatever the
thing is that you're
9590.57 completely delusional
about, that is psychosis.
9593.78 And it's like
you're fundamentally
9595.49 unaware of your circumstance.
9596.9 And then two things
can happen there.
9598.73 You can either become lucid
within the dream, which
9601.73 is interesting, and there's
a whole phenomenology
9604.07 of that which can be practiced.
9607.22 But more commonly,
you can just wake up
9609.53 from the dream and
all of a sudden,
9611.51 the problem you thought
you had is no longer there,
9615.48 and you have a completely
different context
9618.17 for your conscious life.
9619.97 Now, you know you're safely
in bed all the while.
9623.57 There really is
something analogous
9626.66 when you break this
identification with thought.
9629.81 You're having a
thought that seems
9632.09 to be some kind of moral or
psychological emergency and yet
9645.04 the moment you see
daylight around,
9646.78 the moment you see
that the mind is larger
9650.08 than this mere appearance,
then suddenly you
9654.91 have a degree of freedom
that a moment ago was
9657.4 just unthinkable.
9658.57 And you recognize, you
sort of come to in a way,
9663.19 you recognize your
circumstance in a way
9665.117 that you weren't a moment ago
when you were just talking
9667.45 to yourself, when you were just
identical to that conversation.
9671.48 So this is all to say that
ultimately, meditation--
9677.05 I mean, so again, there's
another apparent paradox here.
9679.91 Many people who don't
know much about meditation
9681.91 will say things
like, well, for me,
9685.5 running is my meditation
or skiing or rock climbing
9689.16 or playing the guitar
or something they like
9691.98 to do that gives them an
experience of flow, that's
9696.06 what they go to feel better
and that's the opposite of all
9699.27 the chaos of their lives
or their time on Twitter
9703.38 or whatever it is.
9707.17 And virtually every
case, it's not
9709.3 true to say that that is
effectively meditation.
9712.18 By learning to play
the guitar, you're
9713.77 not going to learn what
I'm calling meditation.
9716.89 And you're not going
to learn it by cycling
9719.65 and getting-- no matter how good
you get at any of those things,
9722.38 you're not going to learn
it by doing those things.
9724.505 But paradoxically, I
mean, not really, but it
9728.72 can seem like a paradox.
9729.86 Once you know how to
meditate, then you
9732.29 can meditate doing
all of those things.
9734.39 Meditation is totally compatible
with playing the guitar
9736.73 or skiing or doing any
ordinary thing you like to do.
9740.75 So once you know
how to meditate,
9743.09 and again, it's totally
natural in the beginning
9745.28 to formalize it and to set
aside time each day to do it
9748.46 because it is a training.
9749.693 I mean, it is something
that in the beginning,
9751.61 you have to get used to.
9752.74 But once you're
getting used to it,
9756.24 then there is no good reason
not to be experiencing
9759.62 this thing I'm
calling meditation,
9761.57 this insight into the center
looseness of consciousness,
9767.33 the non-selfhood
of consciousness.
9771.53 You should experience
it when you're
9774.74 playing your favorite
sport or when you're having
9777.08 a conversation with somebody.
9780.6 Then to come back to
your initial assumption
9782.88 about eyes closed,
a lot of practice,
9786.67 even formal practice
can be done eyes open.
9789.15 And it's important
to do it as open
9791.1 because so much of our
anchoring of our sense of self
9794.43 is based on visual cues.
9796.24 I mean, we know that you
can if you give people
9799.14 the right visual cues,
you can translocate
9801.937 their sense of self.
9802.77 You can give them an
out-of-body experience
9804.84 with a video display,
where you can literally
9808.02 make them feel like there's
a body swapping illusion.
9811.398 You can make them feel that
they're in another person's
9813.69 body looking back
at their body if you
9816.96 run the cameras the right way.
9818.31 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've done this
in VR, seeing an image of--
9821.34 they create an avatar
for you and then
9822.93 your bodily movements generate
the movements of the avatar,
9825.78 and you start gaining presence
as they call it in the VR lingo
9830.52 very quickly.
9831.51 And then pretty
soon, you lose sense
9834.87 of your own bodily
representation.
9837.12 And it's a little eerie.
9839.52 What's eerie is to me
is going back into,
9843.78 of course never left, but back
into your actual body when
9847.11 the VR goggles pop off.
9848.82 The world seems
almost overwhelming
9850.65 the number of
sensory stimuli that
9852.66 are in a laboratory room,
which is actually quite sparse.
9857.1 So exactly what
you described, this
9858.69 translocation of notions of
self through visual experience.
9862.62 SAM HARRIS: But
conversely, when you
9864.12 lose the sense of
self, the sense of self
9866.76 I'm talking about,
it can be especially
9869.49 vivid and salient
with eyes open.
9872.82 Because so many of your
reference points to selfhood
9876.09 are delivered
visually, especially
9878.46 in a social situation.
9879.58 So like, I'm talking to you,
you're looking back at me.
9882.69 So the implication
of your gaze is
9885.42 that I'm over here behind my
face implicated by your gaze.
9890.28 So the sense that you're
looking at something
9893.28 is the sense of self
in that social context.
9896.58 And if your facial expression
changes, I'm saying something
9899.79 and if you kind of
furrow your brow, like,
9902.13 what the hell is he-- and I can
read into that facial change,
9905.07 some interstate of yours
that is salient to me.
9908.25 All of a sudden, we've
got this sort of dance of.
9910.5 Like, I'm noticing
you reacting to me,
9913.08 and that's changing the way
I'm feeling about what I'm--
9917.59 That's the purview of
every neurosis everyone
9921.6 didn't want, right?
9922.56 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
every relationship.
9924.227 I had a girlfriend when I was
a post-doc who was very, very--
9928.32 she was brilliant,
really, still is.
9930.6 And she always said that
every relationship, there
9934.035 are four arrows.
9934.95 She used to say she's a
neuroscientist, still is.
9937.08 And said there's the arrow of--
9940.206 she was talking to me,
so she said, me to you
9942.735 and kind of what you
perceive coming from me.
9944.61 And then there's
you to me, and then
9945.93 there's an arrow from the middle
going right back at of each one
9948.72 of us, which is our
own perception of what
9950.617 the other person is
thinking about us,
9952.2 and it's feeding back
on the other arrow.
9954.0 And she gave me this
very clear but model
9957.72 of basically relationships.
9960.3 The relationship failed, but
it was good while it lasted,
9962.91 I should say.
9965.25 But the four arrow
model of relationships
9967.68 actually shows up in every type
of one-on-one relationship,
9971.64 and is probably an
under description
9973.26 of the total number of arrows.
9974.79 But is I think it's exactly
what you're describing
9976.29 is that perception of self
through the eyes of other
9978.66 whether or not we're empathic
or not strongly shapes
9981.45 the way that we access
different context dependent rule
9983.75 sets about what we're
going to say or not.
9985.5 And it's very dynamic, right?
9987.072 SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
9987.78 But the freedom that I think we
want and people can sometimes
9992.7 experience this
just haphazardly,
9994.39 but the center of the bull's
eye from the meditative point
9997.59 of view is to get off that
ride entirely and to--
10002.15 so that losing the sense
of self in this context
10004.88 of a social encounter is to
give up your face, essentially.
10013.58 And what that entails
is or what that gives
10018.56 you is the free attention to
actually just pay attention
10022.58 to the other person.
10023.69 And the other person
is now no longer quite
10026.78 an object in the
world for you, there's
10029.66 really just a kind of a totality
of which that person is a part.
10036.16 And actually, Martin Buber,
the mystical Jewish philosopher
10043.06 talked about the
I-thou relationship.
10045.25 And I think it's been a long
time since I've read Buber.
10048.34 But and I don't know
if he goes far enough
10052.24 to be truly non-dualistic, but
there's distinction between I
10055.42 and thou because the thou
part of it is, I think,
10060.67 potentially this.
10062.55 Again, it's been several
decades since I read him.
10066.13 But there's a way of
beholding another person where
10071.95 you have the free attention
to simply behold them.
10077.44 You no longer care what
they think about you.
10080.83 You don't feel neurotically
implicated by their gaze.
10084.79 You don't feel-- you're simply
the space in which they're
10088.6 appearing, and so you're free.
10094.6 So by definition, you're
no longer self-conscious.
10100.57 And this phrase,
self-consciousness, really
10102.4 does get at this,
what I'm calling
10105.85 the self, the illusory self
as a kind of contraction.
10109.33 And you can notice
this for yourself.
10111.61 Just imagine what
it's like to go
10115.51 from not being self-conscious to
suddenly being self-conscious.
10119.74 And the proximate
cause of this almost
10124.12 invariably is suddenly
recognizing that somebody
10128.11 is looking at you.
10129.1 It's like you're in a
Starbucks and you're alone
10131.935 and you're reading the
newspaper or whatever it is.
10134.06 And this now sounds
highly anachronistic.
10136.75 It's been three years since
I've held a physical newspaper
10139.84 in a Starbucks.
10141.43 But you're just minding
your own business.
10144.37 And you look up,
and you're seeing
10147.4 a room full of strangers.
10149.36 But then you notice that
someone is just looking at you.
10153.46 And so that moment
of eye contact,
10156.25 suddenly that throws you back on
yourself as a kind of suddenly,
10160.6 you're the object in the
world for that other person.
10163.99 That recognition is
the tightening there,
10169.73 the kind of contraction there
is a further ramification
10176.51 of this feeling most of us
have most of the time of being
10182.9 the center of experience.
10186.935 It's like we're all
walking around with a fist.
10189.95 And in moments of
self-consciousness,
10191.69 the fist gets really tight.
10193.82 And that's the thing that gets
fully relaxed when you discover
10199.07 this, what in various point's
called the nature of mind
10203.87 or the non-dual nature
of consciousness.
10206.69 It's just that there is no
center to this experience.
10209.63 And when you
recognize no center,
10211.97 then even when your gaze is
aimed at another person's gaze,
10215.96 there is no implication
going back to the center
10218.615 because there is no center.
10219.74 And rather than that being an
experience of weird detachment
10225.41 or confusion, it's
actually an experience
10229.76 of greater relationship because
you're no longer defending it.
10234.82 You're not defending
anything over here.
10237.35 You're not braced
against anything,
10239.24 you're just the space in which
that person is showing up.
10242.73 And so it's an
experience of being
10246.14 much more comfortable in the
presence of another person,
10250.58 whatever your relationship,
because you're not contracting.
10256.19 Again, and this is meditation.
10257.66 This is meditation that is
totally compatible with having
10260.18 a conversation with somebody.
10262.31 And then when you notice
your self contracting,
10264.86 when you notice you're
not meditating anymore,
10268.76 you're actually reacting.
10269.84 Like, they just said something
or looked a certain way
10272.21 and now, you're cast
back upon yourself
10275.21 in relationship to
them, that becomes
10279.1 a kind of mindfulness alarm.
10281.11 Then it becomes the
unsatisfactoriness of that.
10287.05 Psychologically becomes
more and more salient.
10293.33 Because one, that's not
the way you want to be.
10295.947 I mean, it's like,
it's the antithesis
10297.53 of it being as comfortable
as you were a moment ago.
10300.62 But two, it's something
you're doing unnecessarily.
10306.54 it's like, again, you're
making a fist when
10309.07 you don't have to make a fist.
10313.02 Again, you can leave aside
all those circumstances
10315.18 where it's appropriate
to react to someone.
10317.31 And I'm into martial
arts and self defense.
10320.7 And yes, you're not supposed
to be just this puddle of goo
10323.58 out in the world who can be
just mistreated by people
10326.01 and never put up resistance.
10328.65 But it's psychologically
even if a state like anger
10336.43 or contraction is sometimes
normative and appropriate,
10340.9 the question is, how long is it
normative and appropriate for?
10344.725 How long do you want
to stay angry for?
10347.95 In my experience, these kind of
classically negative emotions
10352.67 like anger and fear are
appropriate as salience cues.
10357.77 They orient you to an emergency
or a potential emergency.
10362.57 But then in dealing
with the emergency,
10365.63 they're almost never the
state you want to be in.
10370.1 Like, it's better to actually be
calm in an emergency in a way.
10374.72 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, absolutely.
10377.12 And again, the language is
insufficient to describe
10380.88 what you're telling us.
10382.22 But I think what
comes to mind for me
10384.74 is this distinction between
situational awareness
10387.38 and self-awareness.
10388.34 And we need both
but under conditions
10391.31 of emergency, true emergency,
or motivated desire.
10397.79 We need to dial down the
amount of self-awareness
10403.7 in order to be more effective
within the situational
10406.28 awareness.
10407.48 But you said something
very important.
10409.58 And my lab has been
working on fear-like states
10412.31 for a long time, so I confess
I'm going to rob this from you,
10416.045 but I'll credit you
every time I describe it,
10417.92 is that the fear of the
threat detection state
10423.89 or set of events acts
as a flag but is not
10428.45 meant to persist in the
way that the flag went up
10432.26 if one is to be in their
most adaptive state.
10435.41 Actually, Jocko Willink and
I were talking about this.
10437.66 He talks a lot about detachment
and open gaze, things
10440.24 that my lab is interested in
visual system and autonomic
10442.73 interactions.
10443.43 So why broadening
the gaze literally
10445.64 broadens the time
domain of thinking
10447.365 and you come up
with new solutions
10449.42 to complex problems in
real time and so on.
10453.32 And you're describing
an everyday set
10455.42 of interactions where
that could be very useful.
10457.43 And yet, there seems to be
something that about the way
10461.48 you describe meditation and
what you've managed to arrive at
10465.17 and what practitioners of
meditation can arrive at,
10468.74 which is something
more than that.
10471.09 It's not just about being
effective or optimizing,
10473.997 all the language we see thrown
around a lot in the space
10476.33 that I live in these days, but
something fundamentally more
10481.64 important about how to
experience life and the self.
10487.07 This realization
that what you thought
10489.14 was there was
never really there,
10491.09 but that there are
constraints that limit that.
10494.67 And so to try and fracture
those constraints one by one.
10498.65 Would you say that
meditation as a practice done
10501.26 for a few minutes each day
or with the app, that it's
10503.66 kind of a step function?
10505.49 Is it very non-linear in
terms of people's progress?
10510.44 I'm certainly going to go start
doing more meditation based
10514.97 on this discussion, truly.
10516.56 Because any time
someone describes
10519.23 that there's kind of a myth
that we've been living in,
10523.7 I become obsessed with the
idea of dissolving that myth.
10527.15 That's a very seductive
phrase, so thank you
10529.76 for using that one.
10530.563 There is no better
marketing tool,
10531.98 which is I realize what
you're not trying to do here.
10534.188 But that's for me to
capture my efforts.
10537.05 You tell me that there's
a myth that I'm living in
10539.58 and that it can be
dissolved, and that opens up
10541.97 a better landscape.
10544.61 What is the process like?
10546.74 Do some people make
progress very quickly?
10549.32 Do some people experience
kind of step functions
10552.89 towards progress?
10554.12 What does the meditation
practice look like over time?
10558.95 Do you still meditate or
have you just threaded it
10561.17 through your jujitsu, your
writing, your daily life,
10564.06 your coffee, your time
with your wife, et cetera?
10566.465 SAM HARRIS: Yeah,
also just to come back
10569.24 to talk about the
myth for a second.
10570.74 So what you just enunciated
was a kind of a second doorway
10574.61 into this whole project.
10576.0 So like, the usual door is
through the door of suffering,
10581.787 for lack of a better word.
10582.87 When people feel unhappy in
a variety of ways and they
10586.77 get more sensitized
to the mechanics
10588.66 of their own unhappiness.
10590.04 And meditation is
one of the things
10592.41 on the menu that
is explicitly built
10595.05 as a remedy for unhappiness.
10598.83 And it is.
10599.52 And that's I think
that's probably
10601.29 the most common path to this.
10602.67 But another path is just
intellectual interest.
10605.562 I mean, just wanting
to know what's
10607.02 real about the mind subjectively
in a first person way.
10611.94 And there's no contradiction
between those two things,
10614.25 and I'm motivated
by both of them.
10615.67 But it's a totally
valid doorway into this.
10622.49 There are definitely
step functions.
10623.99 I mean, I would say
there are at least two,
10628.1 and they really are
articulated along
10631.88 the lines of the
framework I've been
10635.06 describing of dualistic and
non-dualistic mindfulness.
10638.75 So in the beginning,
you're going to start out--
10641.81 99.9% of people will start out
dualistically paying attention
10646.46 and noticing the difference
between being distracted
10648.74 by thought and then being
on the object of attention,
10652.71 whether it's the breath
or sounds or whatever.
10655.41 And eventually, that opens
up to all possible objects
10659.0 of attention,
including thoughts.
10661.07 And there's still
this fluctuation
10662.93 between being distracted and
then being mindful of whatever.
10667.52 And the fact that it's open
to all possible objects
10670.22 differentiates this
type of practice
10671.99 from anything that is
narrowly focused on one
10674.33 object like a mantra
or a visualization
10677.06 as I was just saying.
10679.01 Those are other
paths of practice
10680.78 that are more
concentration-based and
10683.52 interesting.
10684.02 But the benefit of mindfulness
is that very quickly, you
10689.01 realize it's by definition
compatible with all possible
10691.53 experience, because
you're not artificially
10695.07 contracting your attention
down to something,
10697.32 you're just being aware
of the next thing.
10699.57 A sight, a sound,
a taste, a thought.
10703.62 So the first step function
is to very clearly experience
10709.55 the difference between
being lost in thought
10712.46 and being clearly aware
of any part of experience,
10715.95 including thought.
10716.96 And to notice the freedom,
the comparative psychological
10721.52 freedom that gives.
10722.81 So something's made you
angry and now you're
10725.893 thinking about all
the reasons why
10727.31 you should be angry and
have every right to be angry
10729.477 and what you're going to tell
that person when you see them,
10732.47 and then you notice
you're thinking.
10734.42 And you notice the connection
between the thought
10737.12 and the anger.
10738.23 Like, the minute spent lost
in thought about what's
10742.76 making you angry
is the thing that
10744.89 dragged through the
physiology of anger.
10749.27 And the moment you notice
that once you're mindful,
10753.17 once you can be mindful, you
can notice thought as thought
10756.2 and how quickly that dissipates.
10758.57 That's just the language
and the imagery.
10760.46 You couldn't hold on
to it if you wanted to.
10762.9 And then you notice the
physiology of the anger
10765.08 is just this kind
of meaningless,
10770.09 kind of inner incandescence
that has its own half
10772.89 life and degrades very,
very quickly when you're
10774.89 no longer thinking
about the reasons
10776.39 why you should be angry.
10777.59 You can't hold on to the anger,
the anger itself dissipates.
10781.46 And from the point of view of
the one who's being mindful,
10784.79 this is tremendous relief.
10786.53 And at minimum, it's
a degree of freedom.
10788.6 You can at that point
decide, well, how long
10791.57 do I want to be angry for?
10793.07 Is it useful to stay angry?
10794.25 Do I want to be angry for
one minute, two minutes, five
10796.542 minutes, 10 minutes?
10798.02 And before you have that
capacity to be mindful,
10801.74 you're going to
helplessly be as angry
10803.488 as you're going to be
for as long as you're
10805.28 going to be that way
just based on the time
10808.91 course of your thinking
about it, brooding about it,
10811.1 telling your wife about it.
10814.412 It's just going to be this
conversation-based misadventure
10818.09 in negative states
of mind, and you
10823.94 are going to be the
hostage of that for as long
10826.04 as you'll be the
hostage of that.
10827.415 You have nothing
you can do apart
10829.43 from just deciding to check
out and watch Game of Thrones
10832.73 again for the third time.
10834.65 You can divert your attention
to something else, which is
10838.46 sometimes a good thing to do.
10840.29 But mindfulness, even
dualistic mindfulness
10843.26 gives you this capacity to just
observe the mechanics of this
10848.09 and then get off the
ride whenever you want.
10852.4 So that really is
a step function.
10853.98 First, there was a time
before you could do that,
10856.83 and then there's a time
after which you can do that.
10860.11 The other step function
is noticing that there
10865.22 is no one who is doing that.
10867.38 I mean, this is the
non-duality, the selflessness,
10870.5 the centralessness of awareness.
10872.54 The fact that there's no place
from which the mindfulness is
10875.27 being aimed but the
fact that there's just
10878.15 this open condition in which
everything is appearing,
10880.82 thoughts included.
10883.39 To have you at that point, your
mindfulness no longer becomes--
10889.94 it's no longer this
dualistic effort
10894.71 to strategically pay
attention to anything
10897.89 as opposed to being
lost in thought,
10900.44 it's just what's left when
the present recognized
10906.71 thought unravels.
10908.6 Even before it unravels,
what's recognized
10911.18 is you are simply identical
to the condition in which
10914.99 everything is appearing.
10916.59 Now, again, I'm not making
a Deepak Chopra-like
10922.1 metaphysical claim
about the mind.
10924.86 I'm not saying the mind isn't
what the brain is doing,
10927.53 and I'm not saying
that you're recognizing
10929.477 the consciousness that
gave birth to the universe.
10931.56 I'm not making any broad
claims about metaphysics,
10934.97 I'm just talking about as
a matter of experience.
10939.36 There is just this condition in
which everything is appearing.
10942.533 And what you're
calling your body,
10943.95 again, as a matter
of experience--
10945.367 I'm not saying that we
can't have third person
10948.03 conversations about physical
bodies in the physical world.
10951.39 But as a matter of
experience, the only body
10954.09 you're ever going to directly
encounter as your own
10958.71 is in appearance
and consciousness.
10960.66 So consciousness is
not in your body,
10964.12 what you're calling your
body is in consciousness.
10967.17 Visually, proprioceptively,
it's like everything is just
10970.98 appearing in this condition.
10972.22 And again, this
is not a spotlight
10976.32 that you're aiming
at the body, there's
10979.62 just this condition in which
everything, including anything
10983.25 you could call
yourself is appearing.
10985.06 And so yeah, the
second step function
10991.01 is to recognize that
this is already true.
10996.09 Consciousness is already
without this thing
10998.16 you've been calling your
ego and hoping to unravel it
11002.99 through meditation.
11005.74 Consciousness is not going to
get any more selfless, any more
11009.1 centerless, any freer
than it always already
11011.86 is recognized as such.
11014.99 And so the step
function at that point
11018.73 is your mindfulness
at that point,
11021.41 the thing you come back to when
you're no longer distracted
11024.2 is that recognition
again and again.
11026.57 And then it becomes compatible
with anything you would do.
11030.78 And so to answer
your question, yes,
11032.36 I still practice formally,
sometimes, frequently.
11037.61 But I definitely miss days
and I don't do it for--
11041.93 I mean, I don't rule
out the possibility
11044.51 that I will go back on
retreat at various times
11047.12 just to check in with that and
see if that makes a difference.
11050.24 But I tend to sit for--
11057.42 I mean, I've designed
my life so that I
11060.84 can spend a lot
of time meditating
11064.08 without having to be
formally meditating.
11066.07 Like, so, I'll go for
a hike for two hours.
11069.263 And what I'm doing
when I'm hiking
11070.68 is identical to what I'm doing
when I'm quote, "meditating",
11073.62 sitting in a chair, doing
nothing but meditate.
11078.36 So yeah, I'm very
interested in erasing
11086.22 the boundary between what
people are calling meditation
11089.37 and the rest of life.
11090.52 And so in teaching
these things, I
11093.782 tend to emphasize that
from the beginning
11095.49 because I think it's
very easy to set up--
11103.93 to get gold by a
bunch of assumptions
11106.87 that cause you to be
very split in your sense
11111.52 of what your life is about.
11113.11 And I'm sort of banking
my meditation over here
11116.65 because I'm meditating two
hours a day diligently,
11119.41 and it's going to be
really good for me.
11121.72 And then over here, this is the
rest of my life, which is not
11125.85 nearly as wise or as
useful or as like,
11129.0 this is the stuff that is
still the area of my problems.
11132.16 And I think it's useful to
recognize you've got one life,
11139.37 and you've got this single
condition of consciousness,
11143.75 and its contents in
every mode of life.
11146.37 And there's something
to recognize about it.
11148.61 And you're always free
to recognize that.
11150.62 And truly even in your dreams.
11152.81 I mean, it never stops.
11155.18 So that's what I
tend to emphasize.
11157.803 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
earlier, you told us
11159.47 that meditation is not
about changing the content
11162.68 of conscious experience.
11164.0 And in a different
podcast that you were on,
11167.09 I heard you say something to
the effect of that normally we
11171.32 are in our daily experience
and unless we are trained
11173.81 in meditation, unless
we've dissolved
11177.35 this illusion of the gap between
actor and self and observer,
11184.55 that we require certain sensory
events to create collisions
11191.0 within us and with the natural
world that sort of blast us
11194.99 into a different mode of being.
11198.21 I want to use that
as a way to frame up
11200.6 this idea that some things
such as psychedelics
11204.44 but also a very long hike,
a very long fast, who knows?
11211.52 A banquet, different
types of life experiences
11215.09 do exactly the opposite of what
you're describing meditation
11218.27 does, which is
that they actively
11220.55 change the content of
our conscious experience
11223.34 so much so that we
often remember those
11225.41 for the rest of our lives.
11228.5 Could you tell us why
psychedelics can be useful?
11234.51 And here, I'll give the
caveats that maybe you'll
11236.66 feel obligated to give as well,
but we're talking about safely
11240.47 and responsibly,
age-appropriate,
11242.54 context-appropriate, ideally
with some clinical or other
11246.2 type of guidance, legality
issues, obeyed, et cetera.
11250.13 All that stated, it
was psychedelics to me
11253.46 are an experience of
altered perception,
11256.97 internal and external
perception, altered space time
11259.82 relationship,
somewhat dreamlike.
11261.44 I think it was Alan Hobson at
Harvard for a long time talked
11263.69 about the relationship between
psychedelic-like states
11265.94 and dream-like states because
of this distortion of space time
11270.47 dimensionality.
11272.63 And I haven't experimented
with them much.
11277.61 I've been part of a clinical
trial, three doses of MDMA,
11280.58 which certainly
altered the quality
11283.52 of my conscious
experience in ways
11285.26 that led to a lot of
lasting and at least for me,
11287.63 valuable learning.
11289.203 So what are your what are your
thoughts about psychedelics
11291.62 in terms of how they
intersect with the discussion
11293.84 that we've been having?
11295.37 And what utility do they play
in recognition of the self
11300.17 or in other sorts
of brain changes?
11303.1 SAM HARRIS: Well so, let's
just price in all those caveats
11307.52 that people can anticipate.
11310.84 These drugs are not
without their risks.
11312.88 And one problem is that we
have this single-term drugs
11318.31 or psychedelics, which
names many different types
11320.92 of substances, and
they're not all the same.
11323.2 So like, MDMA is not even
technically a psychedelic.
11327.49 I think it has immense
therapeutic value,
11329.98 and it actually
was my gateway drug
11331.9 to this whole area of concern.
11335.185 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Amphetamine pathogen, right?
11337.062 It's a sort of an
amphetamine and a pathogen
11338.895 at the same time.
11339.34 SAM HARRIS: Yeah, I mean
it's, often called--
11341.08 ANDREW HUBERMAN: M pathogens.
11341.395 SAM HARRIS: Yeah,
and a pathogen--
11342.91 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not a
pathogen, M pathogen.
11345.235 SAM HARRIS: And a pathogen or
an entactogen, it's been called.
11350.08 But it doesn't tend to
change perception in the way
11352.9 that classic psychedelics do.
11354.43 And it's also serotonergic,
but it has to be in some part
11360.76 differently.
11361.87 And even LSD and psilocybin,
which are much more similar
11365.57 and classic psychedelics,
both are also serotonergic
11368.53 but they're not merely,
and they're also different.
11372.73 And the higher dose you take
of these drugs, the more--
11375.76 at lower doses everything,
can kind of seem the same.
11378.94 At higher doses, they
begin to diverge.
11385.35 And we can talk about the
pharmacology if you wanted to.
11388.7 But I would just say
that for many of us,
11394.12 and certainly for
me, psychedelics
11396.43 were indispensable in the
beginning in proving to me
11401.11 that this was--
11404.98 the first person interrogation
of the mind was worth doing.
11409.66 Because I was somebody
who at age 17 or 18,
11414.46 before I had any real experience
with MDMA or LSD or psilocybin,
11424.0 if you had taught me how
to meditate at that point,
11426.61 I think I would have just
bounced off the whole project.
11430.24 I think I was so cerebral
in just my engagement
11438.4 with anything.
11439.36 I was so skeptical of any of
the religious and spiritual
11445.27 traditions that have given us
most of our meditation talk
11452.17 that I think I just would have--
11454.45 And I know many of these people.
11456.37 I have tried to teach Richard
Dawkins to meditate and Daniel
11459.707 Dennett to meditate.
11460.54 I've ambushed them
with meditation
11463.0 both in a group
setting and one-on-one.
11466.12 Not Dan but Richard, I
ambushed on my own podcast
11470.62 with a guided meditation.
11472.36 And he closes his
eyes, he looks inside,
11480.65 and there's nothing
of interest to see.
11485.63 He doesn't have the
conceptual interest in him
11491.47 that would cause him to
persist long enough to find out
11495.25 that there's a there there.
11496.99 Now, this is not a problem
with LSD or psilocybin or MDMA.
11503.07 I know that if I gave
him 100 micrograms of LSD
11506.22 or 5 grams of mushrooms or
25 milligrams of psilocybin--
11513.973 that's probably not
the analogous dosage
11515.64 to the 5 grams of mushrooms.
11516.84 5 grams of mushrooms
would be more than that.
11522.18 I forget what it is of
MDMA, maybe 120 milligrams.
11526.265 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think
the maps dose, which
11528.57 is the one that's under clinical
trials is 125 milligrams
11531.66 with an option of a
75 milligram booster.
11534.39 Funny, I remember it.
11535.53 SAM HARRIS: Yeah,
that's strange,
11536.905 the facts that come to hand.
11539.55 But there's just no
possibility that nothing's
11545.19 going to happen right now.
11546.3 Something with a psychedelic,
with MDMA, most people
11550.35 tend to have certainly
under any kind of guidance,
11552.48 tend to have a very positive,
pro-social experience.
11558.66 But with a
psychedelic, you might
11561.24 have a somewhat
terrifying experience
11567.74 if you have quote, a bad trip.
11569.66 And I've certainly
had those experiences
11571.4 on LSD and to some
degree, on psilocybin.
11575.03 But the prospect that
nothing is going to happen
11579.74 is just in nearly a million
cases out of a million just
11585.2 not in the cards.
11586.02 I mean, just
neurophysiologically,
11588.74 something is going to happen
with the requisite dose of one
11591.89 of these drugs.
11593.51 And if that thing that
happens is psychologically
11599.51 at all normative and pleasant
and interesting and valuable,
11604.5 which it is so much of
the time and certainly
11606.89 under the appropriate set
and setting and guidance,
11612.32 it can be a lot of the time
for virtually everybody.
11616.88 Again, there are caveats.
11618.785 If you're prone,
if you think you
11620.21 have a proclivity for
schizophrenia or bipolar
11624.83 disorder, this is almost
certainly not for you.
11628.7 And anyone doing the
studies at Johns Hopkins
11632.0 for the therapeutic effects
of any of these drugs,
11636.2 they're there ruling
out people with--
11638.42 first degree relatives with any
of these clinical conditions.
11645.25 So for somebody
like me at 18 who
11649.81 didn't know that this was
an area of not only interest
11655.18 but would it be the
center of gravity
11658.09 for the rest of his life, if
only he could pay attention
11661.09 clearly enough to
see that it could be,
11665.2 I was someone who very likely--
11667.24 again, I don't have the
counterfactual in hand.
11669.358 I don't know what
would have happened
11670.9 if someone had
forced me to meditate
11673.36 for an hour at that point.
11674.92 But I know I wasn't interested
in it until I took MDMA.
11682.35 I know I wasn't having
these kinds of experiences
11684.72 spontaneously that
showed me that there
11688.05 was an inner landscape
that was worth exploring.
11691.65 I was a very hard-headed skeptic
who was very interested in lots
11695.25 of things, but there was no
alternative to me just thinking
11699.63 more about those things.
11700.95 I mean, the idea that there's
some other way of grasping
11705.12 cognitively at the
interesting parts of the world
11710.4 beyond thinking about the
world, that just wouldn't
11714.75 have computed for me at all.
11719.7 No one ever gave me a book
to read or I never had--
11724.92 The noun, meditation,
very likely
11727.83 meant absolutely nothing to me
before I took my first dose of,
11733.59 in this case it was MDMA.
11736.44 So what the drug experience
did for me is it just proved--
11742.62 So one of the
limitations of drug
11745.38 is that, obviously, no matter
how good the experience,
11748.47 the drug wears off
and then you're
11750.12 back to in more or
less your usual form,
11754.65 and now you have a
memory of the experience.
11757.32 And it can be a
fairly dim memory.
11758.855 I mean, some of
these experiences
11760.23 are so discontinuous with
normal waking consciousness
11763.717 that it can be like
trying to remember
11765.3 a dream that just degrades
over the course of seconds.
11769.74 And then it could have been the
most intense dream you've ever
11772.47 had and for whatever reason,
you can barely get a purchase
11775.65 on what it was about.
11777.132 And there are some
psychedelic experiences
11781.32 that are analogous to that.
11782.47 But for most people
most of the time,
11785.22 there's a residue
of this experience.
11787.02 And with something like MDMA,
they can be quite vivid.
11792.44 Where you recognize there
was a way of being that
11797.0 is quite different than what I'm
tending to access by default,
11800.87 and it is different
in ways that are just
11810.1 obviously better and
psychologically more healthy.
11813.76 I mean, it's possible to
be healthy psychologically
11817.6 in a way that I never imagined.
11821.62 And then when you link it up
to the traditional literature
11826.84 around any of this stuff,
again, so much of it
11829.6 is shot through
with superstition
11832.57 and other worldliness
of religion.
11834.49 And as you know and I think
you're listeners probably know,
11838.9 I've spent a lot of time
criticizing all that.
11841.06 But there is a baby in the
bathwater to all of that.
11844.27 It's not that somebody
like Jesus or the Buddha
11849.76 or any of the matriarchs and
patriarchs of the world's
11853.03 religions, it's not that they
were all conscious frauds
11857.02 or temporal lobe epileptics,
there's a pathological lens
11863.2 that you can put
on top of all that.
11865.825 But once you have one of these
experiences on psychedelics
11869.68 or on a drug like MDMA, you
know that there's a there there.
11873.76 You know that unconditional
love is a possibility.
11877.06 You know that feeling
truly one with nature.
11883.57 I mean, just so one
with nature that you
11886.33 could spend 10 hours
in front of a tree
11889.27 and find that to be the
most rewarding experience
11891.79 of your life.
11893.92 That's a possible
state of consciousness.
11895.735 Now, it may not be the
state of consciousness
11897.61 you want all the time.
11898.863 You don't want to
be the crazy guy
11900.28 by the tree you
know who can't have
11902.05 a conversation
about anything else.
11904.76 But once you have one
of these experiences,
11908.66 you recognize, OK, there's
some reason why I'm not having
11914.01 the beatific vision right now.
11916.08 And I can't even figure out
how to aim my attention so as
11919.44 to have anything like it.
11921.04 And that's a problem,
because it's available,
11924.48 and it is among the best things
that has ever happened to me.
11930.78 And now I can just only dimly
remember what that was like.
11934.86 So how do I get back
there on some level?
11938.01 So that invites, again,
a logic of changes.
11941.76 A logic of seeking changes in
the contents of consciousness,
11945.55 which sets someone up for
this protracted or seemingly
11951.99 protracted and fairly
frustrating search
11955.53 to game their
nervous system so as
11959.13 to have those kinds of
experiences more and more.
11963.87 And again, it's not that
that's in principle fruitless
11967.32 but it is from the point of
view of the core insight,
11971.97 the core wisdom of
what I would take
11974.1 from a tradition like
Buddhism, which is not
11976.99 the only tradition that
has given voice to this,
11978.99 but I would argue it's
given it voice to it
11981.54 in the most articulate way.
11985.08 Again, leaving aside
any of the superstition
11987.96 and other worldliness
and miracles that we
11992.16 don't have to talk
about at the moment.
11993.82 And you certainly don't
need to endorse in order
11995.82 to be interested in this stuff.
12000.56 And so that's the
bifurcation between all
12006.03 of the utility of
psychedelics and what
12008.43 I'm talking about under
the rubric of meditation
12012.15 is at this point of OK, once you
realize there's a there there,
12016.53 what do you do?
12017.4 And what's the logic by
which you're led to do it?
12020.13 And it's possible if
you're only framework
12023.37 is the good
experiences, the good
12026.1 feels you had on
whatever drug it was
12029.7 and a further discussion of
what that path of changes
12037.89 can look like--
12039.24 and that can become in
a religious context,
12041.13 it can come in just a
purely psychedelic context
12043.73 or some combination of the two.
12048.19 I think you can be
misled to just seek
12054.43 lots of peak experiences.
12055.708 You're just trying
to string together
12057.25 a lot of peak experiences hoping
they're going to change you,
12060.37 every one of which,
by definition is
12063.34 going to be impermanent.
12065.17 It's first it wasn't
there, then it's there,
12067.48 and then it's no longer there.
12069.05 And then you've
got a memory of it.
12072.17 What I think what
everyone really
12074.56 wants whether they know it or
not, and they're right to want,
12077.47 is a type of freedom that
is compatible with even
12082.33 ordinary states of
consciousness, which
12085.03 can ride along with them
into extraordinary states
12088.15 of consciousness.
12089.09 So I hadn't done
psychedelics for 25 years
12092.8 because, again, they were super
useful for me in the beginning,
12096.1 then I discovered meditation on
the basis of those experiences,
12101.23 got really into
meditation and realized,
12103.0 OK, this is a much more--
12108.16 conceptually, this makes
much more sense to me.
12110.26 This is delivering the goods
in terms of my experience.
12115.6 There's no need to
keep having these--
12117.4 seeking these peak
experiences with drugs.
12121.21 But it had been 25 years
since I had done that
12124.03 and there was this resurgence
in research on psychedelics.
12126.73 And I was being asked
about psychedelics,
12128.89 and I was talking about
their utility for me,
12131.05 but again, these were
distant memories.
12133.39 And there was also one type
of psychedelic experience
12136.75 I was aware that
I had never had.
12138.4 I had never done a high dose
of mushrooms blindfolded.
12142.85 Every mushroom trip
I'd ever had I'd
12144.46 been out in nature
and interacting with--
12147.77 it's just been a very
transformed sensory experience
12150.4 of the world and
of other people.
12153.31 But I'd never done it
alone, blindfolded,
12155.23 just purely inwardly directed,
and at a high dosage.
12159.73 I'd done high doses of
LSD but not mushrooms.
12166.72 So I did that and
it was very useful.
12170.08 And I spoke about it on my
podcast, and there's actually--
12173.23 I think if you search
"Sam Harris mushroom
12175.48 trip" on YouTube, you
get the 19 minute version
12178.03 of my describing that trip.
12180.82 It was incredibly useful,
but what was doubly useful
12185.05 was my mindfulness training in
the context of that explosion
12191.29 of synesthesia.
12192.67 I mean, it was such an
overwhelmingly strong
12195.28 experience, and there
were so many moments where
12201.55 it could have gone
one way or the other
12203.41 based on my sense
of just, OK, I'm
12208.42 going to try to resist this.
12210.52 It was in truth irresistible
because it was just so much,
12213.8 but there were moments where
I was aware of, OK, this is--
12220.15 letting go of self
in this context
12224.8 is the thing that
is going to make
12230.227 the difference between
heaven and hell
12231.81 here because there
are experiences that
12234.48 are so extreme
that you can't even
12237.03 tell if it's agony or ecstasy.
12240.18 Everything is turned up to 11.
12242.04 And the difference
between the two is--
12246.18 the tipping point is just--
12248.37 really it's a high
wire act in some sense.
12250.8 You could just fall to
one side or the other.
12254.43 Yeah, so what I think
people want is--
12260.57 they certainly want
to be able to extract
12262.4 from the psychedelic
experience, wisdom
12265.88 that is applicable to ordinary
states of consciousness.
12268.65 It's like, what is the
thing you can realize
12271.22 in a moment of
having a conversation
12272.93 with your child that
isn't distracting you
12276.74 from that relationship?
12278.07 It's not a memory of
when the world dissolved
12280.79 or when you were
indistinguishable from the sky,
12284.36 but it's just a way of
having free attention
12289.16 and unconditional
love in this totally
12294.71 ordinary and potentially
chaotic human experience, which
12300.02 can be psychologically
fraught and you
12302.48 can meet iterations
of yourself that you
12305.24 don't like that
are not equipping
12307.19 you to be the best possible
person in that relationship.
12310.64 And what we want to do is
cut through all of that
12314.42 and actually be in
love with our lives
12319.04 and with the people in our
lives more and more of the time.
12322.26 And I'm not saying that repeated
psychedelic journeys can't
12331.75 be integral to that
project, but you
12334.57 know that the project can't
be being high all the time.
12339.31 So whatever is extractable from
the occasional psychedelic trip
12344.86 has got to be manageable into
ordinary waking consciousness.
12348.16 And the real point of contact
does run through this--
12353.36 what I've been calling
the illusion of the self.
12355.6 And again, that part
is discoverable without
12360.13 any changes in contents.
12362.41 So you don't have to suddenly
feel the energy of your body
12366.43 rush out and be continuous
with the ocean of energy that
12370.48 is not your body.
12372.25 That's an experience
that's there to be had,
12374.17 I mean, there's no doubt.
12375.58 But the truth is just
looking at this cup
12384.26 is just as formless and
as mysterious as that when
12389.42 seen in the right
way, and that's
12392.12 what meditation encourages
one to recognize.
12396.57 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
share the experience
12399.08 that MDMA significantly
altered my perception of what's
12403.97 possible in terms of an
emotional stance towards self
12407.3 and others, including
animals, something that
12410.42 runs very deep for me and that
I had been actively suppressing
12413.48 in anticipation of having
me put my dog down.
12415.52 But also, I don't know how
to frame it except to say,
12420.05 my lab did animal
research for years,
12421.76 and I was always very conflicted
about it because I love animals
12424.743 and yet I wanted to
understand the brain
12426.41 and we need to work on
animal brains, and we--
12430.55 SAM HARRIS: Rodents or what?
12431.72 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'll
be very direct about this.
12433.97 I've worked on many species.
12435.8 I've worked on mice and rats.
12440.99 Admittedly, I've worked on--
12442.28 I've done some cat experiments.
12443.99 I've worked on large, non-human
primates including macaques.
12448.61 I no longer work on
any of those species.
12451.4 I've worked on cuttlefish,
cephalopods, a discussion
12455.66 for another time, brilliant
little creatures, maybe
12459.47 as smart as us, or who knows?
12461.9 Maybe smarter.
12462.98 And now I work on humans
because I couldn't reconcile
12467.93 the challenge inside me,
which was my love of animals
12471.32 and working on them.
12472.2 I just couldn't
do it any longer.
12473.9 And MDMA didn't set
that transition,
12477.32 that transition actually
had been set a lot earlier.
12479.93 It's something I
really grappled with.
12481.52 It didn't keep me up at
night, but it was always
12483.56 in the back of my mind.
12485.21 In any event, I hope
what we discovered
12486.86 was worthwhile, but this
that's a bigger debate.
12490.85 And I've strong
feelings about this,
12492.47 and maybe it's a topic
for another podcast.
12496.52 But I'm very happy that
now I work on humans,
12499.37 and they can tell
me if they want
12500.75 to be part of the
experiment or not,
12502.25 and I trust them and
I trust their answers.
12506.54 I think that MDMA, in its role
as an pathogen, I think really
12510.77 did set an understanding
of what's real and true.
12513.77 So I think truths
like that become--
12517.34 I felt that they didn't
hit me square in the face.
12520.34 The feeling behind the
conflict made itself evident,
12524.057 and what to do about
it made itself evident.
12525.89 So I suppose MDMA did
assist the transition
12529.04 to purely human research, as
opposed to animal research.
12532.658 The other thing that
I noticed it did
12534.2 is it made it not
scary to confront
12538.28 things that were scary to
confront in my conscious life.
12541.243 And I could think about
things in my conscious life,
12543.41 but it brought
them close in a way
12545.81 that I could get closer
and closer to the flame
12547.82 and then gain some
understanding.
12549.32 I'm still amazed at how answers
arrive, both during the session
12556.46 and in the weeks and
months that follow if one
12558.668 puts the attention to it.
12559.71 I think that's why
it's important to have
12561.418 a guide of some sort
or to have some pseudo
12563.81 structure because otherwise
one can get attached
12568.16 to the sounds in the room.
12569.48 And there's probably
meaning there,
12571.77 but I wanted to do
some deeper work.
12573.65 I have not had experience
with psilocybin, at least
12576.02 not since my youth.
12576.862 And I don't recommend
young people do it.
12578.57 I regret doing LSD and
psilocybin as a young person.
12580.948 I don't say that for politically
correct reasons or liability
12583.49 reasons, I just think my
mind was not developed.
12586.94 But I'm intrigued by something--
so here's the question--
12591.27 how is it that psilocybin
in particular and high dose
12593.78 psilocybin and the ego
dissolution that people
12596.66 talk about on psilocybin--
how do you think that lines up
12601.7 with some of the
experiences that you've
12604.31 been describing for a
adequate meditation practice?
12607.64 Because that's something that
I did not experience on MDMA.
12610.46 In fact, if anything, I
experienced for the first time
12613.67 what really feeling like
a isolated container was,
12618.62 and the difference-- and how
empathy and being bounded--
12621.385 having, in other words,
good boundaries and empathy
12623.51 could be symbiotic.
12624.497 I experienced that for
the first time there.
12626.33 And I do think that
there is learning inside
12628.52 of these states that
translates into everyday life
12630.8 when one is not on these states.
12632.588 And the last thing
I'll say is, no, I
12634.13 don't feel the impulse to go
and do 20 more MDMA sessions.
12638.84 I think the three as
part of this study
12641.75 were very effective for me.
12645.08 As I say, if you hear the
calling again you might do it,
12647.78 but I'm very curious about
psilocybin in particular
12650.9 and this notion
of ego dissolution
12652.94 because we've been
talking about the self.
12654.92 SAM HARRIS: Well, so
there are different ways
12657.65 In which the sense of self
can be eroded or expanded.
12664.24 There's lots of experiences that
can still have a center to them
12668.47 but be very novel
and transformational.
12674.77 And one can reify
those as a goal state.
12680.05 There's a concept in Buddhism
that I think is useful.
12683.16 It doesn't translate
well to English,
12686.52 or it can set up false
associations in English
12691.29 that are unfortunate.
12692.28 But so there's a concept of
emptiness in Buddhism, which
12696.99 sounds, again, gray and
dispiriting in English,
12699.63 but it's cognate terms are
things like unconditioned,
12712.15 unconstrained, open, centralist.
12721.81 When I'm talking
about non duality,
12723.4 when I'm talking about the
loss of a sense of subject
12726.19 and then what's
left, in Buddhism,
12728.41 they would often describe
what's left as emptiness.
12730.84 But an emptiness
is not a something.
12735.88 Importantly, it's not
the same thing as unity,
12739.69 so it's not a oneness
because it's--
12746.13 When the center drops
out of experience,
12748.86 it's not like you are
suddenly merged with the cup.
12754.65 Now, granted, this is
where psilocybin and other
12758.91 psychedelics can give
a false impression of I
12762.54 think what the goal is.
12763.83 You can have seeming
merging experiences--
12767.1 you can have unity experiences
on psychedelics, which
12770.04 can be quite powerful,
especially with other people
12774.312 and with nature,
where you can just
12775.77 feel the energy of
your body becomes
12785.27 incredibly vivid and powerful.
12787.31 It's like everything is just
buzzing with life energy.
12792.41 And then when you touch
another person's hand
12795.32 or you touch a
tree, there can be
12798.41 this continuity of
energy, which can be
12801.38 this overwhelming experience.
12803.53 And again, this is
a 20 megaton change
12807.95 in the contents
of consciousness.
12809.78 This is a non ordinary
state of consciousness.
12814.76 To give some indication
of how this happens--
12819.05 back in the day
when I was in my 20s
12822.44 and I was experimenting with--
12824.09 this was LSD, but
some friends and I
12827.212 had decided-- we had
this brilliant idea.
12828.92 We would camp above Muir woods
and then take some LSD at dawn
12834.38 and then walk down like a
mile I think from the campsite
12838.19 into the actual
proper grove of trees
12841.28 and commune with the giant
redwoods, the tallest
12844.4 trees on Earth.
12846.285 And so we dropped the acid at
dawn, and we start walking,
12848.66 but the acid came on
almost immediately.
12851.21 And we didn't get--
12852.08 I mean, we got nowhere
near the woods,
12853.73 and we got stopped by
a tree that was just
12855.98 like an ordinary
20 foot oak tree,
12858.823 the most boring
tree in the world.
12860.24 And that tree absorbed
the next six hours
12863.09 of our conscious attention
because it was just--
12866.12 it was the tree of life.
12867.17 I mean, there could
be no better tree.
12870.26 So we're talking about
nonordinary states
12872.15 of consciousness wherein
a merging with life
12876.86 and with the world is possible.
12881.72 So I'm not saying that kind
of experience isn't possible,
12885.09 but there's a sort of
expanded self reification.
12891.5 It is a kind of ego dissolution,
but there's a kind of egoity
12896.45 that goes along for
the ride as well,
12899.48 or can go along for the ride.
12900.86 And the real insight into
emptiness, the real centerless
12906.29 center of the bull's eye is a
recognition that in some ways
12912.86 equalizes all experiences.
12914.72 And again, it's just
as available now
12917.57 in this ordinary
podcasting experience
12921.29 as it is when you're merging
hands on with an oak tree,
12926.57 and on 400 micrograms of acid,
and this is the whole universe.
12935.04 And so it's the equality
of those two experiences
12940.58 that this concept of
emptiness captures, which
12943.7 a concept of oneness doesn't
quite capture because oneness
12947.09 is really this peak experience
of being dragged out
12950.81 of your somethingness into
a much bigger somethingness.
12955.79 Emptiness is just
no center and then
12959.09 everything is in its own place.
12961.13 There's still sights, and
sounds, and sensations,
12963.83 and thoughts, and feelings, but
there's no there's no center
12967.52 and there's no
clinging to anything.
12971.51 There's no clinging
to identity, there's
12973.37 no clinging to the good
stuff, there's no there's
12975.83 no resistance to the bad stuff.
12978.34 So pleasant and unpleasant
get strangely equalized,
12982.1 and it's very expansive.
12986.24 And most importantly, it
doesn't block anything.
12989.87 So yeah, if for whatever
reason if your nervous system
12992.21 is set up to have
the, oh my god, I'm
12996.17 now merging with the
tree experience, that's
12999.26 possible from the
state of no center.
13002.38 And on my recent--
13005.11 now not so recent,
three years ago, it
13006.955 was right before COVID,
but my last big psychedelic
13011.71 experience, I was very
much experiencing that.
13016.88 Whereas, insofar as I--
13020.69 at the peak, there was no me
to remember any of this stuff.
13024.59 But insofar as I could
experiment with--
13029.6 is this really different
from anything else?
13031.88 There is a equalizing to
the emptiness recognition,
13036.77 even in the presence of
a completely transformed
13041.24 neurophysiology.
13044.3 Again, there's a
point of contact.
13046.19 I mean, the real point of
contact between psychedelics
13050.36 and meditation for me is--
13052.46 but for my experiences
on psychedelics,
13054.632 I think there's
just no way I would
13056.09 have had the free attention to
be interested in the project
13060.2 at all.
13062.188 And there are other
aspects to the project.
13063.98 It's not just having this
insight into selflessness,
13067.28 it's all of the ethical
ramifications of that.
13069.92 It's just like, what kind
of person do you want to be?
13072.17 What are your values?
13074.48 What is a good life,
altogether, when
13077.18 you are talking
about relationships,
13080.15 and political engagement,
and the changes you can
13083.3 make in the world or not make?
13085.4 It's just, what kind of
person do you want to be?
13087.59 There's a much
larger consideration.
13090.41 And I mean, as you discovered,
an experience on MDMA
13095.18 can really both expand your
model of what is possible,
13103.33 and what is desirable,
what is normative.
13105.13 I mean, just what kind of self
do you want to be in the world?
13108.67 And it can also help
you cut through things
13112.93 that are inhibiting
your actualizing any
13116.26 of those possibilities in
ordinary waking consciousness.
13119.913 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've certainly
found that to be the case.
13122.33 I mean, you raise a really
important point, which
13125.05 is that once these
learnings take place,
13129.497 these understandings
take place inside
13131.08 of psychedelic journeys--
13132.94 I do believe they translate
to neuroplasticity.
13135.31 I do want to highlight
the point for people.
13137.71 Oftentimes people
say, oh, you know,
13139.96 this mushroom or
this psychedelic
13144.25 it opens plasticity, but
of course, plasticity
13147.01 has to be directed someplace.
13148.33 Plasticity is just a process
like walking or anything
13151.78 else, underlying neural process.
13153.68 And I think it's
impossible for me
13156.04 to understand what
compartments of my life
13158.44 have been impacted by
these three MDMA sessions.
13161.87 But in some ways, I
wonder whether or not,
13164.967 not just the transition
away from animal research,
13167.05 but also a deeper
realization of the love
13171.28 for learning and
sharing information.
13174.04 I won't go so far as
to say this podcast
13176.11 is happening because of
that particular session,
13179.14 but these things they splay
out into multiple domains
13182.62 of the self.
13183.25 And I do think that
the key features that
13186.88 feel most important
to me to mention
13189.04 are that it really identified
true loves, things that I truly
13194.71 love, and made me less
cautious about feeling
13199.97 how intense those
loves really are.
13201.92 And then also lowered
the inhibition point
13206.15 of exploring, well,
what would that mean?
13209.235 And one of the reasons
I bring this up,
13210.86 and why I think it's so
important that you mentioned
13213.47 some issues around
politics and ethics
13215.888 and that many things
have splayed out
13217.43 from your exploration of
psychedelics, meditation,
13220.46 neuroscience, philosophy,
all the things that are you,
13223.25 and of course, that's only
a subset, is that so much
13227.36 of what I hear and see, so
much of what I hear and see
13231.2 in the self-help space,
contradicts itself and leads
13237.49 back to the origin
without a lot of progress.
13242.38 For instance, we
hear absence makes
13244.45 the heart grow fonder but then
out of sight, out of mind.
13246.94 You hear about
radical acceptance,
13248.92 but then what if it's radical
acceptance of non acceptance?
13252.303 I mean, there are
some experiences
13253.72 in people for which I radically
accept the fact that I
13256.42 want nothing to do with them.
13258.88 Am I supposed to transcend that?
13260.4 So these are the questions I
think that keep a lot of people
13262.9 from exploring things like
meditation because they
13267.4 feel like, well, is the idea
to just be OK with everything?
13270.61 Is radical acceptance
just like--
13272.68 we'll just bulldoze me
with things even if they--
13276.61 and my goal is to
somehow surpass
13279.46 the idea that they're harmful.
13280.785 And I don't think
that's actually
13282.16 the way any of this stuff
is supposed to work,
13284.26 although I don't claim to be
the authority on it either.
13288.22 I think notions of
radical acceptance,
13290.95 and radical honesty, and any
number of different sayings
13294.67 that one can find out there are
really the most salient beacons
13298.75 and guides that most people have
in order to try and navigate
13301.63 tough areas in their
life, including
13303.88 the relationship
to self, but others
13305.68 and political orientations.
13307.36 And so I feel like
almost all those things
13309.64 can be used to anchor down in
a stance that may or may not
13312.52 be informed or to
open up to ideas.
13316.7 And so I think that
none of this can really
13320.17 be solved in a single
practice it sounds like,
13322.27 but it does seem to me, based
on what you've told us today,
13326.14 is that only through a deep
understanding of the self
13329.62 as it really is, as
opposed to this illusion
13333.52 that you framed up,
could we actually
13336.82 arrive at some
answers about what's
13338.41 actually right for each
and every one of us.
13340.845 SAM HARRIS: Yeah,
I mean, there's
13342.22 one generic answer that
I think can be extracted
13345.88 both from psychedelics
and from meditation
13350.71 and from just
thinking more clearly
13352.45 about the nature of our lives.
13354.67 And it's to become
more process oriented,
13359.23 and to be more and more
sensitive to the mirage
13365.53 like character of
achieving our goals.
13369.91 Now, I'm not against
achieving goals.
13371.83 I have a lot of goals.
13373.66 I'm very busy.
13374.257 There are lots of things
I want to get done,
13376.09 and I'm satisfied as
anyone to finish a project.
13381.13 But if you look at
the time course of all
13384.16 of that fulfillment and--
13388.84 there are a few lessons
everyone I think has to draw.
13391.18 One is, most of your life
is spent in the process.
13395.47 The moment at which the goal is
fully conquered, that is just--
13400.75 I mean, that has
a tiny duration,
13404.44 and it has a very
short half life.
13410.53 The moment you arrive
at it, it begins
13413.89 to recede because,
in the meantime,
13415.97 you have all these
other goals that
13417.43 have appeared on the horizon.
13419.2 You've got people asking
what you're going to do next,
13422.08 and in some sense, if
you're focused on goals,
13426.94 you can never arrive.
13429.19 And I think what we're
all looking for in life,
13437.15 whether we're ever
thinking about taking
13439.45 psychedelics or practicing
something like meditation,
13443.83 we're looking for
good enough reasons
13447.22 to let our attention
fully rest in the present.
13453.61 That is the logic of success.
13456.97 The sense like, I've got all
these things I want to do--
13459.49 if I could just get rich
enough, or fit enough,
13461.92 or dial in my sleep well enough,
or improve my life in all
13465.45 of these ways, get the
right relationship,
13467.2 wouldn't it be
great to be married,
13468.85 I want to start a family,
I want all of these things.
13473.39 Why do I want these things?
13475.33 I want these things because
I'm telling myself--
13478.96 all of those things
are wonderful,
13480.64 I'm not I'm not discounting
those relative forms
13483.43 of happiness or
sources of happiness
13486.01 because it's all
completely valid,
13487.57 it's completely valid
to want those things.
13489.362 But one thing is
absolutely clear,
13494.2 it's possible to be miserable
in the presence of all
13497.2 of those things.
13498.4 And you can add great wealth,
and fame, and everything
13501.79 on top of that, and It's
possible to be absolutely
13504.13 miserable having everything
anyone could seemingly want.
13509.267 You just have to
open a newspaper just
13510.85 to see people living
out that predicament--
13513.61 spectacularly wealthy, famous,
healthy, successful people
13517.6 who could do anything they
want in life, apparently,
13520.06 and yet they're
doing this thing that
13522.16 is completely dysfunctional
and making them needlessly
13524.77 miserable.
13526.24 I won't name names,
13527.77 ANDREW HUBERMAN: There's
enough of them out there.
13528.61 SAM HARRIS: Some people
come to mind at the moment.
13533.64 So there is a clear dissociation
between having everything
13538.77 and happiness that's possible.
13540.75 And it's also possible to
have very little, and almost
13544.5 nothing, and to be quite happy.
13546.75 I mean, you might not
have met these people,
13549.06 but I have met people who have
spent 10 years alone in a cave.
13554.78 And they come out of
that cave not floridly
13557.39 neurotic or psychotic,
they come out
13559.34 of that cave beaming
with compassion and joy.
13562.28 And I mean, they've been taking
MDMA for 10 years, essentially,
13565.52 and they come out
of the cave and now
13567.38 they're going to talk about it.
13570.86 And I'm not necessarily
recommending that project
13572.94 to anyone.
13573.44 I'm just saying, that is a
psychological possibility.
13575.96 So you have a double
dissociation here,
13577.73 whether you can have
everything and be miserable,
13579.772 or you can have nothing and
be beaming with happiness.
13584.1 So what is it that we actually
want in all of our seeking
13587.69 to arrange the
props in our lives
13589.91 and to have a
convincing enough story
13593.96 to tell about ourselves that
we're doing the right thing?
13597.74 What is all of that
effort predicated on?
13600.5 It's predicated on this
desire and this expectation
13606.35 that if we could get all of
this stuff in the right place
13610.88 and not have anything
terrifying to worry about,
13613.79 everyone we love is healthy for
the moment, and we're healthy,
13617.06 and we've got something to
look forward to on the weekend,
13619.77 and there's not a
plumbing leak in the house
13623.625 that we have to
immediately respond to,
13625.25 and we like our house, and
our career is going fine,
13628.94 and there's something
good to watch on Netflix,
13631.29 and we have all of it, now
can we just actually give
13636.79 up the war?
13637.83 Can we fully locate
our sense of wellbeing
13642.76 in the present moment?
13644.41 Can we relax the impulse
to brood about the past
13649.27 or think anxiously about
the future for long enough
13652.84 to discover that all
of this here is enough?
13657.25 Because our life our life is--
13660.79 we have this finite
resource of--
13663.76 I mean, we absolutely have
the finite resource of time,
13666.86 but within this the
finite continuum of time,
13671.08 we have the even more
precious resource
13673.36 of free attention that can find
our fulfillment in the present.
13684.76 Because even if we're even
if we're guarding our time
13687.55 to do the things that
are most important to us,
13690.02 we can spend all of that
time regretting the past,
13695.64 or anxiously
expecting the future,
13699.51 and just bouncing
between past and future
13702.54 in our thinking about
ourselves and our lives,
13704.73 and basically just
dancing over the present
13708.0 and never making
contact with it.
13709.83 So I think what we want
is a circumstance where
13715.78 a tension can be located in the
present in a way that's truly
13718.9 fulfilling.
13719.41 And unless you have had
some kind of radical insight
13723.92 that allows you to
do that on demand,
13727.71 you are in some sense hostage to
the circumstances of your life
13733.26 to do that for you.
13734.86 You're constantly
trying to engineer
13737.94 a state of the world
that will propagate back
13741.12 on a state of self
that will make
13743.58 the present moment good enough.
13745.41 And what meditation does, and
psychedelics to some degree
13749.25 does this, but meditation
very directly does this,
13752.91 it reverses the causality
and lets you actually
13758.37 change state such that
you can be fulfilled
13761.19 before anything happens.
13764.01 Your happiness is
no longer predicated
13766.11 on the next good
thing happening.
13768.1 You can be in the presence
of the next good or bad thing
13771.0 already being fulfilled
and already being at peace.
13775.07 I mean, there's a--
13778.753 I think there are
misleading nouns
13780.17 we can throw at
what is left there,
13782.12 but it is tranquility, peace,
freedom, lack of contraction,
13790.34 lack of conflict.
13791.24 I mean, all of that can be
more and more of a default.
13794.88 And all of that is also
compatible with deciding, yeah,
13799.16 why not get in shape?
13800.66 Why not engage this project?
13802.58 Why not change your career?
13804.89 I mean, it's not it's not that
you need to be somebody who--
13808.76 I mean, to your
point, you can notice
13811.07 all of these non optimal
things because no matter
13813.32 how much you meditate,
you're very likely going
13817.16 to spend a lot of your time
still lost in thought, still
13821.54 identified with it,
and still caring
13824.75 about the difference between
dysfunction and normativity
13829.533 in your life.
13832.64 The question is, what can you
what can you locate when--
13838.86 the question, it's
like, how much can you
13841.92 puncture that seeking happiness
project with the recognition
13848.4 that you're already free?
13851.94 That's what meditation
makes possible.
13853.98 You can keep just
1,000 times a day
13857.37 letting some daylight
into this search space.
13861.81 But it is still compatible.
13864.45 I mean, working out
is a great frame
13869.67 in which to look at
this because, I mean,
13872.01 in working out, when
you really work out--
13874.95 I'm thinking mostly of--
13876.397 I mean, it's really
anything, but it's
13877.98 resistance training, or cardio,
or something like jujitsu.
13881.73 You're intentionally
putting yourself
13884.13 in classically unpleasant
circumstances, physiologically.
13888.93 I mean, imagine what it's like
to do anything to failure.
13897.25 Well, if you just
check in on what
13899.05 that is like at the level
of sensation, I mean,
13901.45 that is basically-- it feels
like a medical emergency.
13904.93 If you were having
that experience
13906.45 for some other reason,
like if you woke up
13908.2 in the middle of
the night and felt
13909.82 what it feels like
to be deadlifting
13912.28 on your 10th rep on a set
where you would fail at 11,
13920.32 that's an emergency.
13922.247 But because you understand
what you're doing in the gym,
13924.58 and you've sought
out, and it's actually
13926.8 something you like doing, and
you can get a real dopamine hit
13932.62 from doing it, what
you're doing when you're
13939.76 doing that is you're owning a--
13942.88 you're actually transforming a
classically negative experience
13951.62 into something that's almost
intrinsically positive,
13954.95 certainly the net
on it is positive.
13960.56 Being able to do
that is more and more
13963.08 the experience of being
actually at peace,
13967.76 even while exerting
really intense effort
13970.91 in one direction.
13972.18 So you can be straining, and
I'm sure physiologically showing
13976.94 a lot of stress, I mean,
I'm sure the cortisol is up,
13979.7 and blood pressure's up,
heart rate is certainly up.
13985.28 So it's like, as far as the
body is concerned, it's stress
13989.447 as far as the eye can see.
13990.53 But you really can
be deeply equanimous
13993.95 and at peace, again, because
of the frame around it,
13996.795 because of the concepts
attached to it,
13998.42 because you know
what you're doing,
13999.878 you know why it's
happening, and you want it.
14003.31 So that's an attitude
you can bring
14005.62 into other stressful things
that take effort to accomplish.
14009.78 And so it's not
that you just need
14011.41 to be a pushover when you
learn how to meditate,
14014.32 or when you take MDMA, or
work on yourself in any
14017.647 of these ways.
14018.23 But what I think
you want to find
14022.74 is you want to find
your point of rest
14025.65 in the midst of any struggle.
14029.307 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I would
say that, certainly
14031.14 MDMA but, and again, I have
less experience with meditation,
14036.03 but they really I think
put us, ultimately,
14038.34 in positions of what can only
refer to as real strength.
14041.58 These can make
what before seemed
14043.8 like impossible
decisions, or even
14046.23 concepts or emotional
states to even think
14048.81 about for any period of
time without deliberately
14051.51 distracting or avoiding
in some other way
14053.95 and be able to lean into
those with open eyes.
14058.53 To me that's my
definition of strength.
14060.463 I don't know what
other people consider.
14062.13 But there's definitely something
real there in each case.
14070.14 This may seem like a divergence
but I and many other people
14074.25 are very curious about a
recent decision that you made,
14077.41 which was to close your
account on Twitter.
14084.26 You still have an Instagram
account I noticed.
14087.81 SAM HARRIS: I mean,
my team manages that.
14089.57 I've never--
14090.26 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a lot
friendlier over at Instagram.
14091.94 I've been there a lot longer--
14092.75 SAM HARRIS: I've
never even seen it.
14094.05 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, it's
pretty good actually,
14095.43 considering-- imagine
what would happen
14097.055 if you did pay attention.
14098.24 They're doing a
good job with it.
14100.59 But your decision to close
your account on Twitter I think
14104.21 grabbed a lot of eyes
and ears, and there's
14106.79 a lot of questions about why.
14108.17 It was a very large account.
14111.41 It correlated with a number of
things that, for the outsider,
14114.32 people might be wondering
about new leadership, people
14120.29 who had been booted off, brought
back on, or at least invited
14123.56 back on, and so on.
14126.05 You are certainly not obligated
to explain your behavior
14129.56 to me or anybody
else for that matter.
14133.58 But I'm curious if you
might share with us
14137.96 what the motivation was for
taking the account down,
14141.5 and how you feel
in the absence of--
14144.32 I mean, your thumbs
presumably are freed up
14147.53 to do other things.
14148.598 SAM HARRIS: Yeah, I was
getting like an arthritic right
14150.89 thumb I think, and I think it--
14152.72 ANDREW HUBERMAN: If
you don't mind sharing,
14153.68 I think there's a
lot of curiosity
14155.27 about you and your routines.
14157.64 You've been very generous
in sharing your knowledge,
14161.93 but also what makes
you tick, what
14165.83 motivates pretty big
decisions like that?
14168.42 It was a major platform for you.
14170.36 SAM HARRIS: Right, yeah, so
it was the only social media
14173.39 platform I've ever engaged.
14174.95 I mean, like you said,
I have an Instagram,
14177.71 I have a Facebook
account, but I've never
14180.86 used those as platforms.
14182.18 I was never on them, I've
never followed people.
14185.81 All the posting has
just come from--
14187.4 it's just marketing
from my team.
14191.18 But Twitter was me, I
mean, for better or worse,
14193.98 and I began to feel
more and more for worse.
14197.54 And it was interesting
because it was very--
14202.1 I've talked about it
a lot of my podcast,
14205.13 about my love/hate relationship
with Twitter over the years.
14208.7 Many good things came
to me from Twitter,
14211.58 and I was following a
lot of smart people.
14214.07 And it had become my newsfeed
and my first point of contact
14219.17 with information each day.
14221.21 And I was really attached to it
just for that reason, just as
14223.85 a consumer of content.
14228.38 And then it was also a
place where I genuinely
14231.35 wanted to communicate with
people and react to things.
14234.68 And I would see some article
that I thought was great,
14237.53 and I would signal boost
it to the people following
14241.76 me on Twitter.
14242.4 And that was rewarding,
and I could literally
14245.51 help people on Twitter.
14246.74 I mean, there are people who
have raised lots of money
14251.39 for on Twitter just by signal
boosting their GoFundMe's.
14254.39 And so I was engaged in a
way that seemed productive.
14261.1 But I was always worried that it
was producing needless conflict
14267.0 for me and was giving
me a signal in my life
14271.38 that I was being lured into
responding to and taking
14275.79 seriously that was
out of proportion
14278.19 to its representation of any
opinion or set of opinions
14282.63 that I should be
taking seriously.
14285.09 So I was noticing that--
14287.22 and again, this
evolved over years,
14288.69 I mean, this long predated
recent changes to Twitter,
14297.86 but I was noticing that many
of the worst things that
14301.97 had happened for
me professionally
14304.19 were first born on Twitter.
14306.02 I mean, just like some conflict
I got into with somebody,
14309.14 or something that I felt like
I needed to podcast about
14311.87 in response to on Twitter.
14315.5 Just so much of it, either
it's genesis was Twitter,
14318.68 or it's the further spin of it
that became truly unpleasant
14326.18 and dysfunctional
happened on Twitter.
14327.8 It was just-- Twitter was
part of the story when
14329.84 it got really bad.
14331.07 And I've had vacations
that have gone sideways
14335.058 just because I got on
Twitter and said something,
14337.1 and then I had
produced a controversy
14338.93 that I had to
respond to, and then
14340.347 I had to do a
podcast about that.
14342.53 And it was just, this is a mess.
14345.05 And so at that
point, I have friends
14349.34 who also had big
Twitter platforms who
14351.92 would say why are you responding
to anything on Twitter?
14356.24 Just tweet and ghost.
14359.96 Joe Rogan--
14360.71 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, post and ghost.
14360.92 SAM HARRIS: sat me down and
tried to give me a talking
14363.95 to, as did Bill Maher.
14366.95 And both of them engage
Twitter in that way.
14368.85 I mean, I think they
basically never look
14370.558 at their ad mentions.
14371.66 They never see whats
coming back at them.
14373.9 They use it effectively, the
way I use, or don't even, use
14377.12 Instagram or Facebook.
14378.18 I mean, I don't even see what's
going out there in my name.
14381.71 And so I could essentially
do that for myself
14384.32 on Twitter, presumably.
14385.61 And I did that for
some periods of time,
14388.91 but then I would
continually decide, OK,
14391.94 now it's all balanced
again, maybe I
14393.74 can just communicate here
because it was very tempting
14396.65 for me to communicate
with people
14398.03 because I would see
somebody clearly
14401.32 misunderstanding something
I had said on my podcast,
14404.54 and I think, why not clarify
this misunderstanding?
14409.64 And my efforts to do that
almost invariably produced a--
14417.65 sometimes it was a meandering
process of discovery.
14422.39 But often, it was just
a stark confrontation
14425.84 with what appeared to me to
be just lunacy and malevolence
14430.79 on a scale that I'd never
encounter elsewhere in my life.
14434.09 I'd never meet these
people in life,
14437.24 and yet I was meeting these
people by the tens of thousands
14441.35 on Twitter.
14441.98 And so the thing that began
to worry me about it--
14446.8 and again, I
understand that people
14448.3 have the opposite experience.
14450.967 I mean, depending on
what you're putting out
14452.8 and the kinds of
topics you're touching,
14455.41 you could have just
nothing but love
14457.06 coming back at you on Twitter.
14459.4 But because I am very--
14462.52 essentially, in the
center, politically,
14464.26 and because this is
now on my podcast,
14467.11 this is not in
the Waking Up app.
14469.57 I'm often criticizing
the far left
14472.57 and criticizing the far right.
14474.88 I'm basically pissing off
everyone some of the time.
14478.27 It's different, if you're
only criticizing the left,
14483.04 no doubt you get
hate from the left,
14484.84 but you have all the people on
the right who just reflexively
14488.5 and tribally are expressing
their solidarity for you,
14493.69 and who are dunking on
your enemies for you
14497.47 and when your enemies
come out of the woodwork.
14500.92 And if you're only
criticizing the right,
14503.518 you get a lot of
pain from the right,
14505.06 but you've got the people
on the left who are tribally
14507.31 identified with the
left, who are just going
14509.44 to reflexively defend you.
14511.72 If you're in the center
criticizing the left as hard
14515.56 as anyone on the right
ever criticizes the left,
14519.4 and you're also criticizing
the right as hard
14522.37 as anyone on the left
criticizes the right,
14525.07 you're getting hate from
both sides all the time,
14527.56 and no one is
reflexively and tribally
14531.31 defending you because you
pissed them off last time.
14534.037 You might be getting
hate from the left now,
14535.87 and the people on the
right agree with you
14537.73 but they can't forget the
thing you said about Trump
14539.95 on that podcast
two podcasts ago,
14543.31 so they're not
going to defend you.
14545.0 And so I basically
created hell for myself
14548.8 on Twitter because it
was just a theater of--
14554.34 it was just pure cacophony
most of the time.
14557.35 And what I was seeing was--
14560.31 I mean, there's no way
there's this many psychopaths
14563.82 in the world, but I was
seeing psychopaths everywhere.
14566.07 I was seeing the most
malicious dishonesty, and just
14571.65 goalpost moving, and hypocrisy.
14576.025 I mean, some of it's
trolling, and some
14577.65 of it's real confusion, and
some of it is psychopathy,
14579.99 but it's like, it was
so dark that I worried
14586.13 that it was actually giving me
a very negative and sticky view
14594.17 of humanity that was--
14597.71 I mean, one, I think it
is inaccurate, but two,
14602.24 it was something that I
was returning to so much
14605.54 because, again, I was checking
Twitter at least a dozen times
14609.562 a day, and I'm sure there were
some days where I checked it
14612.02 100 times a day.
14612.87 I mean, it was, again, it was
my main source of information.
14615.37 I was constantly reading
articles and then
14617.78 putting my own stuff out.
14621.158 That it became this
kind of fun house
14622.7 mirror in which I was looking
at the most grotesque side
14625.7 of humanity and
feeling implicated
14632.99 in ways that were
important because it
14635.99 was reputationally important,
or seem to be important.
14640.62 I know a lot of these people.
14642.35 These weren't just
faceless trolls,
14644.15 these are people with whom
I have had relationships
14647.72 and in some cases
friendships, who
14650.21 because of what, largely,
Trump and COVID did
14654.29 to our political landscape in
the last half a dozen years,
14659.63 we're beginning to
act in ways that
14662.87 seemed starkly dishonest
and crazy making to me.
14667.28 So I was just noticing that I
was forming a view of people
14671.0 who I actually have had
dinner with that was
14673.55 way more negative, based
on their Twitter behavior,
14677.34 then I think would ever be
justified by any way they would
14680.33 behave in life with me.
14682.73 I mean, I was never going to
have a face-to-face encounter
14686.36 with any of these
people that was
14688.49 this malicious, and
dishonest, and gaslighting,
14692.06 and weird as what was
happening hourly on Twitter.
14697.73 And so I just began
to become more
14700.34 sensitive to what this was--
14705.8 just the residue of
all of this in my life,
14708.38 and just how often the
worst thing about me
14713.263 in my relationship with
the people in my life,
14715.18 like just talking to
my wife or my kids,
14717.43 was just the fact that I had
been on Twitter at some point
14721.72 in the previous hour.
14724.52 And there was some
residue of that
14728.125 in my interaction with them.
14729.798 It's like, what are
you stressed out about?
14731.59 What are you annoyed about?
14732.715 What are you pissed off about?
14734.44 What can't you get
out of your head?
14737.32 What is the thing
that you now feel
14739.06 like you need to spend
the next week of your life
14741.55 focused on because it
went so sideways for you?
14745.87 All of that was Twitter.
14748.63 I mean, literally 100%
of that was Twitter.
14750.59 And so I just, at one point,
it was actually on Thanksgiving
14754.69 day, I just looked
at this and I just--
14756.67 I mean, there was very
little thought went into it.
14759.14 I mean, literally,
there was more
14761.59 thought involved in whether I
wanted coffee when you asked me
14766.133 when I showed up here.
14767.05 I mean it was just like,
at a certain point I just I
14769.217 just saw it, and I just
ripped the Band-Aid off.
14773.223 And to answer your
other question,
14774.64 it's been almost
wholly positive,
14777.94 as you might expect given the
litany of pain and discomfort
14781.97 I just ran through.
14782.86 But I mean, it's
surprising to recognize
14789.47 how much of a presence
it was in my life
14793.07 given the sense of
what is now missing.
14795.68 I mean, there's no
question there's
14799.73 an addictive component to it.
14801.02 And when you see--
14801.77 I mean, like when
I look at what Elon
14803.312 is doing on Twitter, forget
about his ownership of it--
14807.32 I've got a lot to
say about the choices
14810.56 he's making for the platform,
but just his personal use of it
14815.0 is just so obviously
an expression of--
14818.095 I mean, I don't
know if addiction
14819.47 is the clinically
appropriate term,
14824.24 but his dysfunctional attachment
to using the platform.
14831.52 Again, forget about changing
it and owning it, but just
14835.61 the degree to which it
is pointlessly disrupting
14839.3 the life of one of the
most productive people
14842.06 in any generation.
14848.09 That was also instructive
to me because I know Elon,
14850.85 and from a friend's eye
view of the situation,
14858.65 it's so obviously
not good for him
14861.2 that he's spending this
much time on Twitter.
14865.13 I just brought that back to me.
14866.75 It's like, well, if
it's not-- if this
14868.34 is what it's doing
to Elon, and he's
14869.84 got all these other
things he could
14871.298 be doing with his attention,
how much of my use of Twitter
14874.91 is actually a good idea and
optimize to my well-being
14878.96 and the well-being of
the people around me?
14882.36 So anyway, there was an
addictive component to it I
14885.53 think, and so when
that got stripped off,
14889.61 I do notice that there's--
14891.92 I mean, there are times
I pick up my phone
14894.47 and I realize this is
like the old me picking it
14896.63 up my phone for a reason that
no longer exists because there's
14899.54 not that much--
14900.89 I have a Slack
channel with my team,
14902.39 and I've got email,
obviously, but it's
14904.97 like, that is not much of
what I was doing with my phone
14909.05 really in the end.
14910.07 And so it's just my
phone is much less
14912.5 of a presence in my life.
14913.65 And so it's almost
wholly good, but yeah,
14919.61 I think there is
some danger in--
14923.08 or some possible
danger in losing touch
14927.07 with certain aspects of
culture, which, again, I'm
14929.17 not even sure--
14929.92 I mean, there's this question of
how much is Twitter real life,
14932.545 and how much is it
just a mass delusion?
14935.14 I don't know.
14936.28 But insofar as it
actually matters
14938.59 what happens on
Twitter, or insofar
14942.73 as I was actually getting
a news diet which I'm not
14945.43 going to be able to
recapitulate for myself,
14947.59 or I'm just not in fact going
to recapitulate for myself even
14951.37 if I could, if any
of that matters,
14954.64 I haven't discovered that yet.
14956.86 I mean, it was taking up an
immense amount of bandwidth
14959.98 and it's impressive.
14961.06 I think I said, it was like
I amputated a phantom limb.
14967.27 It was not a real limb, but it
was this continuous presence
14970.69 in my life that--
14975.81 it's weird, it actually
relates to the concept
14978.06 of self in surprising
ways because I
14980.31 felt there was a part of
myself that existed on Twitter.
14985.62 And I just performed a
suicide of that self.
14989.31 This is ending right
now, there's no residue,
14992.52 there's nothing to go
back and check, it's gone.
14995.43 And I didn't go back
and look at my--
14998.4 what's interesting to
consider is that I'd
15000.32 been on Twitter for 12 years.
15003.58 I don't keep a journal.
15004.69 I mean, Twitter, in
my timeline would
15006.643 have been a kind of journal.
15007.81 I could have gone back
to a specific hour
15009.52 and a specific day and looked at
what I was paying attention to.
15011.84 I mean, that could have
been an interesting record
15013.923 of just who I've
been for a decade,
15015.4 and probably a pretty
humbling record of who I've
15018.31 been for a decade in terms
of the kinds of things
15021.73 that captivated my attention.
15026.525 I didn't even think to
go nostalgically just
15029.96 look at any of that,
or see if any of it
15031.64 was worth saving, or
archiving, or thinking--
15033.71 I just-- delete.
15039.83 And so my actual sense of
who I am and my engagement
15043.79 with my audience, the world of
people who could potentially
15050.5 know me.
15051.28 What does it mean
to have a platform?
15054.46 Where do I exist, digitally?
15056.8 My sense of all of
that got truncated
15061.3 in a way that is
much less noisy.
15067.31 I mean, it's amazing
how much can't
15071.05 get fucked up now in my life.
15073.51 It's like with Twitter,
almost anything could happen.
15078.78 The next tweet was
always an opportunity
15081.48 to massively complicate my life.
15083.88 There is no analogous
space for me now.
15086.8 And so it's what I'm going
to say on your podcast, what
15089.16 I'm going to say on
my own podcast, what
15090.827 I'm going to write next.
15092.37 That's much more deliberative
and the opportunities
15101.63 to take my foot out of my mouth
or to reconsider whether any
15105.56 of this is worth it.
15106.85 Is this the Hill I really
want to die on now.
15111.5 It can be much more considered.
15114.56 I mean, I think all
of that's to the good.
15117.39 But even more important
than that is there's not--
15121.38 I'm not getting this
continuous signal
15123.99 that is always
inviting a response,
15126.49 whether on Twitter, or on my
own podcast, or anywhere else.
15131.92 And it's just much less noisy.
15135.3 I mean, life is much
less noisy and cluttered.
15138.96 And that definitely
feels better.
15143.25 That's 100% better.
15144.893 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm
happy to hear that.
15146.56 I know a number of people miss
you there, but you sound happy.
15150.84 I sense the genuine happiness.
15152.43 And several things
come to mind--
15155.47 first of all, thank you for
sharing your rationale there
15158.97 and how it went.
15159.637 I think for a lot of
people they think,
15161.262 oh, you must have walked
around in circles for hours
15163.53 talking about whether
it was delete,
15165.6 as many good decisions
are executed.
15170.34 I'm a big fan of Cal
Newport's work, deep work.
15172.83 In many ways, Cal's--
15174.45 I've never met him,
but we know each other
15176.58 through the internet space.
15178.23 He's really ahead of his time
with this notion of deep work
15181.92 and limiting distractions.
15183.82 I think he's even got
a book about a world
15185.85 without email or
something, really extreme.
15188.013 SAM HARRIS: So I mean,
he deserves some credit
15189.93 because he had been somewhat
a proximate cause to this.
15193.17 He had been on my
podcast, and he
15194.82 had encouraged me
to delete Twitter
15198.24 because I had been I had been
reaching some kind of crisis
15203.94 point with it prior
to that podcast
15206.04 and so we talked about it.
15207.21 And I had recorded that
podcast but hadn't released it.
15210.75 I actually recorded
the podcast the day
15212.64 before I wound up
deleting Twitter,
15214.882 but I hadn't yet released it.
15216.09 So in my podcast with
him, in the intro to it,
15218.85 I then give a post-mortem
on my deleting it.
15222.03 But he was one of the
last people who was
15224.46 in my head around these issues.
15226.54 And actually, it
was not by accident
15228.51 I had invited him on the
podcast because I increasingly
15231.18 wanted to think about whether
this was totally dysfunctional.
15234.863 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm
a big fan of Cal Newport.
15237.03 And I am on social media.
15238.99 I'm on Twitter.
15239.7 I had some high-friction
interactions there,
15243.84 and I have a process
for dealing with those.
15246.33 I tend to avoid high-friction
confrontations online.
15249.93 But Instagram is a much
friendlier place by the way.
15253.12 If you want to come over
to where the nice kids--
15255.49 the cool kids
actually hang out--
15257.557 SAM HARRIS: Strangely, I'm
not looking for a substitute.
15261.993 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Don't let
me entice you over there.
15264.16 But I think that
this notion of really
15266.91 being able to access what
Cal calls deep work, what
15271.5 Rick Rubin talks about
being able to touch
15274.5 the source of great creativity
and focus on a regular basis,
15278.25 does require that one
have certain types of,
15281.46 and in some cases,
zero interaction
15283.26 with certain platforms.
15285.0 That merely being on a
platform and blocking
15287.7 people that just won't provide.
15289.11 I think a lot of
energy opens up.
15290.625 And I'm fascinated by
this concept of energy.
15292.5 I mean, we only
have so much energy,
15294.27 neural energy, to devote.
15297.27 And in many ways
what you described,
15299.64 there's really I think
striking parallels
15301.74 to what we've been talking about
all along these last hours,
15304.9 which is that sometimes
the thing that
15307.02 feels so powerful, that has
such a gravitational pull,
15311.4 and that we think this is
experience, this is life,
15313.72 this is just the way it is,
actually is an illusion.
15316.29 And when you step
away from it, you
15318.3 realize that there's this whole
other dimension of interactions
15321.42 that was available all along but
that we, for whatever reason,
15326.94 were intervening in by way
of our reflexive, distracted
15329.91 behavior.
15330.58 So I think there's
a poetry there.
15332.79 SAM HARRIS: I was a
hard case, but yeah, I
15335.46 got religion on this point,
and it's a good change.
15339.273 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, Sam, I want
15340.69 to say a couple of things--
first of all, every time
15346.19 you talk I learn
so much, and that's
15350.81 in the dimensions of
neuroscience, even
15352.94 hard core neural circuitry
type stuff, which is my home.
15358.4 When you talk about philosophy,
or meditation, or psychedelics,
15364.93 and even politics, a topic that
I'm woefully undereducated in,
15370.57 but you have this amazing
ability to blend and synergize
15375.297 across things.
15375.88 And I think, today,
what occurs to me
15377.47 is that not only
is that no accident
15379.84 because of your
training, and the rigor,
15381.88 and the depth at
which you've explored
15383.74 these different topics, but
also your openness to it.
15386.71 But I think, at least
for me, above all
15389.53 it's because I think you
are able to encapsulate
15392.56 this idea of the self
and the different ways
15395.68 in which we each and
all can potentially
15398.23 interact with the environment
and our inner landscape.
15403.15 Your description of
meditation, I have to say,
15405.43 now has forever changed the
way I think about meditation.
15409.46 I would no longer just think
of it as a perceptual exercise.
15412.08 On the podcast, I've
been talking about it
15413.83 as something to do for these
various benefits, the benefit
15416.86 set of more focus, lower stress,
of which certainly exists.
15420.79 But what you describe
today, has such an allure
15425.62 and holds such a promise
that, as I mentioned,
15431.47 I'm certainly going
to change my behavior.
15433.24 And I know I'm
speaking on behalf
15434.8 of many, many
people, when I just
15436.9 want to extend my thanks
for your coming here today
15440.41 to teach us even more
because, of course, you
15443.53 have your podcast and the
app, the Waking Up app.
15447.73 And the fact that, regardless
of the political landscapes,
15453.62 regardless of what neuroscience
feels about psychedelics,
15456.83 or where things are
at any point in time,
15459.56 you strike me as somebody who
is very committed to sharing
15463.64 knowledge and thoughtful
deep discourse
15466.91 so that people can benefit.
15468.2 And there are very
few people like you.
15470.86 In fact, there's
probably only just one.
15472.82 And so I feel very
grateful to be
15474.32 sitting across the table from
him for these last hours.
15477.155 SAM HARRIS: Oh, nice, nice.
15478.28 Well, I really
enjoyed this, and I
15480.375 want to congratulate
you on what you've
15482.0 built here because your podcast
is everywhere, and I'm a fan.
15487.16 And even more than
that, I'm continually
15489.92 seeing the evidence of you
reaching people and benefiting
15494.06 people, and this is one of
the best examples of new media
15501.38 just carving out a space
that people didn't really
15505.19 know existed because this is
not television, it's not radio,
15509.54 it's not--
15510.6 and all of a sudden,
people have time
15512.33 to hear a conversation
of great length
15514.55 that goes into nitty gritty
scientific detail on hormones.
15520.4 I mean, who would have thought
that was even possible?
15522.66 And so, yeah, I would
just-- congratulations,
15525.53 it's fantastic to see.
15526.77 And I'm just very happy
for the opportunity
15529.4 to talk to you and your people.
15530.935 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, thank you,
15532.31 it's very gratifying to hear.
15533.54 And I feel very blessed,
in no small part because
15537.17 of our conversation today.
15538.61 Thank you so much.
15539.36 SAM HARRIS: Nice,
well, to be continued.
15540.08 ANDREW HUBERMAN:

today's episode,
15609.35 but on many episodes
of the Huberman Lab
15611.06 podcast we discuss supplements.
15613.04 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
15615.14 many people derive tremendous
benefit from them for things
15617.66 like enhancing the depth
and quality of sleep,
15619.97 for enhancing focus and
for hormone support,
15622.52 and many other aspects of
mental health, physical health,
15624.95 and performance.
15625.94 The Huberman Lab podcast
is proud to announce
15627.86 that we are now partnered
