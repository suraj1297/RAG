0.38 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast
2.37 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.94 for everyday life.
9.57 - I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology
12.36 and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.
15.88 This podcast is separate
17.03 from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.
19.48 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
21.66 to bring you zero cost
to consumer information
23.78 about science and science related tools
25.89 to the general public.
27.57 And keeping with that theme,
28.71 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
31.78 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
34.52 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
37.14 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
39.64 to help you better understand your body
41.34 and help you reach your health goals.
43.81 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood tests
46.98 and the simple reason for that
48.71 is that so many of the factors
50.28 that impact our immediate and
longterm health and wellbeing
53.98 can only be analyzed from blood.
56.23 And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,
58.58 you can get additional
layers of information
60.82 that can really support your understanding
62.5 about what's going on deep
under the hood, so to speak
66.5 inside your body and brain
and what to do about it.
70.337 And I think that's really
where InsideTracker
72.29 sets itself apart from
other similar tests.
75.68 What InsideTracker
offers is, first of all,
78.34 they make the tests very easy.
79.9 They can come to your home to
take your blood and DNA test
82.24 or you can go to a
testing center nearby you.
85.31 Then you get the information back
86.88 and rather than just getting information
88.67 about whether or not the
levels of various things
90.56 are high or low,
92.27 you also get to find
out what to do about it.
95.23 So it offers directives
related to nutrition,
97.88 to exercise and so forth.
100.21 It's really allow you to be in control
102.9 of your overall health,
both where you are now
105.32 and its long-term trajectory.
107.85 With InsideTracker, they
also have something which is
111.49 it can give you a readout
of your inner age.
113.64 They have something
called the inner age test
115.24 that really compares your biological age
117.5 to your chronological age,
118.66 something that's of extreme
importance and interest
120.88 because it has to do with
lifespan or predicted lifespan.
124.34 If you'd like to try InsideTracker
125.85 you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

142.55 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.
145.62 Helix Sleep is a company that
makes mattresses and pillows
148.31 ideally suited to your sleep needs.
150.8 I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress
152.47 for the last six months,
and I can honestly say
154.94 it's the best sleep that I've ever gotten.
157.41 Helix Sleep has a quiz that can match you
159.49 to the ideal mattress and pillows for you.
162.87 It's a quiz that takes
just about two minutes,
165.14 asks you questions like do
you tend to sleep on your side
167.62 or your back on your stomach?
169.62 Or maybe you don't know,
170.62 whether or not you tend to wake up
171.76 feeling too warm or too cold?
173.66 Various questions about your sleep habits.
176.45 At the end of that quiz,
177.29 it matches you to a specific mattress
179.37 that's perfect for your sleep needs.
181.2 For me, it matched me to the dusk, D-U-S-K
184.27 because I wanted a mattress
185.28 that wasn't too firm nor too soft
187.96 and I really love the mattress.
189.24 As I mentioned, I've been
sleeping terrifically well
191.37 ever since I got that mattress.
193.33 If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress
195.02 you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
197.61 take their two minutes sleep quiz
199.15 and they'll match you
to a customized mattress
201.01 and then you'll get up to
$200 off all mattresses
204.22 and you'll get two free pillows.
206.61 They have a 10 year warranty.
207.95 You get to try it out for a
hundred nights, risk-free,
210.39 if you don't like it, they'll
even pick it up for free,
212.47 take it away but I really think you will,
214.84 I certainly love mine.
216.16 Again, if you're interested,
217.1 you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
for up to $200 off
220.82 and two free pillows.
222.67 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Theragun.
226.1 Theragun is a handheld
percussive therapy device
228.24 that releases deep muscle tension.
230.7 I first learned about
Theragun on a lab expedition.
233.88 We're actually headed out to ocean
235.83 where we were doing diving
with great white sharks,
238.34 filming those for our VR fear
experiments in the laboratory
242.29 and it was very long days
of carrying Pelican cases,
245.76 those are cases these hard
plastic cases with equipment,
249.12 it was diving, we were all
sore and tired all the time.
253.0 And someone had brought along a Theragun.
254.817 It was the first time I had seen one
256.67 and pretty soon that thing
was getting passed along
258.51 and became one of the more
coveted devices on board.
261.15 Everyone wanted time with this
thing because it was great,
263.06 you could give yourself
a really terrific massage
266.06 and get deep into the
tissue and relieve soreness.
268.81 When I got back, I got a Theragun
270.47 and so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.
273.77 Whether or not you want
to treat your muscles
276.0 because they're tense from working out
277.51 or whether or not you just
want to release stress,
279.1 it's a terrific tool.
280.84 Many of you are familiar probably
with professional massages
284.07 but Theragun is
interesting because you can
286.17 basically give yourself
a deep tissue massage,
288.37 anytime, anywhere, it's also very quiet.
291.28 If you want to try Theragun,
you can try it for 30 days.
294.06 They start at only $199.
296.25 You can go to
theragun.com/huberman right now
299.68 and you can get your gen
fourth Theragun today,
301.68 that's the one that I use or
another one of their models.
303.93 That's Theragun.com/huberman
to try Theragun.
308.63 This episode marks the
beginning of a new topic
311.5 for the Huberman Lab Podcast.
313.85 As many of you already know,
315.83 we go deep into a
particular topic over four,
318.4 sometimes even five episodes.
320.41 We just closed out the
episodes on hormones.
323.32 Now we are going to talk
324.52 about how to optimize physical performance
327.16 and skill learning.
328.72 We're going to look deep
at the science behind this
331.08 as well as specific practices.
333.57 In fact, today, you're going
to hear about specific tools
336.45 that you can use to improve
endurance and strength by up to,
341.17 I'm not making this up,
342.22 three or four times your current capacity.
345.25 This is based on studies
that were done at Stanford
347.75 and are currently in use
349.18 by collegiate and professional teams.
352.64 If you're not a professional
athlete or a serious athlete,
355.47 that's okay.
356.303 The topics, this month
357.37 and all the information
we are going to cover
359.3 are going to make you
360.133 a better recreational exerciser as well.
363.7 If you're not an exerciser
364.95 and you're thinking
about getting into that
366.38 or if you live in the Northern hemisphere
368.1 and you're just thinking
about the beach this summer
370.51 or fat loss, muscle
building, that sort of thing,
373.67 this month we're going to
cover all of that as well.
376.4 There's so much confusion out there
378.13 about how to optimize fat
loss, muscle building,
381.23 improvements in flexibility, for instance,
383.32 or skill learning.
384.43 I know many of you, aren't so focused
386.11 on the cosmetic aspects
of physical exercise
389.23 but are interested in
actual skill learning,
391.41 we're going to talk about that too.
394.06 I want to just take a moment
395.74 to reflect on something
that came up last episode.
398.59 If you didn't see that episode,
that's quite all right.
401.35 But last episode, we were talking
402.81 about the hormones,
adrenaline, and cortisol
405.15 and how to leverage those
towards attention and learning
408.8 and there was a little bit of confusion
410.42 that I want to clarify.
411.84 I mentioned an optimal
protocol for learning
414.38 that involves leveraging
adrenaline also called epinephrin
418.06 and it involved four steps.
420.35 The four steps that I spelled out
422.38 were to be calm and focused
424.99 while one is trying to acquire
or learn the new skill,
428.7 cognitive skill or motor skill,
430.52 then to have a spike in adrenaline.
433.52 I mentioned ways to do that,
435.06 using cold or breathing or other tools,
438.06 immediately after the learning episode
440.73 then to incorporate what I
call non sleep deep rest,
444.05 a 20 minute episode of a shallow
nap or some other protocol
449.55 like NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol
452.19 of which we always provide
links in the captions.
455.12 And then to try and optimize
sleep later that night
458.35 and the subsequent night.
459.83 Some of you heard this
and it sunk in right away
463.44 and it was straight forward.
464.65 Others said, wait, I thought
from a previous episode
467.33 even before that, you said you're supposed
468.82 to do non sleep deep rest
immediately after learning, no.
472.06 We added another step,
the logic still follows
475.93 that you want to be calm
and focused during learning,
479.09 then you want to spike
adrenaline at the end.
481.0 Most people get that backward,
482.37 they're drinking too much coffee
483.64 or even taking nootropics and things,
485.26 trying to be really
focused while learning.
487.18 Some people are taking
Adderall recreationally
489.7 something I don't recommend,
491.08 that's actually getting
the whole process backwards
493.2 if you look at the data in the physiology.
495.07 You want to spike adrenaline at the end
497.36 or immediately after a learning episode
500.09 and then non sleep deep rest
and then sleep itself, okay?
504.75 Four steps, hope that
clarifies things for you,
507.01 if you have any additional questions
508.39 please put them in the
comment section below.
511.32 Okay, so let's talk about
physical performance.
514.93 There are so many variables
to physical performance
517.95 and we can manage physical
performance and skill learning
521.72 from a variety of contexts.
523.86 I made just a short list
of some of the things
525.64 that come to mind that
can powerfully impact
527.95 physical performance and skill learning.
530.29 Some of them are what I
would consider foundational.
533.21 They allow you to show
up your current ability
536.72 and if you were to disrupt those,
538.74 you would perform less well.
540.58 So things like getting
a good night's sleep,
543.39 things like being properly hydrated,
546.0 things like being well nourished,
548.11 whatever that means to you.
549.21 I know some of you like
to exercise fasted,
551.16 some of you prefer to
have food in your stomach
554.68 or have eaten a couple hours before.
557.61 There are supplements, there are drugs,
559.26 there are different ways to breathe,
560.77 there are so many tools related
to mindset, visualization,
564.34 there are machines and devices,
it's just a vast space,
568.46 but it's not infinite.
570.36 And there are a few things
in the list of things
573.92 that can impact and even
optimize physical performance
577.48 and skill learning that
have an outsized effect
581.08 that any of you can use.
582.44 Many of them, most of them
are low to zero costs.
585.89 So today we are going to
focus on what I believe to be
589.77 one of the most powerful tools
592.49 to improve physical performance
594.73 and skill learning and recovery
597.54 and we'll talk about why that's important
600.43 and that's temperature.
602.58 Now many of you might think,
oh, well that's kind of boring,
604.81 I want to know about the
magic pill that I can take
607.42 that's going to allow
me to dunk a basketball
609.1 if I currently can't or I
want to know about the thing
611.12 that's going to let me
run further and faster
612.82 is going to shed fat.
614.25 Believe it or not, temperature
is the most powerful variable
618.9 for improving physical
performance and for recovery.
623.21 I would argue it's even
more important than sleep
625.88 because temperature itself
is going to dictate how well
629.61 and when you sleep and the
depth of your total recovery.
633.55 There are two aspects to
temperature of course,
636.19 there's heat and there's cold.
638.83 We are mainly going to focus on cold
641.67 as a way to buffer heat.
644.02 In a previous podcast episode,
646.0 I talked all about growth hormone.
647.82 You can find that episode about
fibroid and growth hormone
650.22 and how heat can be a powerful stimulus
652.53 for increasing growth hormone
654.55 which is involved in
tissue repair and et cetera
656.99 and burn fat and improve
metabolism in various ways.
660.74 However, cold I would argue
663.72 is even more powerful than heat as a tool
666.57 and I'm not just talking
about putting ice packs
668.63 on sore muscles or slightly
sprained limbs and ankles
673.4 and things of that sort.
674.82 We're going to talk about cold
676.23 from the standpoint of thermal physiology.
679.87 This is a literature that's
rich in scientific information
683.71 that goes back very deep
into the last century
687.72 where physiologists and
neuroscientists figured out
690.58 that there are different
compartments in your body
693.36 that heat and cool you differently
695.49 and that you can leverage
those in order to double
698.63 and as I mentioned before
699.463 even triple or quadruple your work output
701.76 both strength, repetitions, and endurance.
704.87 So this is not weak sauces that they say,
707.42 this is the stuff that can
708.82 really shift the needle quite a bit
711.72 and it's not just about well once,
714.7 it's about being able to
perform well and recover
717.09 from that performance so
that you do even better
719.52 when you're not incorporating these tools
722.11 on days where for instance,
you can't access cold
725.67 or an ice pack or an ice bath
or things of that sort, okay?
729.29 So we're going to cover cold,
we're going to talk a little bit
731.53 about the physiology of cold
and heat and how they work
735.34 because as you've probably
heard me say before
739.17 if you can understand some mechanism,
741.26 if you can just push yourself
742.34 through a little bit of new knowledge,
743.78 into understanding a
little bit of mechanism
746.52 about how you work, you'll
be in a far better position
750.1 to implement the tools in the
best and most flexible ways
753.51 for your needs.
754.81 This is why at the Huberman Lab Podcast,
757.25 I never ever do a just list of the things
760.33 that you should do.
761.35 I don't believe in that,
just tell me what to do.
763.63 First, I tell you why
you should do something.
765.88 What's the logical framework
that it's grounded in
768.24 and then we distill that
down to specific protocols.
771.68 For those of you that are
too impatient for that,
773.36 there are millions, if not billions
775.49 of other resources out
there that will take you
777.26 into the cul-de-sac of one
protocol that will work
780.67 and then stop working or might
work for you indefinitely,
783.3 that's not how we work here.
784.97 This is about really
understanding the mechanism
787.62 so that you can tweak
things and modify things,
790.32 adjust the timing and the dosage of things
792.45 and really get the most out
of these tools and protocols.
796.15 Everything I'm going to talk about
798.45 pertains to both endurance exercise
801.05 and strength and speed type exercise.
804.6 So sprints, weightlifting, endurance work
807.6 and to some extent, flexibility
809.14 but we're going to cover
flexibility in depth
812.09 as well as another feature
that's not often talked about
814.4 which is suppleness or
smoothness of movement
817.32 over different ranges of
movement in a subsequent episode.
821.99 Let's start by talking about temperature.
824.01 What is temperature?
825.74 How does temperature impact the body
828.38 and its ability to perform,
including learn new skills?
832.37 So everyone probably remembers,
834.59 or has at least heard of
the word homeostasis, right?
838.3 That the body wants to remain
840.13 in a particular range of temperatures,
842.77 that it doesn't like to
be too hot or too cold.
845.69 And I want to emphasize from the outset
848.27 that there are many mechanisms
that are installed into us
852.13 by way of our evolutionary
design and our genome
855.83 meaning we were just born
with this stuff ready
858.68 to keep our body temperature
in a particular narrow range.
862.71 Heating up too much is just plain bad.
866.42 It's not just bad for
physical performance,
868.28 it's bad for all tissue health.
871.68 If your brain heats up too
much, neurons start dying
875.01 and those neurons don't come back, okay?
877.83 You may have heard about neurogenesis,
879.49 the ability for the brain
to regenerate itself
882.08 or generate new neurons and adulthood,
883.67 there's very little neurogenesis
excuse me, in adulthood,
888.42 even after anytime after puberty really
890.91 and you don't want to lose neurons
893.62 in the central nervous system.
894.92 If you get too hot, that'll happen.
896.7 It's called hyperthermia, you
want to avoid hyperthermia
899.7 and you have many mechanisms
901.3 that are built into you to
avoid becoming hyperthermic.
905.85 The other thing that
happens when we get too warm
908.61 is that we have in all of our cells,
911.81 what are called enzymes.
913.746 You generally know if
something's an enzyme
916.62 because it ends in the
letters, A-S-E, right?
919.97 So lipase is an enzyme
that exists to digest fats.
925.21 You have proteases that are
there to digest proteins, right?
929.95 So anytime you see A-S-E
chances are it's an enzyme.
935.16 Enzymes are proteins, and they
have a particular structure
941.14 and their structure becomes
modified when heat increases
946.32 and that's not good.
947.47 You want their structure
to be of a particular type.
950.37 Imagine a car with four wheels,
952.61 let's just say the car is the enzyme.
955.06 If it gets too hot, it's like
two of the wheels fall off
958.51 and that thing can't function.
959.88 So one of the reasons
why the body and nature
963.01 goes through so much effort
to build in mechanisms
965.83 to make sure that we don't become too warm
967.99 is because when we get to warm,
970.04 these enzymes don't function,
cells stop functioning,
973.5 they stop being able to generate energy,
975.76 they stop being able to digest things,
978.43 you stop being able to think
980.32 and eventually those cells
start dying off entirely.
984.52 So keeping temperature in a
particular range is really good,
987.64 you don't want to get too hot.
989.49 We have much more flexibility
in terms of getting cold.
992.82 Now you don't want to
become hypothermic either.
995.1 You can die from hypothermia
996.5 just like you can die from hyperthermia.
999.17 However that you have a
lot more range to be cold
1004.31 than you do to be too warm, okay?
1006.98 And in general, the idea is
to keep the body and brain
1010.67 in a particular range but
anytime we do anything,
1014.8 our body temperature can shift.
1016.88 So for instance, if you were
to stand next to a campfire
1021.02 or you were outside on a hot day,
1023.1 various things would happen
to dump heat from your body.
1026.99 If you were outside on a cold day
1028.62 or you were to get into a
cold shower or a cold lake,
1031.76 various things would happen
1032.86 to insulate heat within your body.
1034.44 This is all pretty straightforward
and obvious I realize.
1037.07 Now, what are those things?
1038.67 Well, there are a huge category of them.
1041.22 When you get into cold water,
you secrete adrenaline.
1044.03 On a hot day, if it's really
hot or in a very hot sauna
1047.25 or in the hot desert,
1048.083 you will generate what are
called heat shock proteins
1050.48 which will set off other sets of cascades,
1053.56 metabolic cascades, biological cascades.
1057.6 But the simplest way to think
about this process is that
1061.06 when we get cold, we
tend to vasoconstrict.
1065.36 Our blood vessels tend to constrict
1067.68 and we tend to push energy
toward the core of our body
1071.15 to preserve our core organs, okay?
1073.34 So our periphery, our hands
and our feet and our toes
1076.17 and our legs become colder
1077.95 and our core therefore can
maintain blood to that area
1081.66 and we are insulating our core.
1084.46 Conversely, when we heat up
our blood vessels vasodilate,
1088.91 they expand a bit and more
blood flows to our periphery
1093.06 and more blood can move
throughout the body generally
1096.26 and we will perspire, we will
sweat, water will actually
1100.58 get pulled out of the
blood to some extent,
1103.15 moved up through sweat glands
1104.66 and will be brought to the skin surface
1107.22 so that it can be dumped,
we are dumping heat.
1110.84 Animals, as you know vary
in their capacity to sweat.
1114.65 Some animals like camels
won't start sweating at first
1118.37 if they heat up, what
they'll do is they'll spit,
1120.56 they'll dump heat by spitting, okay?
1123.26 Dogs pant, Castilla is
off to my left here,
1126.35 he pants when he gets
too warm, he can't sweat
1129.88 or dogs can maybe sweat a little bit.
1132.72 But we can sweat and
you've probably noticed
1136.7 that on a humid hot day,
you'll feel much warmer
1141.35 just walking or running than you would
1143.83 with the equivalent exercise or movement
1146.61 than you would on a cold day.
1148.11 And some of you probably
know this, but if you don't
1150.4 the reason is you sweat on a cold day,
1153.34 but because the air is dry typically,
1156.7 you will bring that sweat to the surface
1159.81 and provided you're wearing clothes
1161.81 that allow some air to get
out away from the body,
1166.75 so you're not wearing,
you know, really tight,
1168.17 you know spandex type clothing
or something like that,
1170.253 or, you know seal type
saran wrap type clothing
1173.7 that sweat will evaporate
off into the dry atmosphere.
1177.47 Whereas on a humid day,
the reason you see people
1180.18 in New York and Florida
on a humid summer day
1182.69 and they're like moving
their shirts off themselves
1184.41 and you see people with, you know
1185.28 big sweat stains and back sweat stains
1187.34 and all this kind of stuff
is because they're sweating
1191.02 as they normally would, but it's humid
1193.34 and so there is the humidity,
the air doesn't allow transfer
1197.32 of that sweat into the
atmosphere as readily
1200.37 and so you're hot, okay?
1202.68 So without the evaporation,
you're going to be warmer.
1206.52 So we evaporate off sweat, we sweat
1209.44 and we vasodilate when
we want to dump heat.
1211.74 When we want to maintain
heat, we vasoconstrict
1214.7 and we tend to not sweat.
1216.64 The other thing that happens
is you'll get goosebumps.
1219.51 So-called goose pimples
they're sometimes called.
1221.99 Those are a throwback to the time
1224.33 where we had fur over
most, not all of our body.
1227.8 All mammals in the cold have a process
1231.84 whereby adrenaline is
released at low levels
1234.93 typically into the body,
that adrenaline activates
1239.16 what are called sympathetic fibers,
1240.65 they have nothing to do with sympathy,
1242.33 those little fibers, which are neurons,
1244.43 those fibers that what I'm
saying are fibers are neurons,
1246.86 not clothing fibers,
reach up into the skin
1249.47 so your whole body is covered
with these little tiny neurons
1251.98 that reach up into the
skin and when we are cold,
1254.83 they actually mechanically
take the hair follicle
1257.9 and bend it up, it's a
process called pilo erection,
1262.63 P-I-L-O erection, okay?
1265.36 So on a hot day, you
want to dump heat, okay?
1269.56 So on a hot day, what would happen is
1271.96 you'd actually not see those goose pimples
1274.48 because you want the hairs lying down
1276.51 which actually you would think
that might insulate you more
1278.86 but we'll actually let
more heat dissipate out
1281.05 through the skin.
1282.38 On a cold day, you get these
goose pimples or goosebumps
1285.66 which are really just
an ancient carry over
1287.89 from the body's attempt to
make hair stand up on end.
1292.06 And when hair step stand up on end
1294.23 and they're very close together
1295.17 that traps air in between
them and actually creates
1297.81 a sort of insulated blanket of warm air.
1300.57 If you've ever seen an animal
like a a Malamute or a Husky,
1305.85 you might think, oh that
poor thing on a hot day,
1308.32 what does it do?
1309.3 You know, with all that hair?
1310.14 Well, it can be warm so the
animal will typically pant
1312.96 and its hair will lay down,
which you might think would act
1316.02 as more of a blanket, but on a cold day
1318.36 what'll happen is they'll
become very puffy.
1321.44 Their hair will stand up on end
1323.33 and that's actually trapping
heat between the hairs
1325.66 and they're actually quite well insulated.
1327.68 So it's very important that
if you want to understand
1331.3 how you can leverage temperature
for physical performance,
1335.55 you have to understand
1336.86 that you have vasoconstriction
to conserve heat,
1338.91 vasodilation to dump heat,
1340.58 that you are sweating to dump heat,
1342.21 and you have conservation of fluids
1344.7 in order to preserve heat.
1347.9 That's the most important thing
1349.52 in terms of understanding the mechanisms
1351.5 of maintaining and dumping heat.
1353.4 And now the most important
thing to understand is that
1356.48 if you get too hot, not only
do those enzymes stop working
1360.53 but your ability to contract
your muscles stops, okay?
1365.24 I'm going to repeat this
because it's vitally important.
1369.24 ATP is involved in the process
1372.6 of generating muscle contractions,
1374.33 it doesn't matter if
you're running a marathon,
1375.96 doesn't matter if you're
doing a yoga class,
1377.52 doesn't matter if you're
going for a 700 pound squat,
1381.23 the range of temperatures
within which ATP can function
1384.97 and muscles can contract is very narrow.
1387.92 Somewhere around 39 or 40
degrees Celsius, it drops off
1392.54 and you will not be able to
generate more contractions.
1396.3 Now that's pretty hot,
but that temperature
1398.68 can be generated locally really fast.
1401.1 Now, if you're too cold,
1402.5 it's true it's hard to
generate muscle contractions.
1404.65 I got into doing some cold water
swimming a little while ago
1408.45 and we would joke that, you
know, you come out of the water,
1410.5 we do no wetsuits,
1412.22 I'm not recommending
people do this necessarily
1414.07 unless you're with certainly
1415.02 with somebody else who's skilled
at doing it, which I was.
1417.15 And you come out
1418.23 and you feel like you
have claws for hands.
1420.29 You can, you know, you
could never text on a phone
1422.33 for the first few minutes,
1423.25 I mean, the water was very, very cold
1425.22 and you can't even move your face
1426.69 and so muscles will become rigid
1428.84 but heating up muscles causes
them to fail to be able
1433.22 to generate more contractions.
1435.38 Put simply if you get too
hot, you stop exercising.
1439.41 You may not even realize it
1440.76 but your will to exercise further,
1443.4 your ability to push harder
1445.93 is entirely dependent on
the heat of the muscle
1448.9 both locally and your whole system.
1451.78 So let's talk about your whole system
1454.33 because I just described heat
dumping and heat maintaining.
1458.13 I told you that increasing heat
1460.73 makes it hard for muscles to contract.
1462.77 It will stop you from being
able to run further and faster,
1466.63 it will stop you from being
able to lift more weights,
1469.49 more sets, more repetitions.
1471.53 If you can keep temperature
in range however,
1474.81 in a proper range, you will
be able to do more work,
1478.84 you will be able to create greater output,
1481.6 you'll be able to lift more
weight, more sets, more reps
1485.17 and you'll be able to run further.
1487.59 Now, there are data that I'm going to talk
1489.441 about in a little bit that
are absolutely striking
1491.91 that underscore that statement.
1493.21 There are data from my
colleague Craig Heller's lab
1495.26 in the department of biology at Stanford
1497.28 and there are data that
are now being implemented.
1499.87 They were first implemented
in a grant funded by DARPA
1503.17 but now in professional sports teams.
1505.14 Many, if not all the NFL teams
are now using this technology
1509.06 as well as military uses it
1510.74 and not just for sports
performance, but also firefighters,
1514.22 construction workers, other professions
1517.0 where elevated heat becomes
a barrier to performance
1520.67 and you can leverage this to
really improve your workouts.
1523.91 And when I say really
improve, it is striking.
1526.06 I'm going to give away a
little hint of this now
1527.63 and then I'm going to
tell you a little bit more
1528.79 of the data later after
I tell you the protocols.
1532.24 Proper cooling of the body,
1535.69 which has to be done
in a very specific way,
1538.55 has allowed recreational athletes,
1541.09 college students and typical adults
1543.09 as well as professional athletes
1545.13 to go from doing their usual output.
1548.3 In this case what comes to mind best
1550.39 would be a particular
professional athletes
1552.64 that a member of the 49ers at the time
1555.12 was able to do 40 dips on
his first set, 30, 20, 20,
1558.64 basically to 10 sets of dips
unassisted with anything else.
1561.86 That's an impressive
1564.17 especially since he's a really large guy,
1566.92 40 dips is as a respectable,
1568.45 these are strict, full, full range dips.
1571.86 And then by the 10th set,
there's a steep drop-off.
1574.16 Using proper cooling of
particular body compartments,
1578.78 he was able to triple that
within less than a week
1583.3 and maintain that performance
1585.38 even without the cooling approach.
1586.83 So it was actually a
conditioning effect, all right?
1589.9 I'll get back to this in a little bit
1591.44 but there are other
fantastic leaps of effort
1595.41 and leaps of performance
that were demonstrated
1598.83 including endurance running.
1602.11 Before I continue any, I
just want to underscore again
1605.12 that overheating is terrible.
1607.04 There's a famous example of this.
1610.5 This was about 10, 15 years ago
1612.5 when a number of dietary supplements
1614.65 that included things like
epinephrin which is a stimulant,
1617.78 it's a beta adrenergic stimulant,
drugs like Clenbuterol,
1622.39 which were then banned from the Olympics,
1624.38 which are still out there
have been in recreational use
1626.42 which were beta adrenergic
agonist so these are drugs
1629.91 that sort of mimic epinephrin
adrenaline to some extent,
1633.82 I know I'm oversimplifying this here.
1635.4 They improve flat loss because
of the effects on metabolism
1638.61 but they heat up the body.
1640.22 And what happened was, this
hit the press very widely
1642.72 is high school football players
1644.61 and various professional
athletes were dropping dead
1646.88 because they were overheating
1647.84 during practice or in competition.
1649.87 So much so that Clenbuterol was banned.
1652.76 Although every once in a while,
1653.7 somebody gets in trouble for using this,
1656.71 there was an incidence of this recently
1658.05 in professional boxing which
was attributed to a bad meat
1661.21 that had contained the Clenbuterol.
1662.89 I don't know what the source was,
1666.05 I don't have any commentary about that,
1667.62 but it still is in use,
1668.88 but these drugs increased
body temperature,
1671.79 increased fat loss, but
carry is severe danger
1675.97 and that's the danger of hyperthermia.
1678.6 In fact, I would argue and I
think in talking to some folks
1681.79 at in various professional
fighting organizations
1683.97 it's very clear that a lot
of the deaths that one sees
1686.42 in professional combat
sports may have to do
1690.25 as much with dehydration and overheating
1693.09 as it does with getting hit in
the head, which is also bad,
1696.5 but that things can compound
1697.84 that can have a synergistic effect.
1699.97 And just a note about
that and hyperthermia
1702.68 and it's dangerous as well.
1704.53 My first project ever in science
1706.31 was to evaluate the thermogenic
effects of MDMA or ecstasy.
1710.32 That was my senior thesis
in college actually.
1713.66 And what we found was that indeed drugs
1717.67 that remove your understanding
of how warm you are
1721.95 cause you to not take on
the appropriate behaviors
1725.6 to cool yourself, right?
1727.28 So your vasoconstriction
and you're sweating,
1730.72 those are autonomic,
1731.86 those are going to happen no matter what
1733.34 unless you happen to take
something that blocks that effect.
1736.47 However, there are a lot of things
1737.7 that we as humans do to prevent
ourselves from overheating
1741.1 and the main one is stop.
1744.12 When we are running in the desert
1746.01 or when we're running very
hard and suddenly we stop,
1749.22 oftentimes that's because
the muscles are overheating,
1752.07 it's a subconscious thing.
1753.49 We won't often think, oh,
I'm really much too warm,
1755.95 it's just that we stop
1757.65 and it's a self-preservation mechanisms.
1759.8 Sometimes it kicks into early,
sometimes it kicks into late.
1763.36 Kicks in too late, you can die.
1765.44 There's an instance in the 1984 Olympics
1767.42 where there was the first year I believe
1770.14 that there was a women's marathon,
1772.4 I think that's correct.
1773.61 And one of the front runners
or top picks for winning
1777.03 was heading into the stadium
1778.49 and all of a sudden, it
seemed as if she was lost,
1781.27 she was kind of wandering around
1782.66 not knowing where she should go
1784.15 and in fact, she was in a position to win
1786.19 or at least take second
place, at least take silver,
1788.77 got totally disoriented and
did miserably in the race
1792.06 and she was hyperthermic,
1793.74 she was running against
that reflex to stop.
1796.71 So dumping heat is key.
1798.64 So how do you dump heat in
order to perform longer safely?
1804.63 Well, in order to understand
that you have to understand
1807.19 that the body has three main compartments
1809.7 for regulating temperature, okay?
1811.62 We don't just have a
center and a periphery,
1813.72 we have three main compartments
1815.41 and there's one compartment in particular
1817.64 that all of you or most all
of you, I have to assume have
1822.45 and if you can understand how that works,
1825.4 you can do tremendous
things for your performance
1827.91 and for your recovery.
1829.66 So what I'm about to tell you
1830.9 will allow you to perform
better in all forms of exercise
1834.77 and it is not commonly known,
1836.81 unfortunately, I'm here
to try and change that.
1839.78 You have three compartments
1841.11 for increasing or dumping
heat in your body.
1844.99 One is your core, we
already talked about that.
1848.19 Your core organs, your heart,
1849.39 your lungs, your pancreas, your liver,
1851.97 this is the core of your body.
1854.05 The other is your periphery,
which are obviously your arms
1858.12 and your legs and your
feet and your hands.
1860.31 But then there's a third component
1862.82 which has their three
locations on your body
1866.12 that are far better at
passing heat out of the body
1869.93 and bringing cool into the body
1872.8 such that you can heat up
1874.95 or cool your body everywhere very quickly.
1879.3 Those three areas are your
face, the palms of your hands
1884.44 and the bottoms of your feet.
1886.72 Now, the skin on your hands
and on the bottoms of your feet
1889.81 and to some extent on your
face are called glaborous skin.
1893.33 That's G-L-A-B-O-R-O-U-S glaborous skin.
1899.07 And what's special about
those areas of your body
1902.35 and the glaborous skin
is that the arrangement
1906.55 of vasculature, of blood
vessels, capillaries and arteries
1910.74 that serve those regions is very different
1913.41 than it is elsewhere in your body.
1915.89 Now, this has ancient roots.
1919.38 Typically, if you were
another mammal, like a bear
1922.72 or some sort of ape, you would
have hair all over your body.
1926.97 Now we all know some pretty hairy people.
1928.85 I presume you've heard that
there are these hairy people,
1931.1 I know a few excessively hairy people
1934.29 and Castilla is excessively hairy
1935.75 but he's not a person obviously
1937.93 but all mammals have hair
on their bodies, too.
1941.93 Some people have very light
hair or very fine hair.
1946.83 We don't have hair on these
glaborous skin regions.
1949.91 Now, of course you can have
beard or facial hair growth
1953.08 but there are still
regions like the cheeks
1955.16 and other areas that maintain
this special vasculature.
1958.51 Okay, so technically the hands and feet
1960.23 are real glaborous skin
1961.9 and the face is not always
quite classified as glaborous
1965.86 but these three locations
face, palms of hands
1969.09 not tops and bottoms of feet
are very good at dumping heat
1974.4 and bringing in cool.
1976.28 And the reason is there's
a rule in vascular biology
1981.34 that blood moves from
arteries to capillaries
1984.9 and then to veins, and then
back to the heart, okay?
1988.01 So arteries which are
the big ones obviously,
1991.03 capillaries which are the little fine ones
1993.15 where oxygen and carbon
dioxide are exchanged
1996.44 and veins which then bring
blood back to the heart
2000.94 and other tissues of course.
2004.18 In these three regions
of your hands, your face
2007.96 and the bottoms of your feet,
2009.79 we have what are called AVAs.
2012.08 AVAs are a very special
pattern of vasculature.
2016.45 AVAs are described in
the medical textbooks.
2018.94 You can find them in Grey's anatomy
2020.41 not the television show
2021.77 but the actual Grey's anatomy textbook
2024.28 which is a real thing that exists
2026.19 and in all medical textbooks, okay?
2029.66 So let's talk about AVAs and what they are
2032.45 and why they allow these
three regions of the body
2035.02 to heat or cool ourselves more readily.
2039.5 So what are AVAs?
2041.77 AVAs are arterio-venous anastomosis.
2045.6 So if you want to look that up
2047.18 you can just look up
AVAs veins, capillaries,
2050.62 arteries if you like, but
I'll spell it for you.
2054.87 A-R-T-E-R-I-O, arterio
venous, V-E-N-O-U-S,
2062.54 arterio-venous anastomosis,
A-N-A-S-T-O-M-O-S-E-S.
2070.13 Arterio-venous anastomosis, okay?
2072.57 You want to know about
Arterio-venous anastomosis, trust me
2076.69 and you want to remember
that they are in your hands,
2079.16 the bottoms of your feet and on your face,
2081.38 and in particular on
the palms of your hands,
2083.37 not the tops of your hands.
2084.77 Now, before I said blood flows typically
2087.81 from arteries to capillaries, to veins,
2089.85 and then back to the heart.
2091.43 But AVAs are direct connections
2093.65 between the small arteries
and the small veins.
2096.66 They bypass the
capillaries to some extent.
2100.08 They are little short vessel segments,
2102.4 they have a big, large inner diameter
2105.14 and they have this very
thick, muscular wall.
2108.29 And they get input from what
are called adrenergic neurons.
2112.25 They get input from neurons
2113.86 that release norepinephrine
and epinephrine,
2117.36 which allows them to contract or dilate.
2120.06 Now there's some rules of physics
2121.46 that talk about how the radius of a pipe
2124.53 and small changes in the radius of a pipe
2127.36 leads to massive increases in
the rate and amount of stuff
2132.79 that can flow through that pipe, okay?
2134.823 There's a rule of physics
that says essentially
2137.26 that the radius is proportional
to the amount of stuff
2141.89 that can flow through
something to the fourth power.
2144.47 We're not going to make
this a physics class,
2145.97 but if you want to look that up, you can,
2148.02 you can just look up how
does the radius of a tube
2150.47 or pipe relate to how quickly
2152.16 or how much stuff can flow through it?
2154.89 What you need to know,
2156.38 even if you don't want to know
any of the underlying physics
2158.25 is that these AVAs allow more heat
2161.15 to leave the body more quickly
2163.97 and more cool to enter
the body more quickly
2167.39 than other venous arterial capillary beds
2172.94 throughout the body.
2173.773 In other words, you can heat
up best at the face, the palms
2177.63 and the bottoms of the feet,
and you can cool down best
2180.82 at the face, the palms and
the bottoms of the feet
2183.65 than you can anywhere else on your body.
2185.71 And when I say heat up or cool down,
2187.17 I mean actually heat or cool
the core end your brain.
2191.25 Okay, so this is vitally important.
2193.21 I realize we're getting down
2194.22 into the mechanistic weeds
here, but you need to know
2197.07 that these three
compartments of your body,
2199.53 palms, bottoms of feet and face
2201.74 are your best leverage points
for manipulating temperature
2206.15 to vastly improve physical
performance, okay?
2210.34 I also want to point out
2212.11 that the work that I'm
going to tell you about
2214.3 is not work from my laboratory.
2215.97 It's the work of, as I mentioned,
2217.47 my colleague Craig Heller's
laboratory at Stanford
2220.22 and we're going to have
Craig on as a guest
2222.4 to talk more about these discoveries,
2224.69 they are his and his
colleagues discoveries
2228.45 and how you can leverage them.
2229.74 They're building out
some amazing technology.
2232.193 I had a conversation with Craig yesterday
2234.53 as a prelude to this episode
2237.13 and to the future conversation with him
2239.28 so you're getting the
very latest on this topic.
2242.76 So what Craig and his colleagues did
2244.7 really illustrates perfectly
2246.45 what these body surfaces can do and why.
2250.73 They were studying overheating
in athletes and in military
2256.44 and in construction workers
and trying to prevent it.
2260.02 And they did a bunch of experiments,
2261.7 I won't go into all of them now
2263.35 but what they essentially found
was that cooling the palms,
2267.19 palmer cooling allowed people, athletes,
2271.96 and recreational athletes
to run much further,
2276.03 to lift more weight and
to do more sets and reps
2279.73 to a absolutely staggering degree.
2284.73 Let's talk for a second, a
bit more about why we stop,
2289.21 why we shut off effort when we get too hot
2293.66 because in doing so,
you'll really understand
2296.31 how and why the best protocols exist
2298.96 for being able to do more work,
2301.06 to be able to exercise longer
2303.8 and actually to feel good doing it.
2305.44 You actually can make
a doubling of your dips
2308.11 or believe it or not a
tripling or quadrupling or more
2310.92 of your pull-ups fairly straightforward.
2314.78 I mentioned before that
when muscle heats up,
2319.25 enzymes start getting disrupted
2321.93 and ATP and muscles can't work so well
2324.88 and those muscles can't contract.
2326.68 Let's get a little more
specific about that.
2328.47 The enzyme that's involved here
2330.51 is something called pyruvate kinase.
2332.71 You don't need to know
about pyruvate kinase
2334.39 but what you do need to
know is that it ends A-S-E
2336.7 which means it's an
enzyme and pyruvate kinase
2341.41 is essentially a rate limiting step.
2344.93 It's a critical step that you can't bypass
2347.15 if you want muscles to contract
2348.53 and it's very temperature sensitive.
2352.52 Therefore, if you can
keep temperature lower,
2356.32 you can do more work per unit time,
2359.13 you can do more pull-ups
2360.78 and that actually was done by Craig
2362.891 and his colleagues, excuse me.
2364.52 The pull-ups weren't
actually done by Craig,
2366.03 I don't know how many
pull-ups Craig can do,
2367.41 I'll ask him next time,
both cooled and uncooled,
2369.99 how many pullups he can do.
2371.68 But what they essentially did
2373.33 is they brought someone
into their laboratory
2376.08 who could do 10 pull ups on the first set
2379.43 and they were able to get 10,
2381.17 rest two or three minutes get another 10,
2383.1 rest or three minutes and
if you've ever tried this,
2385.03 what you find is that you start dropping
2386.46 to eight, seven, six, et cetera.
2389.35 Now, the person might not necessarily feel
2391.92 like they're overheating,
but the muscle is heating up.
2395.38 Then with their knowledge that these AVAs,
2399.29 that these that these portals
in the palms are a great way
2404.32 to both heat the body, but also
to dump heat from the body,
2408.41 they used the device
2410.12 and I'll talk about
what you can do at home
2412.16 but a device where they had people hold on
2414.64 to what was essentially a cold tube.
2418.44 Now this is crucial, the
tube can't be so cold
2422.35 that it causes vasoconstriction
2424.4 because then the cold
won't pass from the tube
2427.31 to the hand and to the core.
2430.13 But if it's the right temperature,
2432.18 it's neither too hot nor too cold,
2434.85 that cool from the cold
tube passes into the hand,
2440.06 these so-called palmer regions
and then cools the core
2444.4 and in theory by lowering body temperature
2447.08 would allow the person or
the athlete to do more work
2450.35 and indeed that's what they saw.
2453.14 The actual data, the specific data showed
2455.8 that subjects could do,
2457.21 at least the subjects they worked with,
2458.69 on their first day with no
cooling about a hundred pull-ups
2462.31 across the timeframe that they had, okay?
2466.65 So it might've taken
anywhere from 10 to 15
2470.04 or maybe more sets depending
on how skilled that person was
2473.16 but in a fixed amount of time.
2475.9 Then they came back and did the cooling.
2478.33 They did it the very next day
2479.68 which if you've ever trained a muscle,
2481.92 the very next day typically
2483.74 you wouldn't do as well in its training
2486.01 if it took any damage
from the previous session
2487.96 or you at least do as well,
2489.12 but you probably wouldn't
do what they then observed,
2492.19 which was, they started
after every other set,
2494.75 the person would just hold the cold tube,
2497.2 cool down the body after every other set,
2499.71 rest everything else was kept the same
2502.11 and they found that they
went to 180 pull-ups,
2505.57 which is incredible, it's a near doubling.
2508.13 And by doing this repeatedly
over several sessions,
2511.01 over several weeks, they quickly
went in the cooling group
2515.07 from a maximum of somewhere
between 180 and 200 as I recall,
2518.86 I'm sort of estimating now,
2520.24 to 600 pull-ups in the
equivalent amount of time
2523.57 which is absolutely incredible.
2526.12 They then repeated this in
a study on the bench press
2529.56 and actually the bench press
study was pretty interesting
2531.72 because they actually had a control group
2533.67 that was admittedly
taking specific amounts
2536.95 of anabolic steroids,
2537.99 the antibiotic steroid
was testosterone cypionate
2540.63 which is essentially testosterone,
2543.43 and indeed the testosterone cypionate,
2545.43 the steroid group improved at
a rate of about 1% per week.
2551.04 There were differences
and the cooling group
2554.52 basically left all other
groups in the dust,
2557.45 it was just remarkable.
2558.71 So cooling the core, I
want to be very clear
2561.63 that it's not cooling the muscle,
2562.93 wasn't about cooling the chest alone
2564.76 or just cooling the palms,
2566.41 it was about allowing cold
to pass through the palms
2569.74 because of the unique vasculature
that's there, these AVAs
2574.44 allowed the subjects to do
far more work per unit time.
2578.63 And the important thing is that
2581.32 if they were to come back
after doing 600 pull-ups
2584.37 or 500 pull-ups, you might say,
2586.22 well, wow that's going
to create a situation
2588.45 where recovery is going to
be absolutely impossible.
2591.64 They could come back, not use the cooling
2593.68 and they still saw a
highly significant increase
2596.22 in the amount or the
number of pull-ups or dips
2599.08 or bench press weight
that they could do, okay?
2601.9 So what that meant is that
2602.9 it was both an excellent performance
2605.167 and an excellent training stimulus
2607.15 that they were able to recover from, okay?
2609.86 I don't know if all of
you are following this
2611.41 but these are the sorts of increases
2613.72 in exercise output that
are absolutely staggering
2617.18 and that's why professional
teams and the military
2619.94 and others capitalized on them
very quickly and use these.
2624.35 Okay, now you may be asking
what about endurance, right?
2629.73 Not everyone wants to be
able to bench press a lot
2632.48 for multiple reps and sets.
2635.08 And I should just mention
for the bench pressing,
2636.91 it was, I believe they were
2638.14 they found people that
could bench press two 25,
2640.51 so that's two 45 pound plates
2641.87 on the 45 pound standard Olympic bar
2644.0 for repetitions of anywhere from six to 10
2645.94 and then they had them do the same thing.
2647.1 They did a set, they'd
rest two or three minutes,
2649.41 sometimes up to four minutes,
2650.53 then do another set,
repeat, repeat, repeat,
2652.58 and with cooling, they were able
2654.08 to increase the amount of work,
2656.45 the number of reps with the same weight.
2659.13 Sometimes they did have to increase sets
2661.38 to approximately double,
so it was pretty fantastic.
2665.28 So with endurance, similar
increases have been shown
2669.91 and the way that they do those tests
2672.32 are a little bit different
2673.43 and they also point to a
really important mechanism
2676.19 of why we stopped doing work at all
2679.35 when we perceive that we are
putting in too much effort.
2682.31 So it gets right to the
heart of the relationship
2684.48 between temperature in
muscle and your willpower,
2687.96 those are directly related.
2689.37 Your body heat and your willpower
2691.91 are linked in a physiological way.
2694.04 So I'm not talking about the kind of stuff
2695.32 that you see as kind of like
clickbait on the internet,
2697.22 or like increase willpower
now or become resilient now,
2700.76 or never do this again if you
want to be mentally strong,
2703.06 I'm talking about a
physiological mechanism
2705.61 that exists in the body and
brain that causes you to stop
2709.03 or that will allow you to
continue to go harder and further
2712.91 than you normally would.
2714.42 Okay, so let's talk
about willpower and heat
2716.82 and how heat shuts you down.
2719.26 In other words, if you are cool,
2721.99 if your body temperature
is in a particular range,
2724.61 not only can you go further,
2726.4 but you will go further if you want to.
2730.69 Said differently, if you heat up too much,
2734.44 you will stop or you will die.
2737.28 Typically people stop, there
are individuals who will push
2739.81 to the point where they black out and die,
2741.32 in the same way that, and
please don't do this experiment,
2745.79 there are people who can
sit down face to face
2748.57 and say, let's hold our breath
2750.08 and whoever breathes first loses.
2753.53 Some people will just
go until it's painful
2755.66 and then they'll gasp
and take a big breath.
2758.17 There are always those individuals
2759.41 who can override that reflex
2761.2 and they will go until
they pass out, okay?
2763.76 And if you do that in water,
you can very easily die,
2766.56 so please don't do that experiment.
2769.12 But there's a reflex that
relates the body to the brain
2774.45 and the brain to the body
that shuts off our effort
2777.26 when we get too hot.
2778.97 So what Craig and his colleagues
and now others have done
2781.96 is to do a test in the laboratory
2783.56 where rather than ask
people to run outside
2786.51 until they absolutely
don't want to run anymore,
2789.67 you put them on a treadmill
and you set the speed, okay?
2792.66 So they have to keep up with the treadmill
2794.6 and at some point they quit.
2798.14 And you take groups and you do those
2801.24 in different temperature environments.
2804.3 So some people are running
in a nice chilly laboratory,
2808.39 they get their heart rate up.
2809.44 So maybe their heart rate goes from,
2812.0 you know, 40 or 50 baseline heart rate,
2814.33 maybe it gets up to 80 or a hundred
2816.13 and then they keep the rate of
the treadmill going the same
2819.81 and they'll just plateau.
2820.84 So they're getting into a
steady state cadence or rhythm
2823.54 and their heart is beating it
more or less a steady state.
2825.65 Eventually they'll probably stop
2827.27 'cause they have something else to do
2828.91 but people will continue
at that temperature
2833.96 and at that heart rate,
2835.82 unless you start turning up
the temperature in the room
2838.86 and at some point they will stop
2841.0 and they'll stop much
earlier when it gets hot
2844.07 because of something
called cardiac drift, okay?
2847.09 So let's say I'm running
2848.71 and I'm running at a steady
cadence on this treadmill
2851.33 and my heart rate is 85 beats per minute
2853.25 or a hundred beats per
minute, doesn't matter,
2854.72 let's say a hundred just
for sake of example.
2857.48 Well, just making the room hotter
2859.68 is going to increase
my heart rate further,
2862.43 even though I'm at the same output
2864.69 and the brain does a computation,
2868.23 it somehow figures out that
there's a heat component
2871.64 that's increasing heart rate
2872.87 and there's an effort
component from running
2875.19 that's driving heart rate.
2876.75 And if the heat component
and the heart rate output
2880.15 from the effort, get to hit
a certain threshold, I stop.
2884.5 Okay, ad some of you may think,
2886.01 well there are people who just run
2887.45 and run and run and never stop,
eventually everyone stops.
2891.37 Maybe it's because of the race ended,
2892.65 maybe it's because, you
know, everyone else quit.
2895.1 I actually saw some stuff online,
2896.9 there are these races where people
2898.01 just will continuously do the same loop
2899.84 until everyone else drops out
2901.29 and then one guy or girl
keeps going past everybody.
2905.41 But typically it stops
because the race is over
2907.54 or because people quit.
2909.19 Increasing temperature
increases the rate of quitting
2913.61 in part, not entirely, but in part
2915.74 because of this thing called cardiac drift
2918.2 which you've probably experienced
2920.13 if you've been out on a hot
day and you're walking uphill
2922.24 you might stop to take a breath.
2924.18 If you sit in a sauna, your
heart rate will increase.
2926.75 Heat increases heart rate,
effort increases heart rate.
2931.06 At a steady effort, you'll
have a steady heart rate.
2933.3 If you increase the
heat in the environment
2936.15 that you're engaging in
that steady heart rate,
2938.91 your heart rate will now
go up due to cardiac drift
2941.86 and you will quit, okay?
2944.03 So Heller and colleagues
have done experiments
2947.23 where they do palmer cooling
under these environments.
2950.96 And that's wonderful because
not only does it enable people
2955.29 to go further and faster for much longer
2960.35 that's been shown statistically
significant every time
2963.72 but it also protects the brain and body
2966.11 against hyperthermia,
overheating, coma, nerve injury,
2969.66 nerve death, and actual death, okay?
2972.337 So you can see why this
is such a valuable tool.
2975.73 So what are they doing?
2977.73 Well, in this case too they're
having them cool their hands
2981.86 and they're cooling the palms.
2983.41 Cooling the bottoms of the
feet is a little trickier
2985.7 but cooling the face could
actually work as well.
2987.987 And we're going to talk
about cooling the face
2989.68 and how to incorporate this.
2991.22 So at this point, I've just really wanted
2993.54 to impress upon you not impress
you, but impress upon you
2998.61 the fact that you have these
three surfaces of your body
3001.19 that are very good at
passing cold into the body,
3004.31 such that it cools the
core body temperature
3006.55 and that's a good thing
for health and safety
3009.87 and in order to maintain work output
3013.3 over longer periods of time,
or actually just do more work.
3016.09 I mean to me the result
is just so staggering
3018.15 is the hundred to 180
pull-ups in the controls
3021.44 and then 600 pull-ups in the
cooled individuals, right?
3026.0 They actually also feel mentally
3028.61 as if they can do more work.
3030.16 It's not just that they can,
3031.59 their willpower is adjusted somehow
3034.71 by these shifts in temperature.
3036.86 Now, before we continue
and get to the exact ways
3040.0 that any number of us can
start to use this information,
3043.57 I want to talk about the
opposite thing, which is heating.
3047.15 And you have to remember
that these surfaces,
3050.46 the palms and the bottoms
of the feet and the face
3052.433 will not just a range with these AVAs,
3055.81 these special ways to pass
blood from arteries to veins
3061.57 in order to cool us for
better athletic performance
3064.36 or to heat us for on cold days
but for both of those things.
3069.25 Now Heller and colleagues
and others have also explored
3072.9 how these can be used to heat up the core.
3076.14 There are times when we
want to heat up our core.
3079.28 Typically we hear that most of the heat
3081.95 escapes through our heads,
3083.25 so we'll put on a hat when we go outside,
3085.78 that's actually not true.
3087.91 Most of your heat escapes
through your face,
3090.52 the palms of your hands and
the bottoms of your feet.
3093.36 Now you should know why that's the case.
3096.44 What this means is that
for post-surgery patients
3100.85 or for people that are hypothermic,
3103.28 indeed you want to heat the core, right?
3105.57 But actually I was on a swim recently
3107.85 where a friend became hypothermic.
3110.04 He was kind of slurring his words
3112.08 and kind of staggering around
3113.25 when we got him back on the beach,
3114.95 we brought him over to
the lifeguard station,
3116.95 he turned out to be fine.
3117.93 Again, this is why cold water swims
3119.64 are something that you
really need to do in groups,
3121.5 not alone and you really have
to know what you're doing.
3124.16 There were reasons for why
this happened that day,
3128.02 but, you know we were basically
3129.9 people thought we were a little strange
3131.02 until they realized what was happening.
3132.55 We were walking down the beach
basically sandwiching him
3134.77 between at our chest
because we were still warmer
3138.45 than the ambient environment,
the environment around us.
3140.247 And we were pushing our chest against him
3143.16 to try and warm him up
to warm up his core.
3145.54 In retrospect, that was
the wrong thing to do.
3148.22 In talking with Craig and
talking to other colleagues
3150.9 that work on thermogenesis.
3153.38 What we should have done was warm,
3155.28 hit the palms of his hands,
the bottoms of his feet
3157.41 and his face because that
would insulate the heat loss.
3161.68 Now he was very cold
3162.9 so presumably there was vasoconstriction
3165.42 of the veins at these locations.
3167.92 And so it's not clear
3169.73 that that would have been
the only strategy to use
3171.81 but they have explored how to
heat up post-surgery patients
3176.15 and one of the best ways to do that
3177.56 is to get warm socks on
the bottoms of the feet,
3180.1 get gloves on the hands
3181.42 and if it can be done
safely to warm the face.
3183.61 Now, of course you don't
want to obstruct respiration
3185.54 and things of that sort.
3186.97 But again the ability to
pass heat into the body
3191.39 or to remove heat to the body
3192.93 is best done through these three surfaces.
3195.44 I can't emphasize that enough.
3197.33 So I mentioned before that
you want to cool the palms
3200.86 or the bottoms of the feet
3201.95 although that's a little
harder to do or the face
3203.7 but not so much that the
blood vessels constrict
3208.03 because then you won't be able
to pass cool into the body
3210.42 because those pipes got smaller
3212.7 and therefore you can't
pass cool into the body.
3215.79 So how can you start to incorporate this?
3217.7 Well, Craig and colleagues have a company
3220.42 that they've spun out through Stanford.
3223.13 We'll talk about that when
we sit down with Craig
3225.22 that has made engineered devices
that are optimal for this
3229.32 that are going to keep
those passages open,
3232.68 keep the size of the, those
veins correct to pass cool
3235.69 into the body quickly for sake
of elite sports performance
3238.37 and even recreational sports performance
3240.21 but you can actually
start to incorporate this.
3242.77 First of all, I always get asked
3245.77 how cold should the water be?
3247.18 Should it be ice water?
3248.61 Should it be very cold water?
3250.81 The answer is no.
3253.45 If you want to experience
some of this effect
3255.77 without a device, one thing you could do
3257.71 would be for instance to do, I dunno,
3260.11 I'll use the, the, the gym or
the treadmill as an example.
3262.83 You could do your maximum
number of pull-ups, stop
3266.58 and then you could actually
put your hands into
3269.98 or on the surface of a sink
that is presumably stopped up
3274.97 with cool water.
3277.28 So not ice water, not
freezing cold, but cool water,
3282.16 slightly cooler than body temperature
3285.44 before you started training
would be a good place to start.
3289.0 You do that for 10 to 30 seconds.
3291.148 Then you could go back
and do your next set.
3294.21 You would repeat the cooling,
3295.72 you would want to extend the
amount of cooling somewhat
3298.03 so you might want to do that
for 30 seconds to a minute.
3300.7 This is not going to be perfect,
3301.83 you're going to have to play
with how cold to make it
3304.66 in order to get the optimal effect
3306.64 but you ought to see
an effect nonetheless.
3309.49 The same is true if you're
running and you're fatiguing,
3312.9 obviously you don't want
to become hyperthermic,
3315.35 cooling the hands or the
bottoms of your feet or the face
3318.88 would be the ideal way to dump heat
3320.67 in order to be able to
generate more output.
3323.79 Now, the face is something
3325.26 that we haven't talked a lot about.
3327.65 Everything I've told you
up until now also says
3329.66 that if you are somebody
who tends to get cold
3331.87 when you are outside, say in
the winter or even in the fall,
3335.17 you tend to run cold, warming your face
3338.18 is going to be the most important thing
3339.61 that you can do.
3340.87 Now, it's kind of hard to do
that without looking strange
3343.28 like wearing a ski mask
or something like that
3345.33 but that is going to be more effective
3347.35 than covering and warming
any other part of your body
3350.53 although it'd be quite strange
if you only had a ski mask on
3352.96 and you weren't wearing clothes
anywhere else on your body,
3354.93 I don't recommend doing that outside,
3356.97 that will get you into all
sorts of other kinds of trouble.
3359.25 That wouldn't be good for anybody.
3360.97 But now you understand the
principle and the locations
3364.54 at which to deliver heat and cold.
3366.67 So let's say that you are out for a run
3369.75 and you want to incorporate
this cooling mechanism,
3372.42 I talked to Craig about this,
3373.5 I said, what would be the
kind of poor person's approach
3376.75 to this before this devices
commercially available?
3379.23 And he said, well, you, you
could take a frozen juice can,
3384.36 if you have one of those
or a very cold can of soda
3387.04 and you would want to
pass it back and forth
3390.0 between your two hands.
3391.68 The reason the passing back
and forth is really important
3394.36 is because you, again you
don't want it to be so cold
3396.43 that you constrict those veins portals
3400.28 that it will allow cold
to go into the body.
3403.33 Now, there are certainly people
3405.63 that are working on bike handles,
3407.36 and that can actually cool the hands.
3409.77 You can expect with
the Olympics coming up,
3411.4 people are aware of these data
3412.99 and are starting to incorporate
it into a number of things.
3415.58 Here's what you don't want to
do and there are sports teams
3418.49 that I won't mention by name or brand
3420.11 that have made this mistake
and it costs them dearly.
3423.95 You don't want to cool the core
3426.35 if you want to cool the body, right?
3429.26 If it's very hot day and
you're going to train,
3431.7 getting into an ice bath first,
sure it will cool you down,
3436.51 but it's not going to be as
effective as cooling the palms,
3440.08 the bottoms of the feet and the face.
3442.9 I have a friend who does some
important work in this space
3446.47 with people in various,
let's just say cultures
3449.17 where heat is generated quite a lot
3451.05 and they need to dump heat,
ice packs delivered to the face
3454.47 are something that they actually use
3456.19 in order to dump heat quickly.
3458.05 Now, again, you don't want
3459.44 to keep the ice pack on your face.
3460.93 These are people that are
very high work output, right?
3463.76 Firefighters and similar,
at very high work output
3467.5 and then they'll put this essentially,
3469.77 it's like a cool face mask on their face.
3473.09 It allow their core body
temperature come down
3474.717 and then they remove it,
3475.72 they're not keeping it on there so long
3477.12 that they're getting the
vasoconstriction, okay?
3479.83 So there are a number of
ways that you could do this.
3482.1 And again, I'm not giving
specific temperatures
3484.77 because it depends on how hot that day
3486.26 and how hot your body temperature is.
3487.67 So you can see why there's a
need to create more devices
3490.17 for this, but you can see
a considerable improvement
3495.33 in endurance, in strength
and in all kinds of explosive
3500.14 and sort of, you know,
explosive power type output
3503.3 in athletics by using
these surfaces of the hands
3507.25 and bottoms of the feet and face.
3510.04 The one that I've tried
3511.56 because in anticipation of
this episode was the dips
3515.92 where then I would cool my hands,
3517.52 I actually decided to cool the
bottoms of my feet as well,
3519.874 because it just feels good
3520.707 and it's particularly hot out lately,
3521.78 so no shoes or socks on,
3523.84 put my feet into the bottoms of my feet
3526.68 just kind of hovering
about a centimeter or two
3529.15 below the surface of a bucket of water
3531.36 that was just slightly, it felt cool,
3533.33 slightly cooler than
body temperature or so.
3536.84 It just basically what
came out of the spigot
3538.64 after I let it run for a little bit.
3540.61 And indeed I saw a 60% increase
3543.78 in the number of dips I
can do in a single session.
3546.01 So it's actually a
quite significant effect
3548.56 and you don't have to be perfectly precise
3550.26 in order to do it.
3551.61 And of course, if you want to
heat up for whatever reason,
3554.13 like you're camping or you're
lost in the environment,
3557.61 remember these three surfaces
3559.32 are going to be the best
way to heat your as well.
3562.4 So up until now, we've been
talking about how to use cold
3565.4 during a workout in order
to improve performance
3568.46 and indeed cold applied
3570.5 to the appropriate parts of
the body, the appropriate times
3573.97 can vastly improve our performance
3576.547 and endurance and strength.
3579.1 Now, I want to talk about
the use of temperature
3581.21 in particular cold to improve the speed
3584.642 and the depth of recovery.
3587.91 Recovery is obviously vital, right?
3590.48 During a weight training session
3591.91 or during an endurance session,
3593.61 that's just the stimulus for
getting better the next time
3596.46 and if you don't recover, you
not only won't get better,
3598.91 but you'll get worse.
3601.182 There's a lot of interest
in the use of cold
3604.44 in order to improve
recovery in the short term.
3608.43 We see this and probably
the best example of this
3610.89 would be fighters in combat sports
3613.24 between rounds or athletes during
3617.25 in between quarters or halftime,
3619.23 that's one form of recovery.
3620.67 The ability to go back
into the sport very soon
3623.73 on an order of minutes,
anywhere from like one minute
3626.31 in between rounds and
typical combat sports
3628.85 or several minutes and
a half time, et cetera.
3633.13 Typically what we see is
people cooling their core,
3637.41 cooling the back of their neck,
3639.03 cooling the top of their heads.
3640.07 So it might be, you know,
a sponge with cold water
3642.91 over the top of the head
3644.05 or an ice pack on the back of the neck,
3646.01 or in some cases even
wearing cold ice vests,
3649.527 that's actually been done.
3651.62 That's going to be a very inefficient way
3653.76 to improve recovery of that kind.
3656.12 Far better would be to cool the face,
3659.03 the palms of the hands
or the bottoms the feet
3660.86 for the reasons that I
described up until now.
3664.09 Submerging the body in an ice
bath, or taking a cold shower,
3668.6 say up to the neck or up to the chest
3671.41 or getting under cold water
or jumping in a cold lake
3674.06 or something of that sort,
or in the locker room,
3676.22 getting under the cold shower
also would be a terrible way
3679.92 to cool off the body quickly
3681.91 compared to the ways that I described
3684.44 through the palms of the
hands, the bottoms of the feet
3686.53 or the face for the following reason.
3689.35 First of all, it's not optimizing
those portals of the face,
3692.35 palms the hands and the feet
3694.13 and in addition, if it's
very cold and you submerge
3698.02 or you cover a lot of
the body with that cold,
3701.72 you're going to cause constriction
3703.7 of the very vessels and pathways
3706.12 that allow the body to
efficiently dump heat.
3709.22 So again, the key thing
is to cool these one
3713.76 or two or three of these surfaces
3715.81 but not so cold that you
cause the vasoconstriction.
3719.899 So what does this mean for you?
3722.49 It means that getting in an
ice bath or a cold shower
3724.99 or putting an ice pack
on the back of your neck
3727.49 in most cases is not going to be as good
3729.77 as splashing cold water on your face
3731.58 or even just holding your
face in a damp cool cloth
3735.13 or something of that sort.
3738.05 It seems kind of counterintuitive,
3739.41 you think, oh if I just
jump into an ice bath,
3741.63 I'm going to cool down much faster
than if I just cooled these,
3745.37 you know one or two or three
3747.07 of these select regions of the body
3748.41 but that's actually not the case.
3750.27 And then of course
3751.103 there's recovery that occurs
from session to session.
3753.78 So outside of the game or the
match or the exercise session
3759.47 and many people are now relying
on things like cryotherapy
3763.77 which requires a lot
of expensive equipment,
3765.52 big, you know liquid
nitrogen driven machine.
3769.85 Those aren't so common for most people
3771.69 or accessible for most
people, but a lot of people
3773.68 are using cold baths or
ice baths or cold showers.
3776.84 And again, that's not
going to optimize recovery.
3779.98 In fact, it's going to
have an additional effect
3782.35 that is going to potentially
block the training stimulus.
3786.24 When you get into an ice
bath indeed, there are,
3789.49 provided it's not very, very cold,
3791.92 if you get into a cold shower,
3792.92 provided is not very, very cold,
3794.3 you are indeed blocking
some of the inflammation
3797.74 that occurs because of
the training session.
3800.29 But in doing so you also
are blocking pathways,
3804.08 such as mTOR, mammalian
target of rapamycin,
3807.616 which are involved in the adaptation
3809.53 for a muscle to become stronger or bigger.
3812.1 Put simply, covering the body in cold
3815.27 or immersing the body
in cold after training
3818.98 can short circuit or
prevent the hypertrophy
3821.54 or muscle growth response.
3823.54 It has other effects that
can be positive, right?
3826.04 It can induce thermogenesis, et cetera,
3828.36 it can reduce inflammation
3829.67 but it can prevent some of the
positive effects of exercise.
3833.74 Now, it hasn't been examined
so much for endurance work
3836.96 but let's say you come back
from around of endurance work
3840.08 or run or a bike or a swim,
getting into a cool bath
3845.69 or cooling the palms, the
bottoms of the feet or the face,
3848.52 in my opinion, based on
the science would be better
3851.44 than completely immersing
the body in the ice bath
3855.25 or the cold shower.
3856.57 There is a time and a place
3858.21 for the use of the ice
bath or the cold shower
3860.42 or the cold plunge, those tend to be
3863.41 when you want to deliberately
3864.66 increase brown fat thermogenesis
3867.18 or when you want to deliberately
work on mental resilience.
3871.74 And in a subsequent episode on fat loss
3873.79 I'm going to talk about how
to optimize the use of cold
3876.08 specifically for increasing
metabolism and fat loss.
3880.09 But for now, since we're
talking about the use of cold
3883.29 for improving performance and recovery,
3886.34 the suggestion that I'm going
to provide is based on the work
3889.76 of Craig Heller and colleagues
that I've been talking about
3891.88 as well as a excellent book
I mainly rely on textbooks
3895.92 and special volume books which
are collections of papers
3899.41 from experts in a particular area
3900.96 that go beyond standard kind
of college level textbooks.
3903.88 The one that I've been relying on
3904.96 is called "Thermoregulation
in Human Performance,
3907.52 Physiological and Biological
Aspects" by Effie Marino.
3911.4 I don't know the publisher,
I don't know the author.
3913.86 I do recognize some of the names
3915.18 of the particular papers there,
but I just want to be clear
3917.56 there's no sort of business
relationship or deal with them
3920.32 but it's an excellent text,
3921.41 it's called "Thermoregulation
in Human Performance".
3923.39 You can find it online
3925.11 if you want to go really deep into this
3926.94 but basically what they show is that
3928.5 if you can cool the body back
to its resting temperature,
3932.81 for and by resting temperature, I mean
3935.47 within the range that you would see
3937.07 at any time of waking
day, but not in exercise.
3940.57 So just bringing that the body
temperature down to baseline.
3944.67 If you can do that,
3945.68 the sooner you can do
that after a workout,
3947.82 the sooner that the muscle will recover,
3950.49 that the tendons will recover
3951.79 and that the person you
3953.35 can get back into more endurance training,
3955.56 more weight training, et cetera.
3957.16 So cold actually can be a very
powerful tool for recovery
3961.08 but to maximize return to
baseline levels of temperature,
3965.77 it's my belief based on the studies
3968.35 that are published in this book
3969.8 as well as my discussions with
my colleague, Craig Heller
3972.21 and in reviewing the literature overall
3974.98 that just simply cooling the entire body
3976.98 by jumping into an ice
bath or a cold shower
3979.06 is not the best way to go.
3980.53 You really want to rely
on one of these three
3983.14 glaborous skin portals of the palms,
3984.618 the bottoms of the feet or the face.
3987.05 So now you probably know more
than you ever wanted to know
3990.43 about how we regulate body temperature
3992.27 and how it can be applied to exercise
3994.85 both during the exercise session
3997.15 and afterward to optimize recovery.
4001.29 Many of us, all of us, presumably
4003.68 are also eating and drinking
things and taking things
4006.29 at various times that
can impact this process.
4009.67 And so, because of that, we should ask
4013.07 whether or not those things
are impacting body temperature.
4016.69 And when we do that, we find
that there are certain things
4019.41 that many of us are doing
4020.4 that are actually
impairing our performance.
4023.42 So for instance, if you are
taking a pre-workout drink
4026.61 or you're ingesting a lot of
caffeine or other substance
4029.99 to bring your body temperature
up before exercise,
4033.64 you are limiting the amount
of exercise that you can do.
4038.01 I can recall a time in college
4039.64 when I would drink a lot of espresso
4042.27 back then ephedrine was
sold over the counter,
4045.89 I remember taking it,
4047.0 it will really energize you for workouts.
4050.34 You can generate a lot of energy
4053.09 and get extremely focused
taking those things.
4055.21 They do increase heart rate,
they can be quite dangerous,
4057.86 I don't recommend people take them.
4059.21 In fact, I think ephedrine
is now off the shelves
4061.68 as a non prescription compound
4064.71 because various people died from taking it
4066.55 who were sensitive to
it or exercised in heat.
4069.26 But looking back at that,
4070.76 I realized it was a foolish approach.
4073.14 It was increasing core thermogenesis.
4075.34 Sure I might've burned a few more calories
4077.86 but actually when I look at the data
4080.27 that are coming from specific cooling
4082.98 and how that can so
increase in performance
4086.56 if done properly and then I
compare that to the effects
4090.04 of taking some sort of thermogenic
compound, whatever it is
4093.07 some pre-workout or some pill
or high levels of caffeine,
4097.19 it's very clear that
increasing body temperature
4100.37 prior to working out is
the exact wrong thing
4102.96 that one would want to do.
4104.39 You don't want to stay so cold
4105.96 that you can't generate
good muscle contractions.
4108.01 You don't want to be like I am
coming out of the cold ocean,
4111.4 you know, with claws for hands
4113.14 but one wants to have your
body temperature in a range
4116.62 that still allows you to
work hard and perform well.
4121.33 Now, in terms of recovery,
things like alcohol,
4125.43 we know our vasodilator.
4126.96 So those are going to cause
people to drop body temperature.
4130.47 So you might think, oh, well
that sounds great for recovery
4132.637 and I don't think people
should be drinking who are
4135.09 you know, have problems
with alcohol intake,
4137.27 you know, alcoholics
4138.42 or they're not of drinking age, et cetera.
4140.4 I'm not a drinker, but
I do have a good friend
4142.35 who's a quite accomplished athlete
4144.2 who basically drinks a beer or two
4146.51 after his long runs or cycling
and you know, his argument
4150.83 is well, I'm dumping body
heat and I like a beer
4153.71 and he's probably right, it's
probably a really good tool
4156.52 provided you don't have
issues with alcohol
4158.45 that would preclude that as a tool
4160.16 or you're not of drinking age.
4162.89 But anything that you
ingest after exercise
4166.34 that would increase body temperature
4168.08 is going to impede recovery.
4170.01 Anything that you do that
lowers body temperature
4172.24 provides it's in safe ranges
4174.7 is going to accelerate recovery.
4177.12 And that brings us to the
whole host of compounds
4179.9 that people take that can
increase body temperature.
4184.34 And many people are taking these things
4185.95 in order to increase fat
burning and increase metabolism
4189.22 but in my opinion
4190.45 it's impeding their
ability to perform well.
4193.43 And especially if the performance
4195.64 is something that you're focused on
4197.42 aside from body recomposition,
losing fat building muscle.
4201.66 But even if you're focused on
losing fat, building muscle
4204.05 you have to ask yourself, is
the body temperature increase
4207.16 that I'm getting from these
compounds really worth it
4210.21 given that it can block
or prevent my performance
4214.25 from being as good as it could?
4216.44 In other words, is it
worth taking something
4218.37 that makes you feel very
energized to go work out
4220.42 but then you now know that
you are stopping earlier
4223.57 and you're performing
less well, fewer reps,
4225.76 fewer steps overall, is it worth it?
4229.07 If you had not taken that thing
4230.66 then you could perform much longer
4233.73 and at much higher capacity.
4237.11 Some of you are probably
saying, well, that's ridiculous
4239.29 because when I drink a quadruple espresso
4242.01 and I pop a whatever pre-workout
or drink a pre-workout
4245.46 then I know I can go much further.
4247.7 Ah, that might be true but
the increase in temperature
4251.39 is also costing you on the recovery side.
4254.0 And unless you're doing other things
4256.15 to improve your recovery and
I know many people that are,
4258.73 I don't judge but many people
who are doing those things
4260.93 are also augmenting their recovery
4262.38 through hormone augmentation
4263.88 and other performance enhancing tools,
4267.38 then for the typical
person who's not doing that
4269.73 it's probably shooting
yourself in the foot.
4271.74 So let's take a look at what
some of those compounds are
4274.12 and what they and just briefly review
4276.66 whether or not they would be a
good or a bad idea to include
4279.42 if your main goals are performance
4281.68 or your main goals are
body recomposition or both.
4284.61 So let's just briefly discuss stimulants.
4286.63 This could be caffeine,
4287.66 this could be any other kind of stimulant
4290.26 that are typically in a pre-workout drink
4293.27 or anything that might get you
revved up before exercising.
4296.4 This could even be very strong tea,
4298.15 I've mentioned I'm a big consumer of mate.
4300.2 I like a yerba mate, I love that stuff
4303.34 and I also drink caffeine.
4305.033 I drink love coffee of various kinds
4306.99 mushroom coffee, black
coffee, espresso, et cetera.
4310.47 I'm a chronic caffeine user,
I don't think I'm an addict
4314.38 but I'm a chronic caffeine user.
4317.04 Meaning when I drink caffeine
4318.86 my heart rate doesn't increase so much
4321.05 that it feels like a shock to my system.
4323.68 Some people are not caffeine adapted
4325.71 or they're very caffeine sensitive.
4327.76 Here's the straightforward rule.
4329.93 Caffeine for somebody who
doesn't drink caffeine very much
4334.19 will constrict the blood vessels
4335.98 and will increase retention of body heat
4338.84 and it's probably a bad
idea before exercise.
4341.76 For somebody who's caffeine adapted
4344.41 and is used to drinking caffeine,
4346.62 it won't have that
vasoconstriction effect,
4348.64 that's what the data point
too, because I'm adapted to it
4352.21 but it will cause vasodilation
4354.54 and will allow me to dump body heat.
4355.99 So for me, I use it before I train
4358.43 or do any kind of exercise
4359.84 because I tend to do
that early in the day,
4361.24 it won't prevent me from sleeping
4362.74 and it causes vasodilation.
4364.86 And then afterwards I'm aware
4366.55 that it causes vasoconstriction
4368.24 after the caffeine wears off.
4370.06 So for somebody who drinks two or three
4372.49 or more cups of coffee
a day or mate a day,
4375.38 so we're talking intake
4376.32 of anywhere from a hundred to
400 milligrams of caffeine,
4380.12 what you want to do is
you want to make sure
4382.82 that you would do that before exercise
4386.15 and probably not after exercise,
4388.58 not just makes logical sense
4390.4 given what we know about
thermal regulation.
4392.29 And if you're somebody who
doesn't drink caffeine,
4394.7 drinking caffeine before a workout
4396.66 is going to be about the worst thing
4397.853 that you could possibly do
4399.0 because it's going to
increase core body temperature
4401.13 through its thermogenic effects
4402.79 and it's going to constrict
your blood vessels
4405.26 and make it even harder to dump heat.
4407.37 So I don't suggest that
people drink caffeine or not,
4411.24 I just suggest that you think about
4413.23 whether or not your
caffeine adapted or not,
4415.67 and decide whether or not
you want to drink caffeine.
4417.93 In general, you're going to be
better not drinking any caffeine
4421.32 than you are drinking caffeine
4423.43 unless you're a heavy
caffeine user or abuser.
4425.93 In which case not drinking caffeine
4427.83 is going to give you vicious headaches
4429.43 and is going to make it
very hard to get motivated
4431.85 because you're just not used to it.
4433.12 It takes about three weeks
to get used to no caffeine.
4437.05 It's brutal, I've done it
before, I've done caffeine fast,
4440.0 I don't know that I ever
want to do it again,
4441.38 that's how painful it was.
4442.99 But you get headaches
4444.44 because of the effects on
vasodilation and constriction.
4447.46 If you like caffeine
use in moderate amounts
4450.0 and use it before your not after.
4452.02 If you don't like caffeine or
you don't use it very often,
4454.26 stay away from it
anywhere close to exercise
4456.46 before or after for that matter.
4458.87 One of the more commonly used compounds
4461.93 that's sold over the counter
4463.44 are non-steroid anti-inflammatories
4466.27 so things like Tylenol and
Advil and other trade names
4469.03 and Neproxin sodium things of that sort,
4471.15 almost all of those drop body
temperature to some extent.
4476.11 And that's why it's often recommended
4478.64 that people take them
when they have a fever
4480.66 although the whole business
4482.5 of dropping body temperature artificially
4484.33 when you have a fever is itself
an interesting discussion
4487.4 whether or not that's the most
adaptive or best thing to do
4490.34 certainly you don't want
fever to go too high,
4491.95 can be very dangerous, can kill you
4493.96 but artificially dropping body temperature
4497.19 with these compounds can be tricky.
4499.57 Now, a number of athletes
especially endurance athletes
4502.81 will rely on these non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs
4506.24 specifically to keep
body temperature lower
4509.29 during long bouts of exertion.
4511.58 This is a little bit of
a pharmacologic version
4514.61 of dumping heat instead
of using palmer cooling
4519.47 or you know, face ice pack cooling,
4522.67 they're relying on pharmacology
4524.15 to drop their core body temperature.
4526.44 That has certain obvious advantages,
4530.0 those advantages should be obvious
4532.04 and the reasons for them should be obvious
4533.84 based on everything we've
talked about up until now
4535.76 lower temperature allows
you to go further harder
4537.64 with more intensity.
4539.55 However, they do have effects on the liver
4542.5 and they can also have
effects on the kidneys
4545.06 and during long bouts of exercise
4546.84 or even short bouts of exercise,
4548.07 water balance and salt balance
are also going to be vital
4551.5 to maintain in order to perform well,
4555.4 generate the best muscle
contraction, stay mentally alert
4558.15 and also to stay alive.
4559.5 We will do an episode on
salt electrolytes and water
4563.24 and water balance but you
probably want to think carefully
4567.12 about whether or not
4568.35 you want to use non-steroid
anti-inflammatories
4570.5 before any training session
4572.45 just for the performance
augmentation effect
4575.44 unless you're working
carefully with a coach
4578.32 whether or not you've
done that in practices
4580.49 and of course, whether or
not you are in a situation
4584.32 where monitoring your
body temperature carefully
4586.9 is going to be important.
4587.87 You might ask, well, when would that be?
4589.18 Well, desert races, summer
training and races, winter rides,
4594.15 you certainly don't want
to get too cool either.
4596.35 So alcohol, caffeine and
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
4601.29 because of their effects on temperature
4602.95 will impact performance and recovery
4605.23 but you want to be cautious
about how you approach them.
4607.52 I personally am more a
fan of using caffeine
4611.23 in moderate doses for the
reasons I described before
4614.06 as well to use the cooling of the palms,
4616.7 cooling of the bottoms of my feet, right,
4620.14 by placing them into a
bucket or into a cool bath
4623.92 after training or cooling
the face after training
4627.23 or sometimes even during training.
4628.9 It just seems like
there's more of a margin
4630.68 to play with the variables,
to heat up the water
4632.73 or cool it down a little
bit to include one palm
4637.08 or the other palm.
4638.25 There's all sorts of good parameter space
4641.9 as we call it in science
that you can play with
4643.7 and work with to find what works for you
4645.84 whereas when you pop a pill,
sure you can adjust the dose
4649.57 and you can adjust it next time
4651.03 but once it's in you, it's in you
4652.44 and there's going to
be some period of time
4654.11 before you can modulate it.
4655.95 What I've offered today
4657.72 are ways in which you can use temperature
4659.97 to powerfully improve performance.
4662.76 And if you think about it,
4663.63 you can vary that from set to set,
4665.41 you could do your pull ups or your sprints
4668.02 and then cool your palms,
4669.75 and then try and go with
colder water the next round
4672.71 or warmer water the next round
4674.38 or do both feet and palms and face.
4676.42 I mean, you can do all sorts
of things moment to moment
4678.63 and see what works for you again
4680.8 essentially zero cost or no cost.
4682.92 Whereas when you pop
something, you take a pill,
4686.28 you're basically in that regimen
4688.41 for the next hour or two or more.
4690.51 You can always take more, but
you can't really take less.
4693.02 You can't really extract it
from your body in real time
4695.2 so it doesn't give you
a lot of opportunity
4697.12 to play scientists, which
is what I like to do
4699.69 because what I'm always trying to do
4701.22 is trying to dial in the
best protocols possible
4703.97 based on the mechanisms and data.
4705.57 And if you can do that moment to moment
4706.96 that places you in a position of power.
4709.26 Once again, we covered a lot of material.
4711.92 By now, after seeing this episode
4714.02 or listening to this episode,
you should understand a lot
4717.21 about how your body heats and cools itself
4719.96 and the value of that
for physical performance.
4723.27 I hope you'll also appreciate
4724.52 that you have tools at your disposal
4726.46 to vastly improve your
physical performance.
4729.52 And should you try those,
please let us know how it goes.
4733.23 If you decide to do palmer
cooling during your runs
4735.7 or after your runs, during
your weight workouts,
4738.78 during your yoga sessions,
whatever it is, let us know,
4741.29 please place that in the comments.
4743.42 I've given you specific
protocols and some direction,
4746.81 but I've also left it slightly vague
4749.0 because it, as I mentioned earlier
4751.03 I don't know all the
environmental conditions,
4752.8 I don't know how hot your yoga studio is
4754.85 or how cool your gym happens to be
4756.55 or your body temperature or time of day.
4759.38 Remember your temperature will vary
4761.12 according to the time of day,
4762.27 we did a whole episode
about that related to sleep.
4764.74 Typically your body temperature
is rising early in the day
4767.84 and is coming down as you
approach the late evening
4770.85 and late night hours for sleep,
in the middle of the night
4773.15 your temperature is very low
4774.76 at its absolute lowest
4775.77 something we call the temperature minimum.
4777.46 So we don't know exactly where you're at.
4780.13 You need to take the information
that you receive today
4782.89 and should you try and incorporate it
4785.13 try and do it intelligently.
4786.42 Don't cool yourself off
so much that you know
4789.71 become cryogenic and please
don't warm yourself up.
4792.55 In fact, we didn't talk at
all about warming yourself up
4795.56 because warming yourself up too
much can be quite dangerous.
4799.03 You never, ever, ever
want to be hypothermic,
4801.55 that's what your body and your
brain are trying to avoid.
4804.8 We talked a little bit about supplements
4807.72 but not the standard sorts of supplements
4809.59 I usually list off on these episodes.
4811.57 Rather, we talked about caffeine,
4814.05 non-steroid anti-inflammatories
4815.9 and how those can impact temperature,
4817.19 how alcohol can impact temperature.
4819.097 And I should just mention in closing
4821.12 that every time we eat, we
also increased temperature.
4823.41 There's a eating induced
thermogenic effect
4826.02 but that's a minor one,
that's a small one.
4827.9 So you wouldn't worry about
eating before training
4831.77 because of its effects on temperature
4833.26 because it tends to be really minor.
4836.01 Going forward, we're going to
talk more about temperature
4838.47 and other ways to improve
physical performance
4841.83 and skill learning.
4842.68 We're going to talk about specific ways
4844.66 to accelerate fat loss,
to improve muscle growth,
4848.78 to improve suppleness and flexibility.
4852.42 These approaches and
mechanisms are anchored deeply
4856.59 in neuroscience and physiology
and the relationship
4859.34 between our peripheral
organs, which include our skin
4862.62 and our brain and all
the organs in between.
4865.67 So it's really a pleasure for
me because I'm able to look
4868.73 to the textbook literature that exists
4871.12 and really came out over the
last 50 to a hundred years
4874.45 and unlike a lot of areas of neuroscience
4876.42 which are still sort of mystical,
4878.37 like consciousness and dreaming,
4880.22 of which we understand a little bit
4881.41 about these core mechanisms
of temperature and physiology
4884.62 which are so powerful,
involve very concrete studies
4889.11 that as you learn today
are very actionable.

4954.68 Today we didn't focus so
heavily on supplements,
4956.73 but in other episodes I have,
4958.31 and there are certainly supplements
4960.16 that are beneficial for sleep,
4961.79 for performance, for learning,
4964.04 immunity and so forth.
4965.89 We've partnered with
Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com,
4970.95 because Thorne supplements
4972.93 we believe to be the most stringent
4974.95 in terms of what they put on the bottle
4977.87 is actually what's in the bottle,
so the amounts are precise
4980.34 and the quality of the
ingredients is very precise.
4982.57 They partner with the Mayo Clinic,
4984.17 all the major sports teams
4985.36 so we're delighted that
we're partnered with Thorne.
4987.18 If you want to see the
supplements that I take
4989.12 you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman
4993.88 and you can see the
supplements that I take,
4995.5 you could get 20% off
any of those supplements
4998.18 should you choose to order them
4999.45 as well as 20% off any other supplements
5001.91 that Thorne happens to make.
5003.54 That's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman
5009.48 to get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorne makes.
5013.26 And last but not least,
5014.48 I want to thank you for
your time and attention.
5016.86 I realize this is a lot of information,
5018.99 I hope you'll find some
of it to be actionable
5020.71 and useful for you and
for people that you know
5023.13 and as always thank you for
your interest in science.
