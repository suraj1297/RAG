0.833 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
1.92 where we discuss science
3.207 and science-based tools for everyday life.
9.36 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.35 and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
12.799 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.791 Today, we're talking all about fasting.
17.552 And anytime we're talking about fasting,
20.27 we are also talking about eating,
22.07 because we all need to
eat sooner or later.
24.74 We're going to talk about how fasting
26.038 and when we eat influences
29.216 a large range of aspects
31.343 of our health and wellbeing,
both physical and mental.
35.59 So, well, nowadays,
36.76 most people are familiar with
the term intermittent fasting,
40.323 also sometimes called
time-restricted feeding.
43.651 I think most people
don't really understand
46.082 how that process works.
47.768 It's sort of obvious that
intermittent fasting,
50.45 aka time-restricted feeding,
52.398 involves eating at certain
periods of each 24-hour cycle,
56.35 or maybe even not eating for
entire days, in some cases.
59.812 But, if you think about it,
everybody sleeps eventually.
63.345 And therefore, because people
don't eat during their sleep,
67.581 almost everybody is employing some form
70.64 of intermittent fasting or
time-restricted feeding.
73.93 What we're going to talk about today
75.42 is how particular schedules
of time restricted feeding
79.384 can impact our health in different ways.
82.34 And when I say different ways, I mean,
84.16 we're going to talk about
how intermittent fasting,
86.828 aka time-restricted feeding,
impacts weight loss,
90.588 fat loss in particular,
92.317 muscle maintenance, and
loss and gain, organ health,
96.63 such as gut health and
liver health, the genome,
100.2 the epigenome, inflammation,
sickness, recovery,
105.26 and healing from sickness,
exercise, cognition,
108.87 mood, and lifespan.
110.91 So we're going to cover a
tremendous amount of information.
113.42 I promise to make it
all directly accessible,
116.39 regardless of whether or not you have
117.74 a background in biology and
metabolic science or not.
122.026 I'm also going to talk
about a lot of tools.
124.71 In fact, I'm going to discuss
126.36 a number of tools during today's episode
128.451 that actually make it such
130.179 that you don't have to
follow any feeding schedule,
133.988 or fasting schedule, same thing
136.55 if you think about it,
137.89 in any absolutely strict regimented way,
142.056 meaning if you were to only
eat during an eight hour period
146.38 of each day, most of the time,
147.86 but then occasionally eat
across a 12 hour period
150.21 of the day,
151.249 in theory, that could
actually have pretty serious
154.7 detrimental health effects.
156.26 And yet, there are things that you can do
157.705 to attenuate those negative effects.
160.31 In fact,
161.143 there are things that
you can do and or take
162.815 that can make it as if
you did not eat at all.
166.235 And so we'll discuss what those tools are.
168.324 And in many cases, for sake
of health, weight loss,
171.66 and performance,
172.52 making the body think that
it did not eat at all can
175.595 actually be quite beneficial.
177.469 So today, we're going to cover mechanism
179.163 and we're going to cover tools.
181.05 Before we do that,
182.14 I want to highlight a particular
result that was published
184.82 recently, because it
serves as a useful backbone
187.083 as we wade into the
conversation about fasting.
190.442 This is a study that was published
192.93 in the journal Cell Metabolism:
A Cell Press Journal,
195.88 excellent journal.
197.16 And the title of the paper
is "Fasting Blood Glucose
200.9 as a Predictor of Mortality:
Lost in Translation".
204.477 And I'll explain what
the "Lost in Translation"
206.74 part means in a moment.
207.736 But the basic takeaway of this study,
209.827 and I should mention that
210.9 the first author of the
study is Palliyaguru,
213.763 PALLIYAGURU, guru,
218.734 Palliyaguru, et al.
222.77 The basic finding of the
study is that in humans,
225.96 higher blood glucose is
associated with mortality.
231.402 And in fact, if you look at blood glucose,
234.3 resting blood glucose across the lifespan,
236.61 what you find is as people age,
238.087 resting blood glucose goes up.
240.85 Now, this is very interesting,
242.11 because for a long time it was thought
244.33 that metabolism actually
goes down as we age.
246.95 And to some extent, that's true,
248.423 but the reductions in metabolism
250.64 are not nearly as robust
as we once thought
253.0 that they were across the lifespan.
255.08 However, unless there's something done
257.604 to mitigate the increase
in blood glucose associated
260.73 with the aging,
261.87 almost everybody experiences a gradual,
264.309 but regular increase in
resting blood glucose
268.28 that predicts mortality.
270.37 Now, the title, as I mentioned,
271.73 is "Fasting Blood Glucose
as a Predictor of Mortality:
274.72 Lost in Translation".
275.767 And the reason that they
included "Lost in Translation"
278.63 in the title is that what I just told you,
280.768 that increases in resting blood
283.18 glucose predict mortality, or
are correlated with mortality,
286.3 is true for human beings
287.858 and for non-human primates, monkeys.
290.607 But the opposite is true in mice.
293.163 And so I thought it was important
294.97 to use this study as an example
297.122 of where it studies in mice often,
299.647 but not always, translate to humans
302.249 and to non-human primates.
304.23 So today, I'm going to be careful
305.5 to distinguish when a study
307.15 was performed in mice versus in humans,
309.01 because it seems that at
least when discussing feeding,
313.424 blood glucose and other aspects of diet
315.606 as they relate to health and wellbeing,
317.659 whether or not a study
was performed in rodents
320.34 or in humans can be very important.
323.96 In this case,
324.8 the results were directly
180 degrees opposite
327.335 to one another.
329.11 In other words, in mice,
330.27 resting blood glucose went down,
332.148 and was associated with mortality.
334.6 So lower blood glucose
associated with mortality.
336.63 Whereas in humans,
337.463 higher resting blood glucose
was associated with mortality.
340.25 And obviously,
341.12 what we're mostly interested in is health
343.389 and wellbeing of ourselves, of humans.
346.2 I'm sure there are some people
out there that are intensely
348.69 concerned about the health
and wellbeing of mice,
350.62 which you could imagine
352.156 a few rare contexts
where that's important,
354.61 but obviously most of us are
interested in human health.
357.22 So I'll be sure to emphasize
when studies were performed
360.13 in humans versus in mice.
362.21 Before we begin,
363.22 I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
364.592 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
367.355 It is, however,
368.68 part of my desire and
effort to bring zero cost
370.94 to consumer information
371.93 about science and science-related tools
374.03 to the general public.
375.66 In keeping with that theme,
376.7 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
379.52 Our first sponsor is ROKA.
380.893 ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
383.237 that are the absolute highest quality.
385.687 I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system
388.58 and how we see, and ROKA,
391.206 which is a company developed
392.85 by two all-American swimmers
394.05 from Stanford has developed eyeglasses
396.08 and sunglasses that take into
account the science of vision,
398.955 and they've produced an
absolutely terrific product.
401.698 That product involves glasses
403.284 that, first of all, are very lightweight.
406.257 Second of all, can be worn
when performing any activity.
409.811 They really are performance
eyeglasses and sunglasses.
412.83 So whether or not you're sweating
413.92 or running around,
414.88 whether or not you're working,
whether or not you're hiking,
417.49 cycling, et cetera,
418.51 you can wear them for
essentially any activity.
420.4 The nice thing is they also
have a great aesthetic.
422.75 So unlike a lot of other performance
423.999 sunglasses and eyeglasses out there
425.927 that can make people
427.3 look more or less like
cyborgs, ROKA eyeglasses
429.81 and sunglasses look great,
431.24 whether or not you're wearing
them to dinner or at work,
433.05 or whether or not you're headed out
434.01 for a run or a cycle or
something of that sort.
436.602 As I mentioned before,
they're extremely lightweight.
438.76 They don't slip off.
439.671 And that's true,
441.34 regardless of what activity
you're engaging in.
442.968 If you'd like to try ROKA
glasses, you can go to ROKA.com,

451.888 Today's podcast is also brought
453.64 to us by InsideTracker.
454.941 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
457.93 that analyzes data from your blood
459.5 and DNA to help you better
460.89 understand your body and help
you meet your health goals.
463.78 I've long been a believer
464.91 in getting regular blood work done,
466.65 for the simple reason
that many of the processes
468.98 that are occurring in your body
470.07 that impact your immediate and
471.93 long-term health can only be assessed
473.796 from a quality blood test.
475.49 And nowadays, with the
advent of modern DNA tests,
477.654 you can also assess your genome
479.284 and how that's impacting your immediate
481.34 and long-term health.
482.286 The problem with a lot
of blood and DNA tests
484.9 is you get information back,
485.963 but you don't know what to
do with that information.
488.27 And InsideTracker has solved that problem.
490.56 They have a very easy to use dashboard
491.953 so that when you get your results back,
493.703 it will tell you, for instance,
495.81 if your levels of a
particular metabolic factor
497.754 or hormone are too high or too low,
499.79 what you can do, what you can take,
501.91 how you can change your nutrition
503.11 in order to adjust those levels
504.59 and get them where you want them to be.
506.21 This is tremendously useful
508.05 and takes all the guesswork out
509.33 of what to do with biomarker information.

521.98 Today's episode is brought
to us by Helix Sleep.
524.067 Helix Sleep makes mattresses
526.15 and pillows that are tailored
527.52 to your unique sleep needs,
529.1 and in doing so, provide
the best sleep possible.
531.782 I started sleeping on a Helix mattress
533.658 about a year or so ago,
534.988 and it is the best sleep
that I've ever had.
537.381 If you go to the Helix site,
538.804 you take a brief two minute quiz,
540.963 and that quiz asks you questions such as,
543.227 do you tend to sleep on your stomach,
545.14 your side, or your back?
546.21 Do you tend to run hot
or cold during the night?
548.14 Maybe you don't know,
549.07 and they match you to
a particular mattress
550.92 that's ideal for your sleep needs.
552.41 In my case, I matched to
the so-called Dusk mattress.
554.838 I've been sleeping on a Dusk
mattress, and as I mentioned,
557.75 it's absolutely terrific.
559.176 Best sleep I've ever had.
560.688 It's really key to get a mattress
that's best suited to you.
564.409 If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,
566.5 you can go to HelixSleep.com,
take that two minute quiz,
569.37 and they'll match you to a
customized mattress for you.
571.467 And you'll get up to $200 off
any of your mattress orders,
575.69 and you'll get two free pillows.
576.972 If you're interested in Helix Sleep,
578.64 you can go to HelixSleep.com/huberman,
580.716 and you get up to $200 off your mattress,
582.862 and two free pillows.
584.53 I'd like to point you
toward a valuable resource
586.529 that's also zero cost and
is available now online.
591.065 This is an event that was recorded.
593.784 The event was held by Logitech,
595.978 and I was fortunate enough
to partake in this event.
598.466 And the entire event
was centered around how
600.695 to be a more effective learner
602.433 and teacher using the modern
principles of neuroplasticity.
606.777 So at the link in the
caption for this episode,
610.325 you can go to what was called
the Rethink Education Event.
614.41 And there, I gave a seminar
of about 20 or 30 minutes
617.645 describing the modern
neuroscience of neuroplasticity,
621.98 the nervous system's ability
623.18 to change in response to experience.
624.988 I focused mainly on human studies
627.29 and how different structures
and different things,
631.627 and tools that one can
633.0 implement in the classroom and outside
634.73 of the classroom can lead to
faster and more pervasive,
638.65 longer lasting learning of
motor skills, music skills,
641.93 mathematical skills,
language skills, et cetera,
644.556 all based on quality
peer reviewed research.
646.963 So if you'd like to check that out,
648.908 you can head to that link.
650.31 You'll also see an example of
some of those tools in action,
653.149 in a music classroom of a
phenomenal music teacher,
657.039 Ben Edie, who's a teacher out in Pasadena,
660.625 who has applied these tools,
662.26 at least to my knowledge,
for the first time ever.
664.222 Of course, all the tools
665.681 that are there are listed out
666.83 in what I call a
plasticity super protocol,
669.895 and all those tools can be applied
672.77 to learning and teaching in
any format that you like.
675.79 So check it out.
676.73 It's in the caption to
this week's episode,
678.451 and it will remain there,
680.49 it's up on YouTube and
I hope you enjoy it.
682.482 Okay, so let's talk
about feeding, fasting,
685.222 health and performance.
687.434 And I want to just establish
a few foundational terms
691.362 so that we're all on the same page.
693.721 First of all,
694.8 rather than talk about fasting
or time restricted feeding,
697.756 I'm largely going to talk
about time restricted feeding,
701.08 but please understand that
time restricted feeding
703.342 is just one side of the coin
705.626 that is a two-sided coin
708.12 that includes fasting on the one hand,
709.96 not eating, and time restricted
feeding on the other hand,
713.14 I may occasionally say fasting,
715.18 but because fasting and
eating establish different
718.278 biological conditions in the body,
720.96 time-restricted feeding
722.06 is the term that I will use to describe
724.606 the overall plan of
restricting one's eating window
728.789 as it's called to a particular
phase of each 24 hour day,
733.85 or in some cases two particular
days within the week.
738.36 Because as you'll soon learn,
739.573 there are aspects of
time restricted feeding,
741.947 aka fasting, that involve
eating every other day,
745.817 or eating one way for five days
748.88 and then fasting for
two days, and so forth.
751.21 So I'll be very precise about
what I mean and why I mean it.
754.396 But for the time being,
756.45 I'm going to refer to
time restricted feeding
759.54 as a way to put an umbrella
over this conversation.
763.433 Second of all,
764.437 I am going to emphasize a
lot of biological mechanism.
767.848 If you've listened to this podcast before,
769.703 you know that I always begin
with biological mechanism.
773.59 I do describe tools of how to
implement those mechanisms,
776.936 but I wholeheartedly believe
that knowing mechanisms
781.05 and understanding how these processes work
783.138 gives you tremendous
785.3 flexibility and understanding,
787.172 and control over the processes
789.671 of your mental and physical health.
791.53 Whereas if I were to just list off a menu
793.862 of things to do and not
to do, those will work,
797.952 but those will not give you the kind
800.9 of understanding that would allow you
802.96 to navigate through life, through travel,
805.59 through dinners out, through
different exercise schedules,
808.935 whether or not you're one age
or another age, male, female,
812.21 et cetera, I'm giving you mechanisms
814.402 so that you can gain more
control over the systems
817.078 in your brain and body.
818.775 Everything's timestamped,
820.39 so if you want to jump to the to do's,
822.03 you can certainly do that,
823.27 but I encourage you to hang in
there for the mechanism bit.
826.74 I will make it all very clear
827.844 because if you understand mechanism,
829.718 you are in a true place
of power and control
831.985 over your biology.
833.332 If ever there was a topic
that is controversial,
836.73 especially on the internet,
838.05 it is that of diet and nutrition.
840.76 So I'm wading into this
with a smile and in eager
843.769 anticipation of all the but but but this
847.43 and but but but that, and wait,
848.742 but this showed that.
850.376 Here's the deal,
851.96 we need to precisely define
854.3 what it is that we're talking about
855.79 when we talk about nutrition.
857.45 I'm going to give you an example
859.32 of a study that was
published a few years ago,
861.76 2018, by a colleague of mine at Stanford,
864.58 Chris Gardner, he's a terrific professor
868.94 of nutrition and has done a lot
870.826 of important studies on
how nutrition impacts
873.843 different aspects of health.
875.863 This is a large-scale study.
878.02 It was published in JAMA,
879.66 the Journal of the American
Medical Association,
881.65 one of the very top tier
journals in the area of medicine,
885.69 and certainly for a paper on nutrition
887.68 to show up there meant that it had
889.17 to meet an exceedingly high standard.
891.821 This paper, where Chris
is the first author,
896.26 it's Gardner et al, 2018 JAMA,
898.872 looked at weight loss
in people following one
903.643 particular diet versus
another particular diet.
906.703 And this was a 12 month weight loss study.
909.55 So it was focused
specifically on weight loss,
911.777 although they looked at some
other parameters as well.
914.61 And the basic conclusion of the study was
916.329 that there was no significant difference
919.45 in weight change between
people following a healthy,
922.41 low fat diet versus a healthy,
924.042 low carbohydrate diet with significantly
926.011 more dietary fats in them.
928.459 This caused a lot of ripples
931.217 in the world of nutrition
and nutritional science,
935.06 and certainly in the general population,
936.957 because anyone that understands diet
940.11 and nutrition would
immediately say, but wait,
942.97 there are all sorts of
different implications of eating
945.268 one type of diet, say low
carbohydrate, higher fats,
948.637 versus a higher
carbohydrate, lower fat diet.
951.545 And indeed there are.
953.148 This study was focused specifically
955.202 on fat loss and on weight loss.
958.607 So as we discuss time restricted feeding,
963.4 we need to be very precise
964.254 about what are the effects
of time restricted feeding,
967.69 and of eating in particular ways
969.82 at particular times, we are
going to emphasize again,
973.18 whether or not the study was
done in mice or in humans,
975.94 in athletes, in men, in women, or both,
978.5 but the study from Gardner and colleagues
980.357 is a beautiful study,
981.715 and really emphasizes that
983.337 if one's main goal is
simply to lose weight,
986.863 then it really does not
matter what one eats provided
991.601 that the number of calories burned
994.653 is higher than the number
of calories ingested.
998.18 However, anyone out there who understands
1001.93 a little bit of biology,
1003.655 or a lot of biology will agree
1006.0 that there are many factors
1007.272 that impact that calories
burned part of the equation.
1010.687 Some of those are obvious.
1012.4 So for instance,
1013.337 amount of exercise, type of
exercise, basal metabolic rate,
1017.91 how much energy one
burns just sitting there.
1020.039 I've talked before on this podcast
1021.398 about NEIT, Non Exercise
Induced Thermogenesis,
1024.8 where if people bounce around
a lot and fidget a lot,
1026.969 they can burn anywhere from
800 to 2,000 calories per day.
1031.06 So their quote-unquote
basal metabolic rate
1033.142 is actually much higher simply
1034.68 because they're fidgeters,
1035.62 whereas people who tend
to be more stationary
1037.36 have a lower basal
metabolic rate, on average.
1039.85 There's a great science to support this.
1042.249 Metabolic factors and hormones
1045.03 are also very important.
1046.75 Hormones, such as thyroid hormone
1048.746 and insulin and growth hormone,
1051.37 and the sex story to hormones,
testosterone and estrogen,
1053.577 those levels will also
profoundly influence
1056.197 the calories out, the
calories burned component
1059.341 of the calories in, calories out equation.
1062.161 So if out there on the internet
1065.45 or in listening to a particular podcast
1067.199 or speaker, somebody says,
1068.817 this is the ideal diet,
1070.527 or calories in, calories out does not
1073.31 matter, or calories in calories out
1074.85 is the only thing that matters.
1076.054 I think it's very important to understand
1078.13 that there are some foundational truths,
1080.01 such as calories in, calories out,
1081.99 but that of course,
1083.286 hormone factors and the context in which
1086.75 a given diet regimen is taking place
1089.226 are exceedingly important.
1091.21 A good example of this would be puberty
1094.16 at that time in life,
1096.18 sex steroid hormones
are changing profoundly
1098.22 in the body as our growth
hormone and other hormones.
1101.26 And much of caloric intake
1103.33 is directed towards protein synthesis,
1105.679 towards the production of muscle and bone
1107.9 and other tissues of the body.
1109.23 And that's because of changes in hormones
1111.14 that we call puberty.
1112.53 So, there's no way that we can drill
1115.2 into every aspect of a given feeding plan
1118.7 or feeding schedule that would allow us
1122.44 to tap into every aspect of the list
1124.36 that I read out before weight loss,
1126.72 fat loss, muscle organ, genome, epigenome,
1128.7 inflammation, exercise,
cognition, mood, and lifespan.
1130.802 But today, we're going to be very precise
1133.11 about how time restricted feeding,
1135.378 it's very clear from both animal studies
1138.5 and human studies
1139.382 can have a very powerful
and positive impact
1143.433 on everything from weight loss
1145.66 and fat loss to various health parameters.
1149.189 This is a beautiful literature
1151.04 that's emerged mostly in
the last 10 or 15 years.
1154.428 And as we march into this literature,
1156.71 what you'll see is that there actually
1158.166 is a perfect diet for you on a given day.
1162.602 And that perfect diet for you on
1164.684 a given day is contextual,
1167.85 meaning it depends on
what you did yesterday
1170.017 and what you're going to do tomorrow.
1172.96 So there is a perfect diet for you.
1174.556 And today, I'm going to arm you
1175.9 with the mechanisms and understanding
1178.17 that will allow you to define what
1179.62 that perfect diet is
1181.02 and will allow you to eat on a schedule
1183.728 and to eat the things that are going
1186.26 to best serve your goals.
1187.641 So let's talk about eating
and what happens when you eat,
1191.4 and let's talk about
fasting, or not eating,
1194.38 and what happens when you fast.
1196.059 I did an entire episode on eating
1198.596 and metabolism, and
hormones and other factors
1201.62 that impact appetite.
1203.198 We don't have time to go
into all those details now,
1205.67 although you're welcome to
listen to that episode as well,
1209.071 but we can briefly describe
the overall conditions
1213.044 that are set in the body when we eat
1215.369 and when we don't eat.
1217.825 The key word here is conditions.
1220.498 If I can emphasize anything
today, it's that what you eat
1224.434 and when you eat it set
conditions in your body,
1228.935 and those conditions can
be very good for you,
1231.76 or very bad for you,
depending on when you eat.
1235.195 In fact, when you eat is as
important as what you eat.
1241.349 I'll repeat that, when you eat
1243.25 is as important as what you eat,
1244.83 at least as it relates
to health parameters,
1247.1 in particular, liver
health and mental health.
1250.38 Some simple rules about eating.
1251.92 First of all, when you eat,
typically your blood glucose,
1256.55 your blood sugar, will go up.
1258.464 Also, insulin levels will go up.
1261.31 Insulin is a hormone that's involved
1263.01 in mobilizing glucose
from the bloodstream.
1265.954 How much your glucose and insulin go up
1269.67 depends on what you eat
and how much you eat.
1272.06 In general, simple sugars,
including fructose from fruit,
1277.89 but also sucrose and glucose,
1279.49 and simple sugars will raise your insulin
1282.45 and blood glucose more
than complex carbohydrates.
1286.32 Things like grains, and breads,
and pastas, and so forth,
1288.66 and grains, and breads, and
pastas, and so forth will raise
1291.62 your blood glucose more
than fibrous carbohydrates,
1294.026 like lettuce, and broccoli,
and things of that sort.
1297.643 Protein has a somewhat moderate
1300.63 or modest impact on insulin and glucose,
1303.2 and fat has the lowest impact
1305.031 on raising your blood
glucose and blood insulin.
1308.369 So what you eat will
impact how steep a rise
1312.64 in blood glucose and insulin takes place.
1315.48 And there are a number of factors
1317.3 that are related to your individual health
1319.24 that will also dictate how steep
1320.54 and how high that rise in
glucose and insulin will be.
1324.57 For the time being, I'm leaving
1325.437 out people who have type one diabetes.
1328.38 These are people that don't
manufacture their own insulin,
1331.02 and type two diabetes is
essentially insulin insensitivity,
1336.91 lack of sensitivity to insulin,
1338.56 which leads to high blood glucose.
1340.88 But, when you eat,
1342.171 blood glucose goes up
and when you don't eat,
1344.81 blood glucose and insulin go down.
1347.085 The longer it's been since your last meal,
1349.87 the lower, typically,
1350.773 your blood glucose and insulin will be.
1353.66 And the higher, things like
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide 1,
1360.053 glucagon being a hormone
that's also secreted
1363.78 when you are in a fasted state
or a low blood glucose state.
1369.3 It's involved in mobilizing
various energy sources
1373.21 from the body, including fat
through what we call lipolysis,
1376.562 also using carbohydrates,
1378.56 and potentially even using
muscle as a source of energy.
1381.28 So, that's kind of a fire hose
1385.25 of information about what happens
1387.17 when you eat and don't eat,
1388.13 but just think of it this way, blood sugar
1390.26 and insulin go up when you eat,
1391.628 they go down when you don't eat,
1393.35 and other hormones go
up when you don't eat.
1396.21 So there are hormones associated
with the fasted state,
1399.059 and there are hormones associated
1400.608 with the eating and
having just eaten state.
1404.656 Now, the most important thing
1407.09 to understand is that,
like everything in biology,
1411.192 this is a process that takes time.
1414.36 So insulin and glucose go up when we eat,
1417.237 and it takes some period of time
1418.82 for them to go down,
1420.02 even if we stop eating,
1421.431 they will remain up for
some period of time,
1424.15 and then go back down, it takes time.
1426.833 This is very important,
1428.65 because if you look at
the scientific literature
1431.14 on fasting, on time-restricted feeding,
1434.554 it's absolutely clear
that the health benefits,
1438.096 not just the weight loss benefits,
1440.43 but that the health benefits
1441.94 from time-restricted feeding,
1443.13 occur because certain conditions
1445.62 are met in the brain and body
for a certain amount of time.
1450.4 And that gives us an anchor
1452.062 from which to view what eating
1455.08 is in terms of how it sets
conditions in the body over time.
1459.64 And if that sounds overly
analytic, I promise you,
1462.94 this is the simplest
1464.11 and best way to think
about any eating schedule
1466.92 or any eating plan.
1468.53 So I think it's fair to say
that in the field of nutrition,
1471.172 there are a few landmark
studies that serve
1474.013 as really strong anchors for
building our understanding
1477.65 of what to eat and what not to eat
1479.717 and when to eat, depending on our goals.
1482.35 The Gardner study that I mentioned earlier
1484.36 is one such study,
1486.1 in that it says if your
goal is weight loss,
1489.114 it really does not matter
what foods you consume,
1493.49 provided that you consume a
sub-maintenance, caloric diet.
1497.92 However, I want to emphasize again,
1499.665 that sets aside issues of adherence,
1504.23 meaning how easy or hard it
is to adhere to a given diet.
1507.68 Some people find it much easier
1509.16 to follow a high fat,
low carbohydrate diet.
1511.24 Some people fall follow
1512.184 a different diet because it's much easier
1514.21 for them to follow.
1515.6 And some people are concerned
1516.93 with mental performance
and athletic performance.
1519.01 So that study doesn't
say there's a best diet,
1521.693 what it says is that what you consume
1523.866 is less important than the
amount of food that you consume,
1528.64 at least for sake of weight loss,
1531.0 not necessarily for sake of health.
1533.67 Now, the study that I'm going
1535.56 to refer to next is what I would consider
1538.21 the second major pillar
of nutritional studies.
1541.05 This is a truly landmark study
1542.46 that was carried out by Satchin Panda,
1545.878 who is a professor at the Salk Institute
1548.7 of Biological Studies in San Diego,
1549.943 an absolutely phenomenal institution,
1552.91 and an absolutely phenomenal researcher.
1554.969 I've known Satchin for a number of years,
1556.97 and I want to emphasize
that the current literature
1560.168 on intermittent fasting
1562.19 and time restricted feeding can largely
1563.707 be attributed to Satchin
1566.196 and the work that he's done.
1568.21 There are others involved too, of course.
1570.585 And of course, time-restricted feeding
1572.76 and fasting has a rich history
that goes back many hundreds,
1575.787 if not thousands of years
in different cultures
1577.821 and religions,
1579.35 but the science of time-restricted
feeding can really mainly
1582.69 be attributed to the incredible
work that Satchin has done.
1585.306 And I'm grateful to consider
him a friend and a colleague,
1589.6 and we consulted at length in
anticipation of this episode.
1592.55 I also hope to have him on
as a guest in the future.
1595.2 The landmark paper that
came from Satchin's lab
1597.81 was published in 2012.
1599.163 This was a paper in
mice that set the basis
1602.027 for studies in humans that came later.
1605.01 And the title of this paper
is time-restricted feeding
1608.01 without reducing caloric intake,
1610.42 prevents metabolic diseases
in mice fed a high fat diet.
1614.062 So the title tells us a lot.
1616.52 It says that what's varied in this study
1619.35 is not what these mice ate,
it was when they ate it.
1622.723 And there were essentially four conditions
1625.9 in this study and the results
are absolutely remarkable.
1629.093 So I'm going to walk you
through the major results.
1631.824 What they did is they gave mice access
1635.221 to different types of food.
1636.955 There were four groups,
1638.87 one group of mice had access
to just a normal mouse diet.
1643.49 It would not be a diet that
you'd be very interested in.
1645.284 I confess I've actually tasted mouse chow.
1647.334 If you work with mice at
all, you just have to do it.
1649.69 At least once it doesn't taste very good,
1651.51 it tastes like a very bland
Graham cracker cookie.
1653.66 And I confessed that. I only
had the tiniest little bit,
1655.28 but mice like that stuff.
1656.541 And if you allow them to eat that stuff,
1659.4 what's called ad libitum
whenever they want,
1661.58 you just keep it in their
food. 24 hours a day,
1664.02 they will eat sometimes,
1665.24 and then they won't eat it at
other times, or in this case,
1668.87 they also had a condition where
they gave them mouse chow in
1671.67 a time restricted way,
1672.88 just for a certain
number of hours each day,
1675.831 but about eight hours, or they
gave them a high-fat diet.
1681.41 That was a separate group,
1682.32 got a high-fat diet at
any time they wanted.
1684.85 So this was kind of the
carnival for mice because mice
1686.734 really like high fat,
highly palatable foods.
1689.69 And so they got a lot of
goodies and high-fat in their
1691.949 food.
1692.95 And then there was a fourth
group that had access to the
1695.53 high fat diet as much
as they wanted to eat,
1697.95 but only during a restricted
time period of each 24 hour
1701.87 cycle, now mice are nocturnal.
1703.57 Humans are what we call diurnal, actually,
1705.423 we're not really diurnal
we're crepuscular,
1708.37 which means that we're most
active in the morning and in the
1710.87 evening, not so much in the
afternoon, but nonetheless,
1714.322 everything I'm going to tell
you is true also for humans.
1719.21 And we know this now from human studies,
1720.624 one of the most important
things to take away from this
1722.783 study was that mice that ate
a highly palatable high-fat
1726.688 diet, a great tasting diet,
1728.64 but only during a restricted
feeding window of each 24 hour
1731.11 cycle maintained or lost
weight over time, whereas mice
1736.95 that ingested the same diet,
same amount of calories,
1741.116 but had access to those
calories around the clock,
1744.644 gained weight, became
obese and quite sick.
1748.67 And as an additional second point,
1750.312 the mice that restricted
their feeding window to a
1754.15 particular portion of eight
hours of every 24 hour cycle
1757.686 actually showed some
improvement in important health
1762.19 markers.
1763.42 And what was even more incredible
is that mice that only ate
1767.64 during a particular feeding window,
1769.264 also experienced some reversal
of some prior negative health
1774.54 effects.
1775.6 So this study really lit up the
world and got people excited
1778.61 about time-restricted eating again.
1781.557 They use an eight hour feeding window.
1785.959 The story around that eight
hour feeding window is kind of
1788.71 interesting though.
1790.703 Not many people know this
because it wasn't included in the
1792.62 paper, and there was no reason
to include it in the paper,
1796.322 not to out anybody,
1798.02 but it turns out that the
reason they used an eight hour
1800.71 feeding window and not a nine
hour or a 10 hour feeding
1803.81 window,
1804.643 is because studies of this sort
are actually quite demanding
1808.98 to perform and require the
constant presence of the graduate
1812.95 student,
1813.783 or post-doc there to ensure
that the food is in the cages at
1816.541 particular times and not in
the cages at other times.
1820.29 And mice are really good at hiding food.
1822.13 They'll even hide food in their jowls.
1824.51 And so there's a lot of work
that has to be done to prepare
1827.93 for that eight hour feeding window.
1829.65 And to make sure after that
eight hour feeding window,
1831.962 there's all the food has been
removed from the cage and from
1835.33 the jowls of the mice and so forth.
1837.12 And it turns out that the
significant other of the graduate
1840.54 student and or postdoc,
1842.45 I won't reveal who they were running.
1844.17 This study forbid their significant other,
1847.88 the scientist from being in
the lab for periods of time,
1852.1 that were much longer than
the 10 or 12 hours that were
1854.55 required in order to ensure
this eight hour feeding window.
1857.772 So when we hear the eight
hour feeding windows are holy,
1861.16 they are not holy and later,
1862.547 we are going to talk about
how eating for a time that's
1866.73 restricted to eight hours
versus 10 hours versus 12 hours.
1869.524 For instance,
1870.554 how that impacts various
parameters like health parameters
1873.204 and weight loss, et cetera.
1875.34 But the eight hour feeding
window was actually created
1877.465 because of a real world
constraint on the research and the
1880.48 relationship with the researcher
performing the research,
1882.507 not because there's anything
holy about an eight hour
1885.217 feeding window, now
1886.67 an important point about
when the feeding window falls
1889.532 within the 24 hour cycle,
1891.328 it is very important that the
feeding window fall during the
1895.322 more active phase of
one's day, so for humans,
1899.369 that's typically in the early
part of the day or the later
1903.55 part of the day,
1904.383 but not at night, put very simply,
1906.403 there are a lot of data now
1908.151 pointing to the fact that eating
during the nocturnal phase
1912.587 of the 24 hour cycle is very
detrimental to one's health.
1917.555 In fact,
1918.685 when we eat can either enhance
our health or can diminish
1922.92 our health.
1924.234 When we see light can enhance
our feelings of wellbeing or
1928.135 can diminish our feelings of wellbeing.
1930.59 I've talked many times before about this,
1932.2 on the human lab podcast,
that during the daytime,
1934.021 you want to get as much sunlight
and other types of bright
1937.37 light in your eyes as safely possible.
1938.716 And then you want to avoid light
in the middle of the night.
1942.029 It has detrimental dopamine
lowering effects can cause
1944.946 depression, cortisol increases, et cetera.
1947.88 So when you view light is as
important as the light that you
1950.576 view.
1952.11 And when you eat is as important
as what you eat, in this
1956.325 study, they saw something
really interesting,
1960.107 which was that not only did
restricting food to a particular
1964.5 phase of the 24 hour cycle benefit,
1966.174 things like lean body mass
and fat loss and a number of
1971.59 health parameters that we'll
talk about in a moment,
1973.88 but it also anchored all the
gene systems of the body and
1977.127 provided a more regular stable
so-called circadian rhythm or
1981.89 24 hour rhythm, you may be
surprised to learn that 80%,
1985.671 80% of the genes in your
body and brain are on a 24
1992.006 hour schedule.
1993.87 That is they change their levels
going from high to low and
1996.809 back to high again,
across the 24 hour cycle.
1999.94 And when those genes are high
at the appropriate times and
2002.9 low at the appropriate times,
2004.25 meaning their expression is
high and low at the appropriate
2007.22 times.
2008.12 And therefore the proper RNAs
and proteins are made because
2011.56 DNA codes for RNA, RNA is
translated into proteins.
2016.66 When that happens, your health benefits,
2019.42 when those genes are not
expressed at the right times when
2022.756 they're higher or low at the
wrong times of each 24 hour
2026.24 cycle, that's when you get
negative health effects.
2028.818 This study showed that when
mice restrict their eating to an
2032.61 eight hour period within the
most active phase of their 24
2036.75 hour cycle,
2038.002 many of the genes that are
associated with these so-called
2041.1 circadian clocks, these genes
have names like PER, BMAL,
2044.255 CRY1, et cetera,
2046.67 those so-called clock genes
underwent a very regular
2050.493 entrainment, a locking in to
the proper 24 hour schedule.
2055.27 And while this was in mice,
2056.264 we now know that this
also occurs in humans,
2059.17 I've said before on this
podcast, and I'll say it again,
2061.878 that light,
2063.02 and when we view light is the
primary way in which these
2065.85 genes and the clock systems
of our body get organized or
2069.09 entrained, meaning matched to
the outside light dark cycle.
2072.32 So viewing light early in
the day and in the afternoon,
2074.78 and as much as possible all day, great,
2076.58 ideally that sunlight, avoiding
light in the middle of the
2079.41 night is also great.
2081.357 It's great because it causes
the increases in particular
2086.18 genes and the decreases in
particular genes in every cell
2088.62 throughout your body at
the appropriate times,
2090.394 the second most powerful
timekeeper or zeitgeber, as it's
2094.71 called, is food, and when
you eat, and in this study,
2100.221 the results they saw
underscore this point,
2103.21 what they saw is that the peaks
in these clock genes became
2106.239 very regular.
2107.83 And the dips in these clock
genes became very regular.
2110.61 And that led to a whole
host of really important,
2113.867 positive health effects.
2116.099 Conversely, when mice ate,
2118.387 whenever they wanted
across the 24 hour cycle,
2120.669 these clock genes became
really out of whack and the
2123.929 negative health consequences
were the downstream result of
2128.367 these changes in these clock genes.
2131.787 This is now also been shown
to be true for humans.
2135.14 So if you want to be healthy,
you want your organ health,
2138.13 your metabolic health to
be in trained properly.
2141.846 One of the most important
things you can do is to,
2143.47 if you lied at the appropriate
times of each 24 hour
2146.05 schedule and to not view
light at other times of that
2148.38 schedule and to eat at the
appropriate time of each 24 hour
2152.04 day.
2153.76 Now, again,
2154.593 there are rare instances that
we will discuss when skipping
2157.079 entire days or entire 24
hour cycles of eating can be
2160.595 beneficial.
2161.99 But for now we're talking
about schedules of time
2164.83 restricted
2165.663 feeding involve a window of
feeding that falls during
2168.55 your more active phase,
so during the daytime,
2170.79 putting aside people that work
shift work during the daytime
2173.923 is when you want to eat.
2175.503 And this eight hour feeding
window provided a very strong
2179.593 reinforcing signal that combines
with light to ensure that
2184.25 these genes are expressed
at the appropriate times.
2186.555 The short takeaway from this
is you probably want to think
2189.883 about and perhaps even engage
in time, restricted feeding.
2194.29 So, as I mentioned earlier,
2195.35 when mice can eat around the
clock, bad things happen.
2198.42 And one of the bad things
that happens is that the liver
2201.27 suffers, the liver is involved
in all sorts of things,
2205.3 production of important hormones
and other factors related
2207.283 to metabolism.
2209.01 And when mice can eat around the clock,
2211.442 their livers got very sick,
fatty deposits in the liver.
2214.553 Other factors in the liver
essentially taken down the
2218.05 pathway of liver disease,
the time restricted feeding,
2221.341 essentially reversed that or
led in many cases to an even
2224.815 healthier liver conditions,
and that's based on this study,
2227.262 but also additional
studies also now in humans.
2230.531 So restricting your feeding
to a particular window,
2234.24 every 24 hour cycle has clearly
been shown now in mice and
2237.71 in humans to enhance liver
health, which is wonderful.
2242.234 How does it do this, well, it
happens because food intake,
2247.58 as I mentioned earlier,
2248.52 sets certain conditions in the
body that lasts for a period
2251.66 of time.
2252.8 Anytime we eat,
2253.93 whether or not we are a
mouse or a human, there's
2255.671 a period of time that's required
for so-called digestion,
2259.86 but also gastric emptying and
other processes related to
2263.052 breaking down that food and utilizing it.
2265.7 And that is an active
process. It requires energy.
2268.759 And that process of breaking
down food involves certain
2274.69 cellular functions that if
they're ongoing throughout the 24
2279.02 hour cycle or even extended
too far across the 24 hour
2282.743 cycle, meaning you're eating
across a 14 or a 16 hour,
2286.329 an 18 hour window, that
causes serious problems.
2290.18 And this is now been established
because of the fact that it
2293.773 increases the expression of
different proteins and genes in
2298.1 the body, as such as
TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-1.
2301.07 what are all those things?
2302.3 They are pro-inflammatory markers.
2304.54 So the reason that the liver
gets sick when you're eating
2306.836 too often is because inflammatory
markers are increased.
2310.67 These inflammatory markers
are not inherently bad,
2314.17 they're there for a reason,
2315.171 but they are there in
order to respond to certain
2318.47 challenges, immune challenges,
2320.208 or the ingestion of food
and the breakdown of food.
2322.93 But then in an ideal circumstance,
2325.93 they are reduced in the period
in which there's no food
2329.418 present in the digestive
tract or in which there's very
2332.11 little food present in
the digestive tract.
2334.43 So by eating around the clock,
2335.595 you're making yourself sicker
by eating at restricted
2339.07 periods of time, each 24 hours a day,
2341.09 you're actually making
yourself healthier and you're
2343.87 activating certain processes
that can positively impact both
2348.174 weight, either maintenance
or loss of weight.
2351.75 We'll talk about weight gain
a little later and positively
2354.59 impacting things like liver health.
2356.06 Also the expression of different
things related to brown
2358.755 fat, the fat that
increases your metabolism.
2361.81 We will return to this also
a little bit later and blood
2364.843 glucose regulation, so the
takeaway from this study,
2369.126 in fact, there are many
takeaways from the study.
2371.15 It's so wonderful is that liver health,
2374.844 bile acid metabolism, energy
expenditure inflammation,
2379.566 liver metabolites, many,
2383.0 many aspects of our health
are impacted by when we eat,
2386.66 not just what we eat, as we move forward,
2389.23 and we talk about intermittent
fasting for eight hour
2391.779 windows, six hour windows,
2393.49 12 hour windows for all sorts
of different intents and
2396.69 purposes.
2397.72 I want to start to establish
a foundational protocol that
2401.153 all of us,
2402.56 any of us can use in order
to maximize your particular
2405.463 goals.
2407.061 There are some absolutes
within this realm of
2410.48 time-restricted feeding.
2412.475 Here are a couple of absolutes
that you would want to
2415.07 consider, first of all,
2418.29 it pays off in the metabolic
sense and in the health sense
2422.017 and in the weight maintenance
or loss sense to not ingest
2427.081 any food in the first hour
after waking and potentially for
2432.44 longer, so I want to repeat that.
2433.93 One of the key pillars of
intermittent fasting is that for
2436.717 the first hour
2438.17 after you wake up and potentially
for longer to not ingest
2441.13 any food, okay,
2443.503 the second major pillar that's
well supported by research is
2447.12 that for the two and ideally
three hours prior to bedtime,
2452.385 you also don't ingest any food
or liquid calories for that
2457.24 matter.
2458.073 And we will talk about what
it means to break a fast and
2460.357 whether or not certain liquids,
2462.41 even coffee and tea can
break a fast, et cetera,
2464.73 in a few moments, but
just as a foundation,
2468.128 it's very clear from the research
in humans that not eating
2471.429 any food or ingesting any
calories liquid or otherwise for
2475.259 the first 60 minutes
after waking up each day.
2478.859 And for the two to three
hours prior to your bedtime,
2483.87 that's ideal for the
parameters that we've discussed
2487.22 earlier,
2488.053 all the different things like
weight and liver health and
2490.26 metabolic health and so forth.
2491.962 The two most common questions
about intermittent fasting are
2494.693 when is the ideal time
for the eating window?
2498.08 Is it early in the day,
2498.913 the middle of the day or later in the day?
2501.16 And how long should that eating window be?
2503.94 Should it be eight hours?
2504.866 We already heard why the
eight hour window was first
2507.76 established.
2508.75 It was because of these lab
conditions and the conditions of
2511.09 the particular relationship
of the graduate student
2513.25 involved,
2514.083 or should it be seven hours
or six hours or 12 hours.
2516.33 It turns out that there's some
general frameworks that we
2520.22 can follow in order to
answer these questions.
2522.377 As we move into this
portion of the discussion,
2524.516 I want to highlight a very
important reference that just
2527.759 came out,
2529.35 literally came out last week
in the journal endocrinology
2532.93 reviews.
2534.06 And the title of this review
is time-restricted eating for
2537.12 the prevention and management
of metabolic diseases.
2539.762 Although the data in this
paper go well beyond metabolic
2544.61 diseases, this is a paper
from Satchin Panda's lab.
2547.89 It's a very lengthy review
with an enormous table
2551.57 that's beautifully organized
that scripts out all the
2555.52 studies done in humans.
2557.126 Well over a hundred
studies looking at time,
2560.26 restricted feeding in
athletes, men, women, children,
2562.818 diabetes, no diabetes, et cetera,
2565.067 with detailed references and
description of the outcomes.
2568.302 I've spent a lot of time with this review,
2570.46 even though it just came out
recently and is a absolute
2572.895 goldmine resource.
2574.547 It is also the major resource
for everything I'm about to
2577.49 tell you if you would like
to delve deeper into the
2579.176 material.
2580.182 So let's deal with this first
question of when is the ideal
2584.29 feeding window, and here again,
2586.23 we're thinking about a schedule
of eating that involves
2589.56 eating at least once every 24 hours,
2591.777 not two day or three day
or every other day fast.
2595.534 So it turns out that the
answer to the question,
2598.64 when is it best to eat is
actually best answered by thinking
2602.197 about the other side of the coin,
2604.3 which is when is it best to fast?
2606.797 So, because we are fasting during sleep,
2609.973 it's very clear that it's best
to extend the sleep-related
2614.73 fast either into the morning
or to start it in the evening.
2620.485 Now this might seem kind of obvious,
2622.58 but it's actually not so obvious.
2624.494 You could place that feeding
window early in the day,
2628.5 middle of the day or late in the day.
2630.09 Let's think about what happens
when we sleep, when we sleep,
2633.651 our body undergoes a number
of different processes in the
2637.37 brain and body in order to
recover the cells and tissues.
2641.049 Many of you have probably
heard of autophagic,
2643.17 which is essentially a cleaning
up a gobbling up of dead
2646.25 cells and cells that are injured or sick.
2649.54 And this is a natural process that occurs,
2651.143 and it occurs mainly during sleep.
2653.51 Although not only during sleep,
2656.779 fasting of any kind does tend
2659.388 to enhance autophagy.
2661.42 It is not the only way to
create autophagic conditions.
2665.83 Autophagic conditions can be
created simply by following a
2669.38 sub caloric diet.
2670.71 And there are other things
that one can do in order to
2672.919 trigger autophagy, but fasting
does trigger autophagy.
2676.84 So when we're asleep,
2678.29 the bad cells are getting
gobbled up and eaten.
2680.399 And the good cells also are
undergoing certain repair
2684.59 mechanisms mainly related to,
2686.46 or at least governed by those
circadian genes that we talked
2689.33 about earlier, those clock genes.
2690.818 So you're already fasting when
you're asleep and how deep
2695.769 you are into that fast depends
on how long it was since your
2698.516 last meal.
2700.382 So if you fast early in the day,
2703.622 and you've been asleep
for 5, 6, 7, 8 hours,
2708.42 I would hope somewhere between
six and eight hours for most
2710.73 people is going to be beneficial.
2712.181 When you wake up,
2714.217 I mentioned earlier that you
don't want to eat for at least
2717.27 the first 60 minutes after waking,
2719.24 but were you to extend
that fasting to say,
2721.724 9:00 AM 10:00 AM,
2723.98 11:00 AM or even 12 noon or
later you are taking advantage
2728.128 of the deep, fast that
you were in during sleep.
2731.95 And certainly toward
the end of sleep, now,
2733.72 why do I say deep, fast?
2734.96 Well,
2736.619 because when we eat the clearance
of that food from our gut
2740.157 and the processes in our cells
and organs that are related
2744.38 to digestion,
2746.34 and the utilization of that
food takes about five to six
2750.53 hours, so if you eat a meal
and that meal lasts 10 minutes,
2755.72 20 minutes or 30 minutes, or even an hour,
2757.629 and then you stop eating,
you've stopped eating,
2760.54 but you are not fasting at that point.
2763.24 You can say you're fasting
because you're no longer putting
2765.22 food into your digestive tract,
2766.862 but you're not in a fasted state.
2769.51 You are not under conditions
of fasting, later,
2772.77 I'll talk about things that
you can do to accelerate the
2774.68 transition into fasting.
2775.864 So one thing is certain, that
you want your eating window to
2779.809 be tacked or attached to your
sleep based fasting in a way
2785.745 that makes it easier for you
to get into the fasted state
2789.462 for a period of time.
2791.33 So we can view that point
from the perspective of best,
2796.138 better and worst, okay?
2798.944 So if you are like most
people and you sleep at night,
2802.059 you're waking up somewhere
around 6:30, 7:00 AM,
2804.268 or maybe even 8:00 AM.
2805.95 Let's say you were to push
your fasting window out,
2808.405 such that you started eating at noon,
2812.87 and then you stopped eating at 6:00 PM.
2816.716 Well,
2817.98 then you're not eating from
6:00 PM until let's say your
2821.82 bedtime is 10:00 PM, but
from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM,
2824.63 your body is not yet in a fasted
state because you just ate.
2827.792 However,
2829.872 you're starting to taper into
a fastest state before sleep
2832.873 and then all through sleep.
2835.04 And until the next
morning and late morning,
2836.878 you are actually in a fasted state, now,
2840.3 most people find it very hard
to only eat in the middle of
2842.243 the day, so while that's best,
2845.081 it's ideal for sake of the fasting
2847.7 related improvements in health,
2849.484 it is not ideal.
2851.06 And it's not very applicable
to most work and family and
2855.44 social situations.
2856.481 Most people eat breakfast with others and,
2859.68 or eat dinner with others.
2861.147 Some people eat lunch with
others, but in general,
2864.337 it's hard to restrict your
feeding window to just the
2866.586 absolute middle of the day,
2868.38 but from a purely health perspective,
2870.53 in a very objective way, that
would be the ideal situation.
2873.463 Let's imagine a different
pattern of eating where the
2876.84 feeding window starts in the
afternoon starts around two or
2880.84 even 3:00 PM.
2882.12 Some people don't have much
trouble or they can train
2884.2 themselves to get their
feeding window out to two or
2887.138 3:00 PM, and then they won't
eat until 10 or 11:00 PM.
2891.32 Right, if you do the math,
2892.29 you realize that that feeding
window is still pretty short.
2894.72 It still constitutes what we
would call intermittent fasting
2897.6 or time restricted feeding.
2898.708 But assuming that they go
to bed around 11:00 PM or
2902.22 midnight,
2903.73 they are not actually fasted
in sleep because for the first
2907.759 six hours or so of sleep, maybe five,
2910.96 but probably more like six hours of sleep,
2912.44 they're still digesting the
food that they consumed a late
2914.724 in the night.
2916.163 It does appear beneficial
to grab a hold of that
2921.681 sleep-related fast,
2924.02 meaning you don't want your
feeding window to be too close
2928.26 to bedtime.
2929.093 And that's why we came up
with this kind of foundational
2931.48 pillar that I discussed
with such an earlier,
2933.91 which is at least no eating for
the first hour after waking,
2936.666 but also no eating within two
to three hours prior to bed.
2941.71 And because we all need to
sleep and sleep is seemingly
2943.616 important for our health of all kinds.
2946.627 You want to prioritize sleep,
2948.78 but because we also have to eat,
2950.133 then you start to think about
this and maybe it's not so
2953.34 good to push that feeding
window too late in the day,
2956.29 because when you go to sleep,
2957.81 you're not actually capitalizing
on the sleep related
2959.994 fasting.
2961.26 Now it's not just the case
that it's easiest to fast while
2964.31 in sleep, although that's true
because when we're asleep,
2966.58 typically we're not hungry or
looking for food or foraging
2969.49 for food or wanting food
or trying to resist food.
2971.367 We're just sleeping.
2973.305 There is something special
about the fasting that occurs
2976.73 during sleep,
2977.83 because it's associated with
a number of processes that
2980.453 relate to the so-called lymphatic system,
2983.45 the movement of lymph like
fluids and other fluids through
2986.94 the brain, and kind of sweeping
out a garbage disposal,
2990.11 if you will,
2990.943 a clearing out of the metabolic
debris and some of the
2993.67 autophagy that's associated
with bad processes in the brain.
2998.059 So we could do a whole episode on this,
3000.34 but essentially during
sleep, and in particular,
3002.41 during fasted states of sleep,
3004.471 we are undergoing a number
of automatic seller processes
3009.048 that clear out debris from
our brain enhance cognition,
3013.31 or at least offset dementia.
3014.72 This is now well-established
as well as a number of the same
3017.43 processes occurring in
the organs of our body.
3019.9 So what we're starting to
see here is that there are a
3022.63 number of constraints on
when you can eat, now,
3024.842 I would be remiss if I
didn't acknowledge the social
3028.04 constraints and the real
life constraints, some of us,
3030.198 because we want to eat with
our family and because our
3034.07 family or our significant
others eat around eight or
3036.59 9:00 PM, and that's the
only time we're together,
3038.36 You have to eat late in the day.
3040.61 And that certainly not a sin.
3041.93 I'm not saying that's good or bad, here
3043.407 we're trying to establish
if you recall, best, better,
3046.95 and worst.
3048.08 So from both a practical and
a health perspective and a
3052.34 purely objective view of how
intermittent fasting works and
3055.507 can benefit us, starting to eat each day,
3060.45 somewhere around 10:00 AM or around noon,
3064.515 and then allowing a feeding
window that goes until six or
3068.982 maybe 8:00 PM.
3071.034 That seems to me,
3073.156 at least based on the data
and what I understand about
3075.662 typical cultures,
3077.12 where people eat in the
daytime and in the evening,
3081.093 that seems to me like the kind
of schedule that will allow
3084.96 you to get the most out
of intermittent fasting,
3087.326 time-restricted feeding,
3089.432 but does not set you up to be
really out of sync with the
3093.32 social rhythms in most cultures.
3095.813 If you think about it from the
perspective of say a noon to
3099.67 eight feeding window,
3101.59 what you'll find is that
you're able to eat lunch with
3104.66 others.
3105.77 If you like, or by yourself,
3107.03 you will be able to eat
dinner at a reasonable hour,
3109.726 at least in most countries,
in most cultures,
3111.911 eating dinner somewhere
between 6:30 and 7:00 PM is
3116.788 typical.
3119.15 When you say a feeding
window, that goes until eight.
3121.37 That doesn't mean sitting
down to dinner at eight.
3123.97 That means your last bite of
food or ingestion of any liquid
3126.77 calories was at 8:00 PM.
3129.099 Assuming that you go to bed
somewhere between 10:00 PM and
3132.62 1:00 AM that allows this tapering off,
3134.95 or this transition from
feeding to a fasted state,
3138.44 and still allows you to capitalize
on the special period of
3142.09 fasting that is sleep-related fasting.
3144.92 And again,
3145.753 I want to emphasize that the
fasting that occurs during
3147.39 sleep is vital and eating too
close to sleep will disrupt
3150.227 that fasting related sleep.
3153.215 Now,
3154.048 there are a number of caveats
and details related to this,
3156.541 and there's an important caveat
in detail related to people
3160.699 that are specifically
interested in increasing or
3164.747 maintaining muscle mass.
3166.298 So first let's talk about food
volume and food type and how
3171.217 that relates to whether or not
you quickly or slowly enter a
3176.551 fasted state.
3178.23 Because clearly when we
talk about a feeding window,
3181.056 that feeding window could
include any number of different
3183.81 foods, it could involve
cake and ice cream, pizza,
3186.02 hamburgers, plants, fruit, whatever it is,
3189.242 or it could involve just fats
or just proteins, et cetera.
3193.197 There are at least three
factors that are going to govern
3196.529 how quickly you transition
from ingesting food to a fasted
3201.064 state, remember,
3202.383 as you ingest your last
bite or sip of calories,
3206.396 that's not when the fast begins.
3208.49 That might be when the fastening
begins on your watch or on
3211.133 one of these apps that
I'll refer to later,
3213.25 which can help you track your
fasting and eating windows.
3215.375 But that's not when it actually
begins because your body is
3218.472 still seeing food.
3220.22 You're actually carrying
around food inside of you,
3223.15 even though you're not
putting into your mouth,
3224.813 you're still eating in some sense.
3228.0 So it should be somewhat obvious
that very large meals are
3230.979 going to take longer to
digest than very small meals.
3233.78 So that will impact how slowly
or quickly you migrate from a
3237.929 fed state to a fasted state.
3241.082 There's no way I can spell out
what exact volume of food you
3244.779 should ingest based on the
size of your stomach and et
3247.68 cetera, but you're all familiar
with being extremely full,
3251.55 very full, comfortably
full, somewhat full,
3255.15 or not feeling full and feeling hungry.
3257.636 So learning to gauge
food volume is important.
3260.922 Also foods that include some
fats or a lot of fats will tend
3266.24 to slow gastric emptying time.
3268.019 And depending on the kind of fats,
3271.01 it could mean that a given
meal is digested within three
3274.37 hours versus five hours.
3275.417 And more fats might be a large
meal with a lot of fats has
3278.57 been, can take five or six hours.
3279.96 A smaller meal with less fat
is going to be digested more
3282.3 quickly consuming calories in
liquid form is going to mean
3285.426 that gastric emptying time
is going to be faster.
3287.868 And then of course,
3289.3 there's the glucose and
the insulin aspect to it,
3292.01 which is that foods that lead
to big steep rises in glucose
3295.051 like pure sugars.
3296.919 Then your glucose will drop, however,
3299.55 if they're combined with fats,
3300.86 then it tends to be a more
gradual rise in glucose and it's
3303.16 more sustained, et cetera.
3304.58 Fibrous foods will also create
a more long lasting sustained
3307.714 release in glucose.
3311.027 The important thing here is
to establish a feeding window
3314.23 that you can comfortably manage, okay?
3317.33 Meaning that on average,
3318.83 you can obey a six hour
feeding window or an eight hour
3322.6 feeding window or a 10
hour feeding window.
3324.83 And then to place that feeding
window in a social and life
3329.15 context that you can manage
on a regular basis, now,
3332.68 there are two key points that
have been gleaned from the
3335.33 scientific data about this
feeding window and when to place
3338.286 it.
3339.37 And this is based on a
really important experiment
3342.16 that Satchin and his
colleagues have been doing.
3344.13 There's a website that they
have zero-cost website called My
3347.28 Circadian Clock, you can go
to this website free of cost.
3350.461 There are a number of
important resources there,
3352.7 but what they've done is
they've examined the feeding
3355.68 behavior of thousands of people.
3358.382 People will take a picture of
the food they're about to eat,
3360.685 and it enters into their
account, maybe your account,
3363.86 if you create one on My
Circadian Clock, and they do this
3366.47 over many days or weeks,
3368.74 what's great about this is it establishes
3371.459 what's essentially called a
fetal gram a time in which
3375.35 people ate.
3376.56 And a number of important
findings have emerged from these
3379.413 fetal grams, across large
populations of people,
3382.646 different time zones with
different schedules, et cetera.
3385.51 First of all,
3386.949 almost everybody underestimates
their feeding window.
3391.08 Meaning people who think that
they are on an eight hour
3394.219 feeding window or six hour
feeding window, when their data
3399.112 are analyzed,
3401.05 it almost is always the case
that they're actually on a
3403.24 feeding window
3404.073 that's one or even two hours
longer than they think you
3406.217 think, well,
3407.27 how could that possibly be if
people are taking their first
3409.38 bite at noon and they're taking
their last bite at 8:00 PM?
3413.073 Well,
3414.27 that must mean that they are
on that feeding window of eight
3417.49 hours.
3418.4 And it turns out that people cheat,
3421.64 but they don't cheat in
any kind of obvious way.
3423.48 They might have, you know, a
glass of wine after dinner,
3425.989 or they'll have a cup of tea
and a little bite of a cookie.
3428.7 And so when people are
honest and they are honest,
3430.81 in most cases for this experiment,
3433.442 what you find is that most
people's eating window is
3436.16 actually quite a bit longer.
3438.203 So in discussing this with
such in and reviewing the
3439.33 literature,
3440.61 it's clear that if you'd like
to be on a 10 hour feeding
3444.97 window,
3446.01 that you should probably
select an eight hour feeding
3448.42 window,
3449.253 because there's always a
little bit of a taper on either
3452.87 side of that eating window.
3454.22 Very few people are extremely
strict about these eating
3456.986 windows.
3457.819 It's just hard to do in the
context of life events and
3459.444 social gatherings and,
and family and so forth.
3462.758 Okay, so as we build forward,
3464.71 your ideal fasting slash
time-restricted feeding schedule,
3469.86 we now have several different
rules that we can list out
3472.441 first,
3473.66 at least no food for the first
hour after waking up at least
3477.345 one hour, two, no food intake
3482.36 for two and ideally three hours
3484.55 prior to your bedtime.
3486.724 Three, if you want to select
an eight hour feeding window,
3492.475 then you should probably
focus on a six or seven hour
3495.75 feeding window because in reality,
3497.135 your feeding window is
going to be longer reality,
3499.893 meaning real life constraints.
3502.447 And if you'd like to be on
a 10 hour feeding window,
3505.212 you should probably select an
eight or a nine hour feeding
3508.14 window,
3508.973 because the way it plays out
is that people almost always
3511.09 eat outside of their
eating window, somewhat.
3514.64 The other nice thing about
selecting a slightly shorter
3516.849 eating window than is comfortable
for you is that it takes
3520.77 into account that as you take
your last bite or your last
3525.4 sip of calories, there's
this time or taper before,
3529.315 which you are actually in a fasted state.
3531.675 And because you're eating
different things on different
3534.16 days, presumably some foods
leave your gut more quickly.
3537.139 Some things spike your insulin
and your glucose more than
3539.539 others.
3540.546 Sometimes you eat more
fat, sometimes less fat.
3544.022 This allows you to fall well
within the margins of the
3547.607 benefits of time-restricted
feeding that had been
3550.6 demonstrated in humans,
3551.93 which generally involve an
eight hour window or so.
3555.654 So I think this eight hour
window or six hour window is a
3559.414 good thing to shoot for
most people, some people,
3562.418 and we will discuss the exceptions,
3564.54 but some people truly
are exceptions to this.
3566.466 They just require more food.
3568.965 And along those lines,
3570.69 I just now briefly want to touch
on some of the studies that
3572.91 have looked at using a very
short feeding window of about
3575.51 four hours, nowadays,
3577.34 a number of people are doing
the so-called one meal per day,
3580.02 or are restricting their feeding
window to just four hours
3583.7 or six hours.
3584.533 And that turns out to be an
interesting strategy and the
3587.706 data around it actually are
a little bit surprising.
3591.37 One surprising thing to leap
out of this massive literature
3594.348 review on time
3596.48 restricted feeding in humans
is that relatively short
3600.71 feeding windows of say four to
six hours do produce a number
3604.41 of positive health effects.
3605.793 Things like increased insulin sensitivity,
3607.975 which we know is good, remember type two
3610.21 diabetes is a reduction in
insulin sensitivity improvements
3613.32 in beta cell function and
the pancreas decreased blood
3617.118 pressure,
3618.13 decreased oxidative stress
decreases in things like evening
3622.928 appetite.
3624.14 So positive health effects
and psychological facts in
3627.39 general.
3628.6 However, they either produce
no change in body weight,
3632.657 or they tend to produce even
increases in body weight, now,
3637.87 of course there's variation
between individuals and between
3641.1 studies, but this is somewhat surprising.
3643.284 So the eight hour feeding window
seems to be very beneficial
3646.086 across almost all the
parameters that we've discussed,
3649.672 inflammation, weight,
loss, fat loss, et cetera,
3652.171 and adherence.
3654.34 I should mention people's ability
to stick to the diet seems
3656.598 quite good on this eight
hour feeding windows,
3659.555 but when people try and undergo
very short feeding windows
3662.51 of four to six hours,
3664.109 it seems that they are overeating
in that four to six hours,
3667.73 at least overeating with respect
to their metabolic needs.
3671.793 Now,
3674.215 the contrast to this is the
so-called a one meal per day
3677.227 schedule, very few studies
on one meal per day,
3680.375 one meal per day, unless
it's a very, very long meal,
3683.15 a sort of feast typically would
not last four to six hours
3686.273 because it sort of depends
on how you define a meal.
3688.547 But when you look at the
very few, I should emphasize,
3691.89 again, very few studies
on one meal per day.
3693.602 People typically maintain or
lose weight on the one meal per
3697.35 day schedule.
3698.59 So what we can say is that
the seven to nine hour feeding
3701.361 window produces all of the
major health benefits of
3705.083 time-restricted feeding
as well as being pretty
3708.649 straightforward for most people
to adhere to on a regular
3711.544 basis and on a regular basis,
3713.94 turns out to be very important.
3715.17 I'll get back to that point in a moment.
3716.64 Whereas the four to six hour
eating window doesn't seem to
3719.52 serve people as well as say
a seven or eight hour eating
3722.38 window,
3723.213 simply because people are
overeating during that eating
3725.46 window and the one meal per day,
3727.202 while perhaps ideal for
certain people's schedules may
3731.14 actually cause people to under-eat.
3733.41 And in some cases that
might be what people want.
3735.042 They actually want to under-eat.
3736.552 But when we start thinking
about in work and in sport,
3742.31 and when we start considering
hormone health and hormone
3746.05 production, fertility,
3747.354 that's when we can really start
to look at the seven to nine
3752.012 hour feeding window versus
the four to six hour feeding
3755.05 window versus the one meal per
day type feeding window with
3758.238 some different objectivity,
3760.65 we can start to look at it
through a different lens because
3762.69 it turns out that when you
place the feeding window and how
3766.869 long that feeding window is
actually will impact a number of
3770.633 other things in particular hormones,
3772.449 that can be very important for
a number of things related to
3776.61 sex and reproduction can be
related to performance at work
3780.48 performance in athleticism.
3783.76 And there are excellent studies on this.
3785.384 So let's explore those now.
3787.17 So let's talk about some
conditions where having the feeding
3790.81 window early in the day would
actually be very beneficial.
3793.735 There was a study that was
published recently in Cell
3796.93 Reports, again, Cell Press Journal,
3798.77 excellent journal peer
reviewed, very stringent,
3802.023 from Aoyama, et al,
3803.859 so this is AOYAMA, et al.
3808.08 This was published just recently
in July, 2021 that looked
3812.253 at the distribution of protein
intake in different meals
3818.229 delivered either early in
the day or later in the day.
3822.11 And I'm summarizing here quite a lot,
3823.65 but I should mention that this
study was performed in both
3826.459 mice and humans, same paper,
3828.85 mice and humans and involved
hypertrophy training,
3833.13 essentially increasing the
weight bearing of given limbs to
3838.08 try and induce hypertrophy,
3839.162 which is the growth of muscle tissue.
3842.701 It does appear that muscle
tissue is better able to undergo
3848.73 hypertrophy by virtue of the
fact that there's better or
3853.504 enhanced protein synthesis
early in the day,
3856.5 because of the expression of
one of these particular clock
3859.36 genes called BMAL, BMAL,
3862.509 BMAL regulates a number of
different protein synthesis
3866.122 pathways within muscle cells,
3868.226 such that eating protein early in the day,
3872.33 supports muscle tissue
maintenance and or growth.
3875.663 And in this study,
3877.49 they also looked at the effects
of supplementing so-called
3879.6 BCAs branch chain amino acids,
3881.9 which is popular in bodybuilding
circles and in strength
3885.176 training circles and BCAs
are essential components of a
3890.38 number of different foods,
but can also be supplemented.
3893.091 The takeaway of this study
is pretty straight forward.
3896.13 However,
3897.25 the takeaway is if your main
interest is maintaining and,
3900.25 or building muscle,
3901.365 then it can be beneficial to
ingest protein early in the
3905.23 day, you would still want to obey this,
3907.898 what we're calling a kind
of foundational rule of no,
3912.47 not eating any food for the
first hour post waking or at
3915.96 least the first hour post.
3917.258 And the cutoff for when you
would want to eat protein would
3920.71 be sometime before 10:00 AM.
3922.764 And there I'm averaging
across a number of different
3925.048 situations, but in general,
3928.124 this BMAL expression is such
that let's say you wake up at
3931.433 7:00 AM.
3932.5 Your main interest is in
hypertrophy or maintenance of
3936.11 muscle.
3936.943 Then you would want to ingest
some protein sometime before
3939.21 10:00 AM.
3940.043 But obviously if you're
interested in getting the health
3942.79 effects of intermittent fasting,
3944.43 that you wouldn't ingest any
food for at least the first 60
3948.22 minutes upon waking.
3949.36 Now it's not as if at 10:01
AM a gate slam shut and you
3954.22 can't generate hypertrophy,
of course that's not the case.
3957.381 However,
3958.34 it's very interesting that
it doesn't matter when the
3960.62 resistance training,
3961.68 the load bearing exercise
occurs in the 24 hour cycle.
3965.342 So whether or not in other words,
3967.7 people are training early in
the day or they're training
3969.9 late in the day.
3971.299 It still appears that ingesting
protein early in the day
3974.29 favors hypertrophy or that one is better,
3978.157 or I should say more easily
able to access hypertrophy by
3982.19 way of these clock,
3984.17 regulated protein synthesis
mechanisms by ingesting protein
3986.686 early in the day, in no way, shape or form
3990.27 does this study say that
ingesting protein later in the day
3993.24 is somehow bad for you?
3994.4 It just emphasizes the positive
effects of ingesting protein
3997.223 early in the day for sake
of muscle maintenance and or
4001.79 hypertrophy.
4002.98 So if you're somebody who is
mainly concerned with muscle
4005.15 maintenance and hypertrophy,
4006.407 then it may make sense to move
that feeding window earlier
4010.385 in the day.
4011.485 And certainly there are people
out there who are interested
4014.53 in muscle maintenance and hypertrophy,
4015.602 who aren't doing
intermittent fasting at all,
4017.747 and that's also perfectly fine,
4019.27 but this just so happens to be
an episode about intermittent
4021.276 fasting and time restricted feeding.
4023.857 There are of course,
4025.53 modes of eating where one eats
small meals spread throughout
4028.037 the day or weights meals differently.
4030.91 Such that meals early in the
day are larger than later in
4033.47 the day or vice versa.
4034.303 There are a near infinite
number of ways to organize this.
4037.208 But if you are somebody who
is interested in deriving,
4040.525 the many clearly established
health effects of
4043.507 time-restricted feeding,
4045.2 and you are somebody who would
like to maintain or build
4047.903 muscle,
4050.184 then ingesting proteins in the
early part of the day would
4054.669 be important to you at least
on the basis of these results.
4058.88 And therefore that eight
hour window that we've
4062.18 established as more or less
ideal shifted to the later part
4066.07 of the day might not be
as beneficial for you.
4068.101 Now I can just personally say that for me.
4070.945 When I wake up in the morning,
4072.8 it's very easy for me to
not eat until noon or one or
4076.307 2:00 PM.
4077.59 Eating early in the day is
actually somewhat of a challenge.
4080.158 I discuss this point with Satchin,
4082.445 because we were talking about
how is it that one can move
4086.43 their feeding window or place
themselves onto a different
4089.4 schedule of intermittent fasting.
4090.749 And it's very clear that one
needs to provide a transition
4094.303 period in order for that to happen,
4096.74 you should allow yourself a
transition period of anywhere
4099.26 from one week to 10 days in
which you shift your feeding
4103.37 window by about an hour each day or so.
4106.107 And then once you establish
a feeding window that feels
4109.81 comfortable for you and that
you think you can maintain over
4112.37 time,
4113.21 that you simply maintain that
feeding schedule for at least
4116.349 30 days, but ideally you
would do that indefinitely.
4119.879 Now this turns out to be
important based on data that
4122.306 they've gleaned from
this My Circadian Clock
4126.33 massive experiment that
they've been doing,
4127.81 where people are entering the
times that they're feeding
4129.72 and, and eating.
4131.292 Excuse me, anytime we talk about mice,
4132.983 I always think about feeding
4134.14 because I come from a background
4135.82 in my lab, works on both
laboratory mice and on humans.
4138.072 And anytime I think about
humans, I think about eating,
4140.28 but of course they are the same thing.
4142.977 The interesting thing to emerge
from that very large data
4146.25 set in humans is that when
people log their feeding times,
4150.394 as I mentioned before,
4151.73 oftentimes they think they're
eating in an eight hour
4154.3 window,
4155.133 but they are actually eating
in a much broader window.
4157.804 However,
4158.826 even for people that are very
good about restricting their
4161.559 feeding to a four, six
or eight hour window,
4165.15 if they're very strict about
the start and stop times,
4167.047 and when they ingest calories,
4169.062 one of the findings that's
really been important to note is
4172.247 that almost every individual
has a lot of drift in when that
4177.883 eating window resides
in their 24 hour period.
4181.22 In particular on the weekends,
4182.674 people are either extending or
shifting their feeding window
4187.426 in a way that makes it seem
that they've traveled to another
4191.06 time zone and are eating
according to another time zone.
4194.017 And this is extremely important.
4196.8 As I mentioned earlier,
4198.617 based on the 2012 study
from Satchin's lab,
4202.385 where eating at a particular
phase of each 24 hour cycle can
4206.788 help enhance the expression
of these clock genes.
4211.048 If you are eating within a
very strict or semi strict
4216.44 feeding window,
4217.273 but that feeding window is
migrating around from day to day
4219.763 or five days a week.
4221.28 You're really organized
about when that falls,
4223.98 let's say for sake of
example, from noon to 8:00 PM,
4227.19 noon to 8:00 PM, Monday
Noonday PM, Tuesday, Wednesday,
4230.13 noon to 8:00 PM, Thursday and so forth.
4232.52 But then on the Saturday,
4234.05 it's becoming 11:00 AM and
you're ending it early,
4238.94 or perhaps your starting
early in the day on Sunday,
4242.634 you're having brunch that
starts at nine 30 or 10,
4245.71 and then it's extending
out still just eight hours.
4248.27 But it shifting around that
can cause disruptions in the
4251.745 circadian clock mechanisms
that cause disruptions in the
4255.234 downstream effects of eating
that are taking at least two to
4261.44 three days to recover from.
4262.989 So obviously we don't want to
be overly neurotic about this
4266.54 stuff, but because this is an
episode about the science of
4268.511 intermittent fasting and
time restricted feeding, as
4270.87 important as how long
your feeding window is,
4275.855 is where that feeding window
resides in each 24 hour cycle.
4280.574 And perhaps even more important
than that is that it be
4283.9 fairly regular where that
feeding window resides.
4287.1 Because even if you have a
very short feeding window,
4289.1 if it's drifting around from day to day,
4291.21 that actually offsets a
number of the positive health
4294.305 effects of intermittent fasting.
4296.361 So to really just underscore
the way that these different
4298.842 pieces of the biological
puzzle fit together,
4301.943 if you are very strict or semi
strict about your eight hour
4306.04 feeding window,
4306.873 but on the weekends that
eight hour feeding window is
4308.77 falling later than it normally
would during the middle of
4311.88 the week.
4312.755 It is as if you are going to bed later,
4315.82 even if you're going to
bed at the same time,
4317.231 at least from the perspective
of metabolic health,
4320.11 because of the way that eating
impacts these clock genes and
4323.05 impacts, or I should say subtracts,
4325.567 the sleep-related fasting that
you would normally experience
4330.135 if you were to finish eating
that a couple hours before
4333.65 bedtime, so again,
4334.847 we don't want to create any
overly obsessive or neurotic
4338.075 focus on this, I think that most,
4340.75 all people could benefit from
a time-restricted feeding
4343.86 schedule,
4344.693 but they should really think
hard about what they can stick
4346.5 to on a regular basis and
understand that they tend to
4349.143 underestimate the feeding window,
4351.68 that they actually are partaking in,
4353.829 and that they should place that
feeding window in a portion
4358.35 of the 24 hour cycle that
they can be consistent on most
4360.936 days, and I want to emphasize most again,
4364.185 because we are not laboratory mice.
4366.62 We don't have a graduate student
coming in for eight hours a
4368.84 day because that's what their
significant other will allow
4370.76 them to do.
4371.593 And then removing the food
from our jowls and from our
4373.34 cages, we have access to food
pretty much, 24 hours a day,
4377.558 along those lines, however,
4379.461 there are things that we can
all do that will allow us to
4383.562 offset some of the drift if you will,
4387.789 that we experience or that we
induce in terms of when our
4390.446 feeding window occurs or that
the feeding window might push
4394.396 out a little later and then
therefore start a little later,
4397.57 the next day, there are things
that we can do in there,
4400.514 things that we can take.
4401.725 And so I'd like to discuss those briefly.
4402.63 So throughout this episode,
4404.38 I've more or less been alluding
to the fact that when you
4407.631 eat, there's some period of
time afterwards in which you're
4410.854 actually still eating,
4412.78 at least from the
perspective of metabolism,
4414.406 because glucose is up,
4415.85 insulin is up and you're
undergoing different metabolic and
4420.17 digestive processes that don't
really speak to you being in
4424.26 a fasted state, right?
4425.559 It's not just about when you
take your last bite or your
4428.79 last sip.
4429.919 However,
4431.034 there are things that we can
do to accelerate the transition
4434.075 from a fed state to a fasted state.
4440.4 And so I'd like to discuss what those are.
4442.22 And I want to emphasize that
the term fed state is probably
4445.862 a better way to think about
it than eating or not eating
4449.352 because we think of eating
the verb, we're eating,
4452.21 we're eating, okay, we're
done eating I'm fasting now,
4453.783 but you're not actually fasting
you because you are fed.
4457.692 So we should really think about
fed and unfed states because
4461.5 from a seller processes
perspective and from a health
4464.27 perspective,
4465.103 that's actually what your body
and your system are paying
4467.185 attention to.
4468.8 And by now with everything
that we've laid out,
4471.34 I think that should be
intuitive to understand.
4473.861 So there's a fun and exciting
concept related to this,
4476.91 which is glucose clearing.
4478.649 You may have heard the old adage
that if you take a 20 or 30
4483.04 minute walk after dinner,
4484.337 that it accelerates the rate
at which you digest that food.
4487.81 And indeed it does, clearing
out of glucose from your system
4491.73 can be accomplished through
a number of different means,
4494.86 but light movement or
exercise does increase gastric
4499.1 emptying time, so for instance,
4500.841 if you were to eat a meal
that ended at 8:00 PM,
4505.74 and then plop to the couch, watch TV,
4509.06 or get on your computer or go to sleep,
4512.066 it would be five or six hours
until you have transitioned
4516.104 from a fed state to a fasted state.
4519.038 However,
4519.871 you can accelerate that
considerably by taking a 20 or 30
4524.05 minute just light walk, it
doesn't have to be speed walking.
4527.3 It certainly doesn't have to be jogging,
4528.49 but just walking outside or moving around.
4530.878 So glucose clearing is an
important aspect of the transition
4536.127 from the fed state to the fasted state.
4538.377 And just a light walk can
allow you to do that, now,
4541.5 if you can't get outside,
4542.67 some people will go
through the gymnastics,
4546.23 literally of doing things like
air squats and pushups and
4548.94 things like that, and indeed,
4550.43 those will increase the expression
of things like glut four
4552.999 and things that mobilize glucose
into muscles and things of
4556.86 that sort, but, you know,
under most conditions,
4559.44 most people aren't doing
push-ups after dinner,
4561.26 or certainly who've had a big meal,
4563.15 just taking a light
walk can be beneficial.
4565.356 In addition, you could consider
doing intense exercise.
4570.581 Now you wouldn't necessarily
want to do that immediately
4573.208 after eating.
4574.19 So let's take a look at what
high-intensity training of any
4576.926 kind does to blood glucose,
because in this case,
4580.56 it turns out that when you
do high intensity training
4583.04 actually has opposite
effects on blood glucose,
4586.128 depending on whether or not
you do it early or later in the
4588.94 day.
4589.89 So a fairly recent study looked
at so-called hit training,
4593.07 high intensity interval training,
4594.408 which of course can take
many different forms.
4597.05 It can take the form of
circuit training with weights.
4599.62 It can take the form of, you know,
4600.815 burpees and pushups and sprints
and all sorts of different
4604.0 things.
4605.015 But high intensity interval
training is typically training
4607.04 that gets people's heart
rates up, you know,
4608.822 well above 70% of maximum and
then brief periods of rest and
4613.557 then repeating and how long
the high intensity interval
4616.44 training of course will also vary.
4617.567 There's there are a very brief, you know,
4620.67 six or 12 or 15 minute workouts.
4623.01 Some people can carry on
with high intensity interval
4625.58 training for up to 45
or maybe even 60 minutes
4628.46 in extreme cases.
4629.41 But when you look at the
studies that have explored high
4633.47 intensity interval training and
its effect on blood glucose,
4636.216 there are a couple of studies
that leap out, for instance,
4639.07 one that emphasized that blood
glucose levels will actually
4641.485 increase if high intensity
interval training is performed
4644.291 early in the day and will
decrease if high intensity
4647.294 interval training is
performed later in the day.
4650.623 Now the purpose for this
exploration was not to explore
4656.8 clearance of blood glucose for
sake of intermittent fasting.
4659.83 It was mainly focused on athletic
performance and whether or
4662.42 not that was better early in
the day or later in the day,
4664.4 et cetera.
4665.61 But we can extract some
information from these studies that
4669.771 are beneficial for sake of
understanding glucose clearing.
4673.227 If you have ingested food
throughout the afternoon and
4678.13 evening and late in the day,
4679.16 and you're thinking about going
to sleep and you'd like to
4681.84 enter sleep in a way that
is less fed and more fasted,
4685.144 then engaging in high-intensity
interval training in the
4688.73 afternoon will lower or
evening I should say,
4691.82 will lower blood glucose.
4693.726 And in that way will help you
accelerate your transition
4696.67 into the fastest state provided
you don't ingest something
4699.31 after the high intensity
interval training.
4701.58 Now is the increase in blood
glucose that occurs from high
4704.942 intensity interval
training early in the day,
4707.63 is that detrimental, not necessarily.
4709.59 So that oftentimes is
associated with the shuttling of
4712.135 nutrients to the muscles.
4714.21 They've just done a lot of hard work.
4716.0 So it's not that high intensity
interval training should not
4718.599 be done early in the day,
in fact, for many people,
4721.36 including myself training
early in the day,
4723.448 just for the way that my
psychology and biology works is
4726.26 always better for me than
training later in the day.
4729.08 And the other important
thing to mention is that high
4731.366 intensity interval training
done late in the day can be
4734.246 beneficial from the perspective
of glucose clearing,
4737.811 lowering blood glucose,
4739.7 and helping transition from
the fed to the fasted state in
4742.683 preparation for sleep.
4744.31 However,
4745.4 if you're ingesting caffeine
or anything to engage in that
4748.464 high intensity interval training
in a way that prevents you
4751.5 from getting to sleep well,
4752.512 then it's going to be detrimental overall.
4754.496 So the reason I mentioned
this is of course,
4757.567 because it's nice to know that
light walks after dinner or
4761.05 any other meal for that matter
or high intensity interval
4763.347 training provided it's done
in the second half of the day
4765.83 can lower blood glucose and
speed the transition from fed to
4768.847 fasted states.
4770.942 But I also mentioned it because
what we are really trying to
4774.253 achieve when we partake in
intermittent fasting so-called
4778.021 time-restricted feeding is what
we're really trying to do is
4781.544 access unfed states or fasted states.
4785.471 It's not really about when
you eat and what you do.
4788.52 It's about extending the
duration of the fasting period
4791.787 as long as you can,
4793.402 in a way that's still compatible
with your eating, right,
4796.615 not the other way around.
4798.436 And this gets back to this
key feature of our biology,
4802.1 which is that what we eat
when we eat, when we exercise,
4806.0 when we view light,
4806.92 it's about setting a context
or a set of conditions in your
4809.137 brain and body.
4810.807 So it's not so much about the
activities that you undergo.
4813.614 It's about the activities you
undergo and their relationship
4817.64 to one another over
time, and so in this way,
4821.46 it really beautifully highlights
the way that your biology
4824.25 is interacting all the
time light is setting.
4826.41 When you're going to be awakened,
4828.433 when you're going to be asleep,
4829.639 when you eat is going to be
determining when you're going to
4831.443 be awakened, when you're
going to be asleep.
4833.04 And when you eat is also going
to be determining when you
4835.253 are able to clear out debris
from your brain and body and
4839.261 repair the various cells
and mechanisms of your body,
4842.76 when you're able to reduce
those inflammatory cytokines
4845.334 throughout your body.
4846.97 And this is really the beauty
of time research and feeding,
4849.72 which is, it's not really
about restricting your feeding.
4852.041 It's about accessing the beauty
of the fasted state, now,
4856.19 there are other ways to clear
out blood glucose that involve
4860.108 supplements or prescription drugs.
4862.35 These are so-called glucose
disposal agents, glucose,
4866.88 disposal agents, such as Metformin,
4869.45 which is a prescription drug or berberine,
4872.51 which is an over the counter
substance will lead to very
4875.585 dramatic reductions in blood glucose.
4878.45 And so they shift you from
a fed to a fasted state.
4880.613 And I know many people who
take berberine before eating
4885.125 meals that include a large
number of carbohydrates,
4888.96 for instance, as a way
to clear out glucose.
4891.731 Now I've tried berberine before.
4893.349 And what I can tell you is
that if you take berberine,
4896.212 which by the way is very
much like Metformin,
4898.53 its effects are almost
identical to Metformin in fact,
4900.601 but it's much less expensive
and it's over the counter.
4903.85 If you take berberine
and you have not ingested
4905.663 carbohydrates, many
people, including myself,
4909.115 experience a splitting headache,
4912.19 you become hypoglycemic because
it is a glucose clearing
4915.184 agent.
4916.27 So if you're going to experiment
with things like Metformin
4918.93 and or berberine or similar,
4921.14 you want to be very cautious
that you're not clearing out
4923.967 blood glucose, that's already low.
4925.787 And the dose response for this
varies tremendously from one
4929.836 individual to the next.
4931.63 And there's a strong circadian component.
4934.06 So if some people react very
well to berberine early in the
4936.572 day, but find that later in the day,
4939.1 it provides extreme headaches
for some people it's the
4942.073 opposite.
4943.71 So I caution you in exploring
things like berberine and
4946.739 Metformin that you should
expect to experience a number of
4950.27 physical and psychological
effects that may work for you
4953.534 might be great for you,
4955.07 but might also not be
great for you, nowadays,
4957.373 there are a number of
commercially available,
4959.241 continuous glucose monitors, I've tried
4962.11 one of these, it involves putting
what's essentially a patch
4965.76 with a little needle
that goes into your skin,
4967.07 which is continuing
continually, excuse me,
4969.31 monitoring your blood glucose.
4970.567 And you can look at it
at an app on your phone,
4972.68 and you can learn a lot that
way about how different foods
4975.07 impact the increases in
decrease in blood glucose.
4978.145 If you're doing experiments
with berberine or Metformin,
4980.657 you can see how those
impact your blood glucose.
4983.566 You can see how exercise
hit training or otherwise
4986.645 impacts blood glucose, excuse me again,
4989.759 it's very hard to assess blood
glucose without a continuous
4993.9 blood glucose monitor, and
if you're not using one,
4996.84 you're mainly going to be relying
on subjective things like,
4999.6 oh, I feel like I have low
blood sugar, or I feel shaky.
5002.37 Like I have high blood sugar
or shaky cause you have low
5005.11 blood sugar.
5006.498 So I have to say that glucose
clearing agents that involve a
5009.976 walk or exercise moderate or
intense are going to be a lot
5015.54 easier to titrate and adjust
the levels of then things that
5019.36 you're going to take, where
you have to adjust the dosage.
5021.56 And then once you ingest a certain dosage,
5023.219 you're along for the ride,
5024.85 at least until the effects of
that particular compound wear
5026.918 off, it doesn't mean those
things don't have utility.
5029.49 It doesn't mean people aren't
using them because many people
5031.73 are, but they are potentially
a very sharp blade
5037.17 that is a double sided blade.
5038.93 So I encourage you to
approach those with caution.
5041.07 If you decide to at all,
5043.1 it's worth thinking about what
the low blood glucose state
5046.56 is and why it's beneficial as
well as why it might produce
5050.176 headaches.
5051.14 And in some cases can also
adjust the effects of other
5053.76 hormones in the fasted state,
5054.908 a number of different proteins
that are expressed in cells
5058.814 undergo changes in their expression.
5061.86 We talked about this
earlier, when we are fasted,
5064.371 we tend to reduce the activity
of a particular protein
5067.793 called MTOR mammalian target of rapamycin.
5071.09 MTOR is very active in cells
while they are growing.
5075.46 So throughout development,
5076.594 it's also very active in
cancers of various kinds.
5080.855 MTOR needs to be what's
called phosphorylated.
5085.322 If you don't know what that
means, don't worry about it.
5086.155 But phosphorylation is a manner
in which certain proteins
5089.66 are altered so that they can
actually be functional within
5092.33 cells,
5093.55 MTOR is associated with cell
growth of all kinds healthy
5095.88 and unhealthy.
5097.731 When MTOR is phosphorylated,
there's a marker called PS6
5101.347 so phospho MTOR expressed as PM6.
5104.581 If this is all escaping
you, don't worry about it.
5107.68 Phospho MTOR and PS6
are reduced by fasting.
5111.79 Now, this makes sense.
5113.46 If you think about it,
5114.293 because eating and growth are
associated with each other,
5116.845 fasting is not necessarily anti-growth,
5121.597 but it is not pro
growth, and when we fast,
5124.362 we see increases in cells
of things like AMPK,
5127.42 the sirtuins, things like transcription
5130.74 factors like FOX-O,
5132.21 ATF and ketones or ketone bodies.
5134.75 You may have heard of the ketogenic diet.
5136.32 What's the point of all
this biochemistry, it's not,
5138.347 you just blitz you with a
bunch of cellular biology and
5141.188 biochemistry.
5142.7 It's to say that we have cell
growth pathways involving MTOR
5145.29 and PSX,
5147.61 and we have cell repair and
cell shrinkage processes that
5152.391 are associated with AMPK,
the so-called sirtuins,
5155.349 which Dr. Davidson Claire
5157.88 from Harvard and others are famous for
5159.42 discovering and understanding
things like AMPK,
5164.14 these two different divergent
pathways of cell growth and
5167.28 cell breakdown and repair
and by breakdown, I mean,
5171.13 actual clearance autophagy, and repair.
5174.506 Those can be triggered by
being in either the fed or the
5177.93 fasted state.
5179.01 So one way I'd like you to
think about the fed state,
5181.71 not just eating,
5182.543 but having recently eaten
or the fasted state,
5184.937 meaning high blood glucose and,
5187.756 or you've recently eat eaten,
5190.239 or are currently eating
or drinking calories,
5192.667 is that when you eat or when
you don't eat, when you're fed,
5196.35 when you're fasted,
5197.183 you are either promoting
cellular growth of all kinds or
5200.37 you're promoting cellular repair
and clearance of all kinds.
5204.48 And so, again,
5205.313 this is about setting conditions
in the brain and body.
5208.34 It's not so much about
when you eat food A or B,
5212.095 it leads to increases in MTOR,
anytime you eat any food,
5216.339 doesn't matter if it's plant-based,
5218.25 animal-based fat, protein,
carbohydrate, doesn't matter.
5221.89 You are biasing your system
towards a biochemical state of
5224.567 cell growth.
5225.87 And any time you haven't eaten
for a while or blood glucose
5229.27 is low,
5230.11 you're biasing your system
toward a state of cellar repair.
5233.94 And this is why people who
do not suffer from any blood
5237.853 glucose regulation issues
take things like berberine as
5241.391 glucose, disposal agents,
or take Metformin.
5243.96 I'm not necessarily
suggesting that you do that,
5246.069 but it's because those
things mimic fasting.
5249.21 They create situations in the
body that promote things like
5251.951 AMPKs, and sirtuins,
5253.67 and others to push your
body and your system
5256.21 down a route of repair,
5257.299 even though you might have
just eaten a meal an hour ago,
5260.075 along the lines of the health
benefits of intermittent
5263.46 fasting, there are nice data
showing improvements in the gut
5266.962 microbiome and in particular,
5270.316 in the treatment of irritable
bowel syndrome and other forms
5273.86 of colitis in time, restricted feeding,
5277.67 meaning time-restricted feeding
seems to be able to assist
5280.501 people with those conditions,
5282.227 following the general parameters
that I discussed before
5285.45 eight hours and so forth.
5287.04 Why and how, well, by way
of intermittent fasting,
5291.72 impacting the expression of
these various clock genes,
5293.775 and because the clock genes
impact the mucosal lining the
5296.75 mucus lining of the gut,
5298.749 it appears that intermittent
fasting can reduce the amount
5303.684 of so-called lactobacillus
that's present in the gut.
5307.582 And lactose bacillus is when
in high levels is correlated
5311.464 with a number of different
metabolic disorders.
5314.33 At the same time,
5315.18 time-restricted feeding seems
to enhance the proliferation
5318.089 of some of the gut microbiota,
5320.604 like acetobacter and some of
the other ones that promote
5324.63 healthy mucosal lining,
5326.59 and that promote better
overall intestinal function.
5330.53 So these are pathways that
have now been established,
5333.42 and it appears that
intermittent fasting isn't just
5335.416 modulating these processes,
5337.39 but is actually having a direct
effect on the mucosal lining
5339.582 in a way that favors a
healthier gut microbiome.
5342.381 So it should come as no
surprise that many people who
5345.31 experience gut issues benefit
from restricting their feeding
5348.13 window to eight hours or so
per every 24 hour period.
5351.74 The other very exciting finding
about intermittent fasting
5353.813 is one of the major health issues
5356.263 these days is the proliferation
of so-called non-alcoholic
5361.67 fatty liver disease,
5362.823 30 years or so non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease was
5366.5 exceedingly rare to see in the
clinic, except in alcoholics,
5369.372 fatty deposits in the liver are bad.
5372.64 It is essentially liver disease.
5374.542 Nowadays children and
adults are showing up with
5377.641 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
5380.2 Some of these people are
obese, others are not,
5382.291 but it's a serious health concern.
5384.75 And it's growing in numbers all the time.
5387.316 A recent study that was
published in Cell Reports
5391.02 Medicine just a couple of weeks
ago, tested the hypothesis,
5394.89 whether or not the gut
microbiome or so-called brown fat
5398.365 tissue is impacting the liver health.
5401.81 And in particular nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease.
5405.519 The short takeaway from this
study is that contrary to what
5408.84 was previously thought,
the gut microbiome,
5411.111 while very important for a
number of other processes in the
5414.65 body doesn't seem to be related
to this non-alcoholic fatty
5418.23 liver disease.
5419.063 This is surprising to people
or should be to those of you
5421.48 that have been following the
gut microbiome literature,
5423.7 however, brown fat,
5425.469 which is a healthy fat that we
have between our two scapulae
5429.687 and in our upper neck,
5430.78 it doesn't tend to be
blubbery type fat pads,
5432.89 but it sits deep to the skin,
5434.61 but creates a thermogenic effect
in the body that is helpful
5438.71 for reducing the amount of other fat,
5441.51 the type of fat that we're
more typically used to thinking
5443.95 about and talking about
white fat and pink fat that's
5446.16 subcutaneous fat around
the abdomen and so forth.
5448.843 Brown fat seems to have a
direct correlation with the lack
5453.89 of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
5455.61 What this study showed was
that in people that have
5458.496 diminished concentrations of brown fat,
5461.951 there is a higher probability
of having non-alcoholic fatty
5466.847 liver disease.
5467.85 Now the good news is brown
fat stores can be increased.
5470.71 And again, this isn't going to
create blubber of brown fat.
5473.29 This is going to create increased
thermogenesis and actually
5475.51 make people leaner and brown
fat has a number of other
5478.186 important positive effects.
5479.464 Now,
5480.72 this is interesting because
cold exposure of anywhere from
5483.236 one to three minutes, two
or four times per week,
5486.77 or maybe even 10 minutes,
5487.71 two to four times per week
can increase brown fat stores.
5490.192 Also time-restricted feeding
has now been tied to the
5494.599 density of brown fat store.
5497.61 So time-restricted feeding also
seems to positively increase
5500.09 brown fat stores,
5502.14 probably because of the way
that brown fat stores relate to
5504.286 epinephrin and adrenaline,
5505.85 which tend to go up when we're fasted.
5507.752 What does this all mean?
5509.18 This means for sake of
liver health and for sake of
5511.422 reducing, or maybe preventing,
or even potentially,
5515.434 I want to underline potentially
reversing non-alcoholic
5518.5 fatty liver disease,
5519.333 time-restricted feeding also
appears to be beneficial.
5523.059 Many people out there are
interested in optimizing their
5526.48 hormones, and as we mentioned earlier,
5528.84 insulin is a hormone and
time-restricted feeding seems to
5531.064 have very positive effects on
overall insulin profiles and
5534.395 so forth, but anytime
you mentioned hormones,
5538.005 people immediately seem to leap
to the sex steroid hormones,
5541.43 testosterone, and estrogen,
5542.74 because indeed they have powerful effects,
5544.93 both in the short-term and
the long-term in terms of our
5548.28 mental and physical
health and performance.
5550.781 There's at least one study
that's explored the effects of
5553.79 time, restricted eating on performance,
5555.8 athletic performance, immune
function, and body composition.
5559.853 This was a study by Mauro, et al,
5563.09 that was performed on elite cyclists.
5565.11 So I want to point that out.
5566.69 I was a randomized control trial,
5568.565 but what's really nice about
this study is that it explored
5573.76 a number of different hormonal
parameters in people that
5578.23 were using time restricted eating,
5579.69 or that had a more extended eating window.
5581.471 And they tracked
everything very carefully.
5583.891 And the amount of food they
were eating was actually pretty
5587.235 considerable, 4,800 calories,
so that's a lot of calories,
5591.87 but then again,
5592.703 they were very active and
they've measured a number of
5596.04 different things related
to VO2 max, et cetera,
5599.559 performance and overall performance
at what they did cycling
5603.794 is not the point that I
want to emphasize here.
5606.91 Although there were some
positive effects on their
5609.22 performance related to
time-restricted eating, the point
5613.42 I want to talk about relates
to things that presumably
5616.253 relate to most, everybody,
5618.37 which are the effects on
things like glucose, thyroid,
5622.41 hormone, testosterone, sex,
hormone, binding globulin,
5625.91 which can bind up testosterone
and prevent the so-called
5628.725 free form of testosterone,
5631.0 which is the one that has most
of the actions in the brain
5633.567 and body.
5634.631 And the major takeaway
from this study was that
5637.849 time-restricted feeding of
the same amount of calories as
5641.72 the so-called control
condition, okay, same calories,
5645.53 but either compact throughout
the 24 hour cycle to an eight
5648.304 hour feeding window or allowing
them to eat over a larger
5652.243 feeding window did lead to
significant decreases in free
5655.935 testosterone.
5657.499 And I think a number of people
will raise their eyebrows to
5660.67 that and think, oh,
5661.77 well then maybe time-restricted
feeding is not for me.
5664.14 There are a number of important
considerations, of course,
5666.16 one is while they decrease
in free testosterone was
5669.846 significant.
5671.122 It's also going to depend
on where people start out.
5674.0 So if somebody has already
lower modest levels of
5676.18 testosterone and it drops by 10 or 20%,
5679.92 that could lead them into a
state of poor performance and
5683.23 wellbeing, whereas if somebody
has higher testosterone,
5685.409 a decrease will necessarily do that.
5687.93 So it's important to take
that into consideration.
5690.12 This is why I'm always such
a fan of people doing their
5693.08 blood work and knowing what's
going on under the hood for
5695.44 them, a very change in
hormonal profile was cortisol.
5699.769 So-called stress, hormone cortisol,
5702.7 of course is also naturally
released early in the day in a
5705.37 healthy way to wake you
up and promote alertness,
5707.62 but you don't want its levels
to be too high or to have
5710.839 peaks in cortisol late in the day,
5713.63 that's actually correlated
with depression and a number of
5715.65 other untoured things.
5719.181 I would have thought that by
restricting a feeding window to
5721.931 a particular time each day,
5723.691 that these hard training
cyclists would have undergone
5727.0 increases in serum cortisol and in fact,
5730.06 the opposite was true.
5731.408 They had significant reductions
in serum cortisol as a
5735.061 consequence of time, restricted feeding.
5737.313 I should mention there were
significant reductions in serum
5739.757 cortisol also in the control group,
5742.72 but not to the same extent.
5744.061 And the two groups did
differ significantly from one
5747.03 another.
5748.09 Now this is important because
if you just look at one
5750.733 hormone testosterone, you'd
say, okay, based on these data,
5753.903 time-restricted feeding is
reducing testosterone levels
5757.179 significantly,
5758.185 even though the number of
calories is quite high and is held
5761.0 constant across the study, but in fact,
5763.28 because cortisol is lower,
5765.388 it may mean that the effects
of testosterone or the
5768.37 reduction in testosterone is offset.
5770.3 And that's because cortisol
and testosterone are always in
5773.09 this somewhat of a dance
in terms of cortisol,
5776.089 inhibiting the effects of
testosterone largely and vice
5778.465 versa.
5780.19 So it is interesting and
important to look at the total
5782.853 gallery of hormones.
5784.45 And they did look at a number of hormones.
5785.88 They looked at other inflammatory markers.
5788.071 Those were not increased.
5789.409 That's not surprising if you
remember back to the 2012
5791.708 Satchin Panda study this
early pioneering study on time
5795.379 restricted feeding.
5797.02 They saw reductions in stress
hormones and in inflammatory
5799.959 markers in time, restricted feeding mice.
5802.655 And here, this also seems
to be the case in humans.
5805.373 So the takeaway is for sake
of hormone health, time
5810.214 restricted feeding is
compatible with quality hormone
5815.33 health, even in high-performing athletes,
5817.256 based on everything we know,
and that we've discussed,
5819.93 I would not suggest that
people restrict their feeding
5822.24 window to less than eight hours,
5823.77 especially if they're training
hard on a regular basis.
5825.803 And it's not just athletes
5828.7 that should pay attention to this,
5829.993 when we are working very hard,
when we are psychologically
5833.48 stressed, when we are studying for exams,
5837.01 or we are in conflict with
somebody on a regular basis,
5840.207 that creates a stress in the body
5842.92 that's very similar to
that of physical training,
5845.47 the body and brain don't
distinguish between physical stress
5847.89 and mental stress, it's
all nervous system.
5849.75 Remember that it's just
cortisol and adrenaline.
5852.06 There's no special hormone
just for physical stress versus
5855.292 psychological stress, so again,
5858.001 in thinking about what sort of
feeding window will be right
5860.45 for you,
5861.283 we arrive back at this eight
hour time been that seems more
5864.215 or less flexible for most conditions,
5867.045 even high-performing elite athletes.
5869.73 And I would say just by logical extension,
5872.263 even for people that have a
lot of stress in their life.
5875.12 And I personally wouldn't suggest
that people who have a lot
5878.231 of stress in their life where
the potential for stress in
5880.53 their life shorten their
feeding window much shorter than
5884.89 eight hours,
5885.723 because then you would expect
that you would start to
5888.24 increase some of the inflammatory markers.
5890.43 You would increase the stress hormones,
5891.797 and you would be decreasing
things like testosterone and
5895.98 estrogen, some of the
sex steroid hormones.
5897.75 So again, it's all about context
and the eight hour window,
5899.791 it isn't holy,
5901.33 but seems to be a really useful
guide to extract the great
5904.637 health benefits of
which there are many in,
5908.45 of which we've discussed from
intermittent fasting time,
5911.419 restricted feeding.
5913.218 And yet that it could still be
compatible with decent social
5916.329 schedules and for maintaining
hormone health in keeping with
5919.373 this,
5920.375 for women that are trying to
maintain ovulatory cycles or
5923.884 for couples that are
trying to get pregnant.
5925.906 I think it's also important
to not create a feeding window
5929.898 that's too short.
5931.576 The relationship between
feeding and body fat stores and
5936.191 glucose and leptin and hormones
is a well-established one.
5940.71 And we can summarize it very easily here,
5942.33 although I've done several
episodes related to this
5944.24 previously on optimizing hormone health.
5946.59 But basically we undergo
puberty when there's enough food
5951.084 and there's enough body fat
that the body fat sends a signal
5954.97 to the brain called leptin.
5956.35 That's a hormone that comes
from body fat signals to the
5958.47 brain to turn on puberty that's puberty,
5960.535 but even as adults for
women that are menstruating,
5964.689 there needs to be sufficient
leptin signaling to the brain
5967.99 in order to maintain ovulation
because of the way that the
5970.09 brain communicates with the
pituitary and the ovaries.
5972.84 Similarly for men fasting
or extreme exercise plus
5979.086 fasting,
5980.07 we now know reduces testosterone
it's impacts are not
5983.977 exactly clear, however,
if you reduce food intake,
5987.725 either in total calories
or in duration too much,
5992.12 you will suffer a drop in sperm
counts, fertility will drop.
5995.76 And this makes sense.
5996.593 The body is communicating to the brain,
5998.18 whether or not conditions
are sufficient in the body to
6001.163 reproduce and to presumably,
6004.39 and hopefully support the
health and wellbeing of those
6007.39 offspring.
6008.223 So there's a logical link
between body fat and eating and
6010.35 how much food is available
to you and how long it's
6013.784 available to you and the signals
in the brain that allow for
6016.711 reproductive success.
6018.49 There are some data that pointed
differences in the effects
6021.086 of intermittent fasting
for males versus females.
6025.03 Those data right now only come from mice,
6027.441 that study was published
by Satchin Panda recently,
6030.47 we still await the studies in humans.
6032.757 Some people do not do well on
intermittent fasting either in
6036.79 terms of mood or hormone health.
6038.87 And so everyone needs to determine
for themselves whether or
6040.96 not having a time restricted
feeding window is good for
6044.05 them.
6044.883 How long that time-restricted
feeding window should be.
6047.11 I think eight hours is kind
of a nice minimum to adhere to
6050.31 based on everything that
we've covered today.
6052.27 And for some people time-restricted
feeding is not going to
6055.851 be compatible with
hormone health, for them,
6058.18 for them eating more meals
spread throughout the day,
6061.014 presumably smaller meals,
6062.615 same caloric intake is going
to be more beneficial for their
6066.3 hormones.
6067.133 This is something that is
going to be individual and is
6068.86 going to have to be determined
on an individual basis.
6071.97 However, if you're going to
try time restricted feeding,
6074.338 I do want to remind you that
taking a period of three to
6077.05 seven or ideally 10 days
to transition into it,
6080.09 not just going,
6081.08 flipping from eating to three
meals a day that span from
6083.515 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM and
suddenly going to an eight hour
6086.42 feeding window,
6087.253 but rather winnowing down that
feeding window about an hour
6090.457 or so per day is going to allow
the hormone systems of your
6093.683 body, including leptin the
hypocretin orexin system,
6097.46 which are systems within the
body, that signal to the brain,
6099.57 that food is about to come
allowing those systems to adjust
6103.27 so that you're not
overwhelmingly hungry, irritable,
6105.766 and you're not throwing your
whole hormone system out of
6108.259 whack.
6109.295 I keep coming back to this
eight hour feeding window,
6111.91 and I want to provide a
little more basis for it.
6114.24 And just to encourage that
it's not completely arbitrary.
6118.243 The lengthy review that
I mentioned earlier,
6120.835 features a number of studies
that have used this eight hour
6123.46 feeding window,
6124.422 but there's a particular study
that I'd like to highlight
6128.28 mainly because I don't expect
people to delve into the full
6130.072 reference list of the other review.
6132.056 And this is a study that was carried out
6134.331 between Satchi Panda's lab
6135.991 and Krista Varady's labs.
6138.44 This is a collaboration.
6139.76 The study was carried out in
humans and is entitled effects
6142.75 of eight hour time restricted
feeding on body weight and
6145.59 metabolic disease, risk factors
in obese adults, excuse me.
6149.653 And this study essentially showed,
6152.7 I'll just read the conclusions
that an eight hour time
6156.56 restricted feeding produces a
mild caloric restriction and
6159.862 weight loss without calorie
counting, so that's key, right?
6165.07 These people aren't calorie
counting somehow just by
6167.14 adhering to an eight hour window.
6169.013 They are taking in fewer
calories than they're burning off
6173.862 and clinically it reduced blood pressure.
6177.9 So I mentioned the study,
6178.88 not because there aren't many
others involving the eight
6181.07 hour feeding window also in humans,
6182.435 but because the eight hour
feeding window has been tested in
6185.636 obese adults and non obese adults.
6187.86 And there are even a
few studies in children.
6189.901 So this eight hour window seems
to be a really good rule of
6193.33 thumb and a kind of anchor
around which we can each think
6196.562 about incorporating
time restricted feeding.
6199.94 There are of course,
other patterns of feeding.
6202.21 And while some people have
engaged in longer fasts of 24
6206.961 hours, 36 hours or more
alternate day fasting,
6213.16 meaning eating one day,
6215.24 not eating the next day or in
some cases eating one day and
6218.02 eating very few calories,
500 or 600 calories
6220.69 the next day has been tested.
6223.45 A few studies have also
looked at eating a sort of
6225.474 maintenance level of
calories for five days,
6228.45 and then taking two days
and fast clear through,
6231.561 or eating very few calories,
you know, 300 or 500 calories.
6235.91 In fact,
6236.743 there's a sort of a community
online of people that are
6240.09 exploring longer,
6240.923 fast for sake of trying to
offset dementia or reverse
6243.199 effects of dementia, thus
far, at least in my awareness,
6248.314 there isn't any quality clinical
peer reviewed study on that
6252.67 yet for sake of dementia,
although I await those studies,
6255.827 and if anyone's aware of them,
6257.57 please send me a link in the comments.
6259.11 But alternate day fasting has
gotten the so-called safe bill
6264.03 of health.
6264.863 This has been written up meaning
that people didn't suffer
6266.541 bone loss, they didn't suffer
any major detrimental effects.
6270.393 It does seem that it can create
significant weight loss and
6275.382 can help with obese individuals
that it can reduce resting
6279.228 blood glucose,
6280.228 and every other day fasting
in many cases can produce more
6283.331 rapid effects on weight loss
and reductions in blood glucose
6287.455 than time restricted feeding, however,
6289.85 every other day type fasting
for most people is not going to
6294.344 be feasible.
6296.14 They're just not going to be
able to do that for a long
6297.96 period of time.
6298.793 And what hasn't really been
done is the follow-up to see
6300.482 whether or not people who do
every other day fasting or five
6303.225 days of eating followed
by two days of fasting,
6306.15 whether or not that leads
to a rebound in weight gain,
6308.79 whether or not that leads to
a rebound in blood glucose,
6310.94 et cetera.
6311.773 So for now the eight hour feeding
window and time restricted
6314.8 feeding seems to be the most tested,
6318.715 supported in animal studies and
in human studies and the one
6322.594 around which I think
most people should orient
6325.67 if they're considering getting
into time-restricted feeding,
6328.27 it's also sort of hard to
imagine how one could include a
6331.534 significant exercise schedule
or work schedule on every
6336.25 other day fasting.
6337.12 Remember, in any study, people
are often being compensated,
6339.98 or at least are incentivized
in some way to adhere to the
6343.346 study.
6344.348 This is one of the major issues
that I have with any study
6346.91 that says that three or four
different diets are essentially
6349.617 equal in terms of their
ability to produce weight loss.
6353.35 Adherence is very different
in the outside world where you
6357.025 don't have a researcher
monitoring you where you're not
6359.4 logging all your food.
6360.583 Most people don't do that consistently.
6362.514 And we can take a little bit
of a neuroscience perspective
6365.038 on this to try and arrive
at what the best kind of
6367.727 organization of an eating plan,
6370.16 or if we wanted to call it a diet,
6371.64 we could would be for you.
6374.065 Many people find it easier
to just not eat for certain
6377.163 periods of each 24 hour cycle
than to eat smaller portions,
6381.65 portion control is very
hard for some people,
6384.327 for other people it's
manageable, but people like me.
6388.57 I don't eat half the croissant.
6390.68 I don't think it's a real thing, it's not,
6393.109 it's not available to me, I should say.
6395.34 Now, of course I could
eat just half a croissant,
6397.596 but I noticed that when
I eat the croissant,
6399.77 because they're so delicious
that it creates a rise in blood
6402.81 glucose a rise in the other
hormones and chemicals that are
6406.76 associated with ingesting
delicious, highly palatable food.
6409.763 And it's actually a lot of work
for me to just eat half the
6412.611 croissant.
6414.008 There's something that's much
more thoroughly satisfying
6418.585 about eating the entire croissant.
6420.69 And actually there's something
that somewhat satisfying
6423.39 about not eating the croissant at all.
6425.14 And just knowing that later I
can eat the whole croissant.
6427.43 Now that's me.
6428.4 Other people find that they
don't have any trouble with
6431.38 portion control that for them
just eating small bits of food
6434.85 throughout the day is what
sets them in the right
6436.79 psychological and physical
state for sake of work,
6439.44 et cetera.
6440.273 And I mentioned work and
mental focus because one of the
6442.193 aspects of fasting that have
drawn a lot of people to time
6445.598 restricted feeding and fasting
is the clarity of mind that
6449.519 people get.
6450.945 When first of all,
6452.9 they don't have to think about
when they're going to eat
6454.78 because they know when
their eating window begins.
6457.008 They also don't have to
think about regulating their
6459.036 behavior because they already
know when they're going to eat
6462.743 and when they're not going to eat.
6464.24 Whereas when you're restricting portions,
6465.655 you actually have to make
decisions all the while.
6468.147 You know, and I think I like
many people decide, well,
6471.515 you know, is that exactly half?
6473.41 Or could I have like another
wrong on the croissant?
6475.63 This kind of thing. I
don't negotiate with food.
6477.73 That's why I like a time
restricted feeding window.
6479.841 I know I'm going to eat for, in my case,
6481.95 I use a 10 hour feeding window or so,
6483.588 and I'll eat the whole croissant.
6485.82 I just don't have to think about it, now,
6488.176 the food choices that you make
inside of that feeding window
6491.34 are of course also going
to be very important.
6492.963 Certain foods will increase blood glucose,
6495.12 such that you're going to
get hungrier and hungrier.
6496.91 Others will maintain lower
blood glucose and will allow you
6500.37 to be more controlled in
the foods that you pursue.
6503.427 Those are all individual
considerations that are deserving
6506.094 of their own entire episode.
6507.696 But I do want to point out
that the advantage of time
6510.449 restricted feeding is that
it involves a lot of the
6514.26 decision-making in the brain.
6515.74 The so-called go no-go
circuitries of our basal ganglia,
6519.38 if you want to know this
areas that control them.
6521.41 Anytime we have to restrict a behavior,
6523.68 that's called a no-go.
6524.918 Anytime we engage in a
behavior, that's a go,
6527.395 no go behaviors require a
lot of what's called top-down
6530.8 control, and it's very
metabolically demanding.
6533.91 And so time restricted feeding
allows you to depart from the
6537.11 whole no-go go negotiation that
you have to undergo when you
6540.129 have to restrict portions.
6543.61 And so I think this is a
reason why many people have
6545.178 gravitated towards time
restricted feeding and why for
6548.26 people that don't want to have
to think about all that it's
6551.43 just very straight forward.
6553.01 One of the more hot button
issues out there is whether or
6555.85 not given equal amounts of
caloric intake and equal amounts
6561.232 of activity and equal amounts
of nutrients, et cetera,
6565.48 whether or not restricting
food to a particular window
6569.03 biases,
6570.01 more weight loss toward fat
loss versus loss of other
6572.839 tissues, because of course,
when we lose weight,
6574.562 we can lose that from any number
of different storage sites
6578.34 within the body, muscle
water, glycogen, or fat.
6584.175 Now this is such a hot button
issue that I almost don't want
6587.76 to get into it, but I'm
going to get into it anyway,
6589.4 because there are data
that are very interesting.
6592.287 This is covered in the review
that I mentioned earlier,
6595.812 that describes how if people
follow a time-restricted
6600.259 feeding schedule for long periods of time.
6603.81 So 60 days or longer,
6605.202 there's some metabolic
changes in the way that people
6608.195 metabolize energy that do seem
to shift the system toward
6612.638 more fat loss relative to burning
of other tissues when in a
6617.012 state of caloric restriction.
6619.15 And I want to say when in a
state of caloric restriction,
6621.68 because there's really no
way to cheat the system,
6623.97 there's no way that you can
ingest far more calories than
6626.37 you burn or excrete, when
I say excrete, you know,
6629.481 I certainly don't suggest
this, but there, you know,
6632.279 bulimics and other people that
have eating disorders will
6635.06 use laxatives at a way to
eliminate food quickly from their
6637.497 system
6638.33 so it can't be converted into
fat or other forms of energy.
6641.74 That's a very, in that case,
it's a pathological situation,
6644.787 but in general calories
in versus calories out,
6647.743 as I mentioned earlier as this
kind of foundational element,
6650.72 but in states of caloric restriction,
6652.675 meaning sub maintenance intake,
6657.374 time-restricted feeding does
seem to buy us more of the
6660.052 energy burned to compensate
for that deficit from fat and
6664.999 the way it accomplishes
it is very interesting.
6668.022 It turns out that it drives
more fat loss by way of
6671.93 increasing a hepatic lipase.
6674.21 This is something called LAPC
hepatic means of the liver and
6677.73 lipase, which anytime you hear
ASC is means it's an enzyme.
6682.35 So it seems to increase hepatic lipase.
6684.2 So it increases the enzyme
that metabolizes fat for
6687.605 lipolysis and energy production
and reduces something called
6691.459 CIDEC, CIDEC.
6694.44 which is a lipid droplet
associated and lipolysis inhibitor.
6698.66 Now that's a mouthful, no pun intended,
6701.29 but what CIDEC really is
this lipid droplet associated
6705.651 molecule is it can inhibit lipolysis.
6709.682 So extended periods of
time, restricted feeding,
6713.509 meaning eight hour feeding
window or 10 hour feeding window
6717.453 that's obeyed for several months
or more seems to allow the
6721.871 system to shift toward burning
more fat or rather using a
6728.663 higher percentage of fat
when in a caloric deficit.
6732.718 Now I doubt that this is going
to resolve the truly barbed
6737.14 wire, almost hairball,
6738.181 ridiculous online debates
about whether or not
6740.88 time-restricted feeding is
better than another feeding
6742.94 schedule, look,
6743.773 I don't think any particular
feeding schedule is holy.
6746.18 If you are sub caloric,
6747.33 meaning fewer calories burned
than calories ingested,
6750.18 you're going to lose weight.
6751.056 But the data seemed to point
to the fact that if you do time
6753.81 restricted feeding for a
fairly long duration of time,
6757.68 and you maintain that,
6759.04 that you are increasing
these lipases that increase
6761.458 lipolysis energy use from fat,
6765.301 and you're decreasing the lipid
droplet associated lipolysis
6769.063 inhibitors.
6770.36 So it's both a you're removing
the break and you're pressing
6773.74 on the accelerator of fat loss.
6775.506 I think that this logically
points to a case in which using
6780.328 time restricted feeding with
a sub caloric intake seems to
6785.64 be at least to my mind,
6787.26 the most scientifically
supported way to ensure that a
6790.048 significant portion of the
weight that one loses is from
6792.946 body fat stores.
6795.55 Any discussion about fasting
would be incomplete without a
6798.688 discussion about what does
and does not break a fast.
6802.224 However,
6803.84 there is no black and white
answer to that question,
6807.06 and you should immediately
understand why it's because
6810.855 eating and not eating are not
equivalent to fed and fasted.
6816.69 It depends on when you ate
how much you ate and where you
6822.38 are in your circadian cycle.
6824.81 We can actually arrive at a
simple answer to whether or not
6827.36 something breaks the fast or not.
6829.18 Now the technical way to go
about this would be to wear a
6831.102 continuous glucose monitor
and to ingest little bits of
6834.517 food, of different kinds
or large amounts of food,
6837.25 of different kinds and
measure blood glucose,
6839.85 because ultimately blood glucose
is the readout of whether
6842.736 or not your system is in
a fed or fasted state.
6844.797 There are other parameters too, of course,
6847.0 but that's the dominant one
6849.91 in so far as the scientific
literature says drinking water
6855.442 will not break your fast
drinking tea will not break your
6860.72 fast drinking coffee,
6862.52 provided it as black coffee
will not break your fast
6866.94 ingesting caffeine in pill
form will not break your fast.
6870.85 There are other things
that won't break your fast.
6872.67 For instance,
6873.669 eating one peanut when deep in
a fasted state will not break
6877.297 your fast, eating a whole
handful of peanuts might not even
6880.84 break your fast if you are
in a very low glucose state.
6884.75 However,
6885.583 if you just finished a meal
that included carbohydrates,
6888.01 or it was a very large meal
of any kind an hour ago, yes,
6891.638 indeed, eating one peanut
could break your fast.
6895.84 So it's all contextual, that's
6898.16 what's really important to understand,
6899.379 unless you're going to wear
a continuous glucose monitor.
6902.02 And unless you are going to
wear a continuous glucose
6904.896 monitor and set an absolute
numerical threshold for what it
6909.39 is to break your fast.
6910.659 I think there are some simple
rules that we can follow.
6914.034 First of all, anything that
involves sugar in particular,
6919.55 simple sugars can
potentially break your fast.
6921.86 And there's actually a study on this,
6923.44 which shows that if
people ingest even one,
6927.027 one gram of sugar post dinner,
6931.31 if they had a full meal for
dinner that can actually disrupt
6934.94 the expression of some of the
circadian genes related to
6938.201 fasting and to sleep and
sleep related fasting.
6941.94 Now that's pretty extreme,
6943.0 almost kind of scary to think about,
6945.12 but that's how sensitive our system is.
6947.58 If we already have somewhat
elevated blood glucose from a
6950.702 meal that we ate an hour or so ago,
6952.837 whereas if we have run
for an hour or train hard,
6958.14 high intensity training,
6959.354 and we haven't quite reached
the beginning of our so-called
6962.77 feeding window, will eating
a small amount of food
6967.272 take us out of that fast?
6969.4 Well, depends on what the food is.
6971.92 If it's mostly fat,
6973.19 probably not, a number of
people out there nowadays
6975.99 talk about so-called fat fasting,
6977.75 fat fasting as a way to kind
of regal past the stringency of
6982.599 either eating or not eating
as a black and white rule for
6986.792 feeding window versus non feeding window.
6989.64 So some people will ingest
medium chain triglycerides
6992.488 so-called MCTs,
6994.48 or people will ingest fats only
until their official feeding
6997.159 window begins.
6998.97 So these are sort of how the
negotiations that people carry
7001.082 out tend to go.
7002.348 But that of course won't increase
blood glucose and insulin
7006.26 as much as carbohydrates will,
7007.92 protein will have sort of
an intermediate effect.
7010.23 And as I mentioned earlier,
7012.09 ingesting carbohydrates with
some fat will tend to blunt the
7015.105 rise in glucose and will
extend the duration over which
7019.04 glucose is released.
7020.41 So we really can't say food X
or beverage X breaks a fast,
7026.971 however, at the extremes, we
can say that, for instance,
7030.105 if you drink a can of soda pop,
7033.384 unless you just ran an ultra marathon,
7035.624 you're breaking your fast,
okay, eat a piece of pizza,
7038.69 You're breaking your fast,
you eat purely fats, maybe,
7042.085 probably not.
7043.67 If you've been fasting for
five hours or more strictly
7046.684 fasting for five hours or more.
7049.15 So you can start to see where
there's a lot of wiggle room
7052.07 and it's very contextual.
7053.55 And this is why any posts that
you see or any information
7056.532 that you see that something
does or does not break your
7059.02 fast,
7060.233 that doesn't place it in the
context of when the last time
7061.583 you ate and what you ate and
your activity and your time
7066.576 within the circadian clock
schedule of 24 hours,
7070.51 it's a sort of meaningless
discussion, so in general,
7073.41 I think what's really useful
if you're not going to wear a
7075.63 continuous glucose monitor is
to try and be fairly strict
7079.192 about when you initiate your
feeding window and when you
7082.1 stop your feeding window
and as time evolves and you
7084.711 establish a more regular routine
of eating certain kinds of
7087.86 foods and not others that are
right for you because as I've
7089.845 emphasized before on this podcast,
7091.71 and I will continue to emphasize
keto works great for some
7094.41 people, vegetarian keto
works great for some people,
7097.29 carnivore diet works
great for other people.
7099.349 Some people are omnivores,
some people are carnivores,
7102.304 some people are vegan.
7103.854 All of that is great and fine by me.
7106.012 Everyone has to establish
what's right for them, today,
7108.3 we've really bypass the
discussion about foods of a
7112.91 particular origin or type
animal-based or plant-based.
7116.29 But all the same rules apply
within this thing that we're
7119.278 called intermittent fasting
or time restricted feeding.
7122.79 So what breaks a fast will
depend and what you want to eat
7126.074 or what you are willing to eat.
7128.25 That's a totally separate
manner from when you eat.
7130.576 But as we've established, when
you eat is vitally important,
7134.749 some of you are probably wondering
whether or not artificial
7137.74 sweeteners or non artificial
plant-based sweeteners like
7142.21 Stevia break a fast,
this will vary somewhat.
7146.39 And I have to say the data
on this are somewhat mixed.
7150.382 There is evidence that when
people ingest artificial
7154.295 sweeteners,
7155.56 that it can create a transient
increase in blood glucose
7158.79 followed by a transient
decrease in blood glucose below
7162.56 baseline.
7163.507 This is thought to explain the
increase in hunger caused by
7166.268 ingestion of things like
aspartame and sucralose and things
7169.43 of that sort.
7170.39 There are not a lot of
good studies exploring the
7172.542 plant-based non sugar
sweeteners, things like Stevia,
7177.204 even things like monk fruit,
7179.39 which is a separate category unto itself.
7180.818 There aren't a lot of studies on this.
7183.09 I think most people need to
establish this for themselves.
7184.776 The best way of course,
7186.04 would be to wear a continuous
glucose monitor to go into a
7188.357 fasted state of either
one hour or two hours,
7191.31 or maybe you've been fasting
all night and then ingest
7193.109 Stevia in whatever form you
want or coffee in whatever form
7196.876 you want with sucralose
or aspartame, et cetera,
7199.68 setting aside the discussion
about the effects of these
7203.16 things on the gut microbiome,
7204.162 which is a different topic entirely.
7206.422 I think it's fair to
say that in moderation,
7209.179 the plant-based non sugar
sweeteners like Stevia in
7213.199 particular,
7214.47 Stevia seemed to have a
minimal impact on overall blood
7218.24 glucose when considered over
a fairly large time been
7220.924 aspartame, and sucralose, saccharin.
7223.314 I think we can say more or less the same,
7226.11 but as soon as you get into
a discussion about those,
7227.96 you also have to get into a
discussion about some of the
7229.99 evidence published in nature
and other excellent journals
7234.22 now pointing to the fact
that when consumed in excess,
7237.96 not when consumed in moderation,
7240.02 but when consumed in excess
that those might have some
7242.07 detrimental effects on the gut microbiome.
7243.946 So do artificial sweeteners break a fast?
7247.387 It depends on the amount
depends on the type.
7250.38 And in general,
7251.213 I think you're probably okay
provided that you're not
7253.481 indulging in them too often, however,
7256.72 some people just by virtue
of tasting something sweet,
7259.554 feel a spike in their appetite
that makes it harder for them
7263.1 to adhere to the feeding window.
7264.75 And so this is why you can
imagine that a really well
7267.043 controlled study on this would
be very hard to carry out.
7270.31 And I'm not really sure that
it's worth our tax dollars to
7272.615 actually design and carry
out a study like that because
7275.329 there would be so much
individual variation in terms of
7278.73 discipline in adhering
to the feeding window,
7280.93 whether or not people experience
increases and drops in
7283.85 blood glucose, how that impacts them,
7284.944 whether or not they're exercising.
7286.37 It just becomes an infinite
variable space, as we say,
7289.239 in experimental science.
7291.01 So you really have to
determine that for you,
7292.792 but I don't think that we can
fairly say that artificial
7296.45 sweeteners break a fast.
7298.67 I think that would be
incorrect to say earlier,
7300.439 we were talking about
glucose disposal agents,
7303.157 both behavioral and compound
based things like Metformin and
7307.72 berberine, and in fact,
7309.34 cinnamon is even a mild
glucose disposal agent.
7312.12 It can actually reduce blood
glucose, lemon and lime juice,
7316.05 believe it or not, can
lower blood glucose.
7318.055 You may have experienced this
before of eating something
7320.46 very,
7321.293 very sweet and almost feeling
kind of overwhelming on a
7323.31 poisoned by how sweet it is,
7324.83 especially if you're not
accustomed to eating a lot of
7327.49 sugary things.
7329.08 One quick remedy for that is
actually a half lime or half
7332.128 lemon squeezed into juice and
drinking that just by virtue
7334.597 of the taste and by virtue of
the fact that it will reduce
7338.993 blood glucose.
7340.587 You'll notice that that
effect almost immediately
7343.04 disappears, that's not magic.
7344.625 That's the effects of acidity
on blood glucose levels.
7348.566 So there are a number of
things that can adjust blood
7351.65 glucose, they're not
necessarily disposal agents,
7354.11 they're not sweeping it out
of the bloodstream in the same
7356.45 way that berberine or Metformin would,
7358.16 or that high intensity exercise
at the appropriate times of
7360.91 day would.
7361.743 But there is one particular
thing that one can ingest that
7364.978 can help manage psychologically
and performance wise through
7370.75 the fasting portion of the
intermittent fasting and get you
7375.069 to your feeding window.
7376.671 And that's salt.
7378.576 I've talked a little bit about
this on the podcast before,
7381.5 but because neurons use salt,
7384.76 sodium and potassium and magnesium,
7387.19 the so-called electrolytes in
order to perform their magic
7390.54 of chemical and electrical signaling,
7392.18 everything you do depends on chemical,
7393.6 electrical signaling and all
that chemical and electrical
7396.06 signaling requires electrolytes
in some form or another
7399.86 neurons run on the passage of
ions like sodium in and out of
7405.364 their cell membranes are, I should say,
7408.26 across their cell
membranes to be accurate.
7411.28 Many people find that the
kind of lightheadedness,
7414.07 the shakiness that's accustomed
with having slightly low
7418.17 blood sugar can be offset by
taking a half teaspoon or so of
7423.227 sea salt,
7424.66 or even just a tiny pinch of
salt and putting into some
7427.01 water and drinking it.
7429.801 Some people find because of
the glucose lowering effects of
7434.54 acidity, that if they're feeling
kind of shaky and not well,
7436.98 and they put some lemon juice
into water and drink that it
7439.86 drops their blood glucose further.
7441.404 So there's a common practice
nowadays that's discussed on
7445.11 the internet of waking up
drinking some water with some lime
7447.97 or lemon juice in it with
a little pinch of salt.
7450.0 I think that little pinch
of salt is a good idea.
7451.751 What is it doing, how is
it offsetting all this?
7454.15 Well,
7455.18 salt water actually has a mild
effect as a glucose disposal
7459.295 agent, but it has a stabilizing
effect on blood volume.
7463.47 And so,
7464.4 because sodium brings with
it water and the so-called
7467.725 osmolarity of your blood in
your body depends on the salt
7471.69 levels in your blood and brain and body.
7475.456 Many people find that
they're feeling shaky.
7478.08 They're feeling lightheaded.
They can't concentrate.
7479.83 They think they need sugar or food,
7481.44 but what will actually
remedy that is some salt.
7484.56 And I know a number of people
that have incorporated this
7486.68 practice and have written to
me and saying, oh, you know,
7488.45 if I just take a little
bit of salt in some water,
7490.81 they may or may not include
the lemon or lime juice.
7492.53 They immediately feel better
and find that it's actually
7494.435 quite straightforward to get out to that,
7496.999 to wait until the feeding window kicks in.
7500.193 This is especially true for
people that are using caffeine
7503.219 because when you ingest caffeine,
7505.23 you actually excrete a lot of water,
7506.98 it has a diarrhetic effect.
7508.31 And with that water goes salt.
7510.21 So it actually causes
you to excrete sodium.
7511.886 Now the role of sodium in
blood pressure and hypertension
7515.983 is, you know, quite
controversial science magazine,
7519.311 one of the premier scientific
journals out there had a
7522.884 special issue all about
salt some years ago,
7526.09 talking about the research
around hypertension,
7528.097 indeed people with chronic
hypertension or high blood
7531.04 pressure or very high blood
pressure in particular should be
7533.59 wary of ingesting too much sodium.
7535.52 But for most people ingesting
sodium provided they drink
7538.881 enough water and they don't
have chronic hypertension or
7542.53 high blood pressure is
actually beneficial.
7545.64 Now that doesn't mean you
should be drinking seawater
7547.27 doesn't mean you should
be overindulging in salt,
7549.605 but many people find that they
can manage their mental and
7553.84 physical state and even
feel really terrific,
7555.684 real clarity of mind,
7558.05 and really enjoy their
fast when they're ingesting
7560.91 sufficient salt.
7561.743 And all it requires really
is a small pinch of salt,
7563.68 ideally Himalayan or sea salt.
7565.06 If you want to get fancy about it,
7566.19 but table salt would be fine.
7568.09 And just drinking that in some water,
7570.298 maybe with lemon or lime juice
to offset the taste a little
7574.05 bit can really stabilize one's
jitters and can stabilize the
7577.392 mind, and you might also notice
can offset that churning and
7582.768 yearning and appetite where
you can't imagine going another
7586.789 five minutes before eating
something suddenly you feel okay.
7589.53 And that has to do with a lot
of the effects of blood volume
7591.881 caused by ingesting salt
in the appropriate amounts.
7595.4 In other words, sometimes
you think you need food,
7597.833 but what you really need to
salt and salt can make you feel
7600.56 better immediately.
7601.607 I'd like to mention too
excellent zero cost resources.
7604.718 If you're going to explore
time restricted feeding,
7607.66 or maybe if you already are
doing time restricted feeding,
7610.85 I have no affiliation to either of these.
7613.312 The first is the website
that I mentioned before, My
7615.69 Circadian Clock,
7617.02 which is the website hosted by
Satchin Panda and colleagues.
7620.45 There are a lot of resources
there where you can log your
7622.493 food intake,
7623.49 get information about
time-restricted feeding all the
7625.6 science, the ongoing studies, et cetera.
7627.52 The other is the so-called Zero app.
7630.015 That makes it very easy to
mark when you're beginning your
7636.393 feeding window and when you're
ending your feeding window
7639.48 and in,
7640.313 so doing marking when you are
beginning your fast and ending
7642.18 or fast,
7643.38 where at least initiating the
beginning of the unfed state,
7647.62 as we could more accurately
call it, it's a terrific app.
7650.259 I've used it from time to time.
7652.01 I don't tend to use it in an
ongoing basis because I'm just
7654.027 sort of used to eating at a
particular time of day now.
7657.847 But anytime I've shifted
that window, for instance,
7660.702 a few weeks ago,
7662.022 I started moving that protein
intake in my entire feeding
7665.51 window earlier in the day.
7666.539 And because that takes
some attention on my part,
7669.565 because I'm not used to doing that.
7671.129 I've been using the Zero app
and I like it quite a lot.
7674.13 It logs your progress and it
gives you averages and you can
7676.39 see how many other
people are fasting again,
7678.2 totally zero cost. I actually
don't know who owns that app,
7680.354 but I think they've done an excellent job.
7683.15 The interface is really
terrific, and as far as I know,
7685.66 it's available for Apple and Android,
7687.39 but it's at least
available for Apple phones,
7689.36 which is the type of
phone I happen to have.
7691.51 So check those out, My Circadian Clock.
7694.213 You just put that into
Google, you'll find it.
7695.963 And the Zero app, both
excellent zero cost resources.
7699.84 In a moment I'd like to review
the parameters of a ideal
7704.155 feeding schedule for you and
give you the variables that you
7708.36 can plug into your lifestyle
and your preferences.
7710.769 There are a couple of things
that I would place into the
7713.31 category of frequently asked somewhat odd,
7716.776 but still worthy of discussion.
7719.247 For instance,
7721.28 people have asked will brushing
your teeth with toothpaste,
7724.6 break your fast?
7725.68 I think unless you're
swallowing the toothpaste, no.
7729.58 Now if you really want to
run out and get a continuous
7731.56 glucose monitor and brush your teeth,
7733.06 and you can evaluate that,
7734.28 but no people have asked will
a half glass of wine after
7737.968 dinner a couple hours after
dinner break your fast.
7741.118 Absolutely.
7742.287 It absolutely will.
7743.74 And it's been demonstrated to
do that based on the one gram
7747.87 of sugar,
7748.703 kind of eerie or scary effect
that I talked about before,
7751.85 scary and eerie,
7752.683 because it just seems
like one gram of sugar.
7755.18 How could it do that?
7756.013 But these are metabolic
processes and they are very
7759.65 sensitive, post-meal, a few months back,
7762.451 I did an experiment wearing
a continuous glucose monitor.
7766.081 And I got a surprise when I
discovered that going into a
7769.572 sauna increases my blood
glucose quite a bit.
7772.96 It actually spikes it as high as a meal.
7775.075 And then it tends to drop
back down to baseline or even
7778.14 slightly below baseline afterwards,
7780.68 when I talk to people about
this, somebody said, oh,
7784.16 it's got to be that the
continuous glucose monitor was
7786.529 getting disrupted by
the heat in the sauna.
7788.88 That's actually not the case.
7789.982 Turns out that when you go in a sauna,
7793.325 because you dehydrate,
you're losing water,
7796.563 I wasn't drinking water and
you're dropping a lot of water.
7799.935 The concentration of sugar in
your blood actually goes up.
7802.944 And I actually put these data
out in a social media post on
7805.657 Twitter,
7807.67 and people were kind of shocked
to see how much a sauna can
7810.982 spike your blood glucose,
now I do practice time,
7814.02 restricted feeding, intermittent fasting.
7816.61 I'm not super strict about it.
7817.94 I use a kind of eight to 10
hour ish window either early in
7820.362 the day or late in the day.
7823.439 I saw this effect of
the sauna, personally,
7826.034 the psychological and physical
health effects of the sauna
7830.611 are valuable enough to me
that I continue to use it.
7834.427 I'm just not concerned about
this increase in blood glucose,
7837.46 to the extent that I'm
going to eliminate sauna.
7839.59 I like to use the sauna three
or four times a week before
7842.188 sleep, so I'll use it an
hour or two before sleep.
7844.88 And yes,
7845.713 indeed it creates this big
spike in blood glucose that then
7848.0 drops based on change in the
concentration of blood sugar.
7851.411 I'm just not going to worry about it, now,
7853.22 if you're concerned about
blood glucose spikes,
7855.42 then you might be worried
about it, but in my case,
7857.971 it was one of those things
where it was interesting and it
7860.297 was worthy of discussion.
7862.86 I thought because it was
somewhat surprising to me,
7864.62 although it makes perfect sense
why this would be the case,
7866.85 but at the end of the day, literally,
7868.62 it just makes sense for
me to get in the sauna.
7871.05 Okay. So now you've
heard a lot of science.
7873.334 You've heard a lot of
examples, even a few anecdotes,
7876.62 and let's come up with the
ideal intermittent fasting,
7882.53 AKA time, restricted
feeding schedule for you.
7886.52 And when I say ideal, I mean,
7888.42 what are the variables
that are negotiable?
7890.72 What are the ones that are non-negotiable?
7892.867 What is ideal for you will
depend on the context of your
7896.66 life and what you are
willing to do consistently.
7899.54 So, first of all,
7903.02 we established based on the
discussion with Satchin,
7906.13 who is truly the premier
world expert in this area,
7909.44 who knows the animal and human
scientific literature better
7913.86 than anybody has written
this incredible review.
7915.844 And for whom I consulted that
7919.049 you do not want to ingest
food for at least I want to
7923.37 emphasize at least 60 minutes
post waking up, second,
7928.395 you want to avoid ingesting
any food of any kind,
7933.246 even one gram of sugar, remember,
7935.56 this is the ideal one gram of
sugar even would be too much
7938.766 for the two to three
hours prior to bedtime.
7943.473 He also mentioned, ideally,
7945.586 you are spending eight hours in bed.
7948.5 I didn't tell you that
earlier. I saved that for now,
7950.028 but ideally you are sleeping
that entire eight hours,
7953.936 but simply by being in bed for
that eight hours and avoiding
7956.826 food after waking for an hour
and before bed for two to
7961.25 three hours,
7962.083 you're starting to build out
the duration of this fasted
7964.644 period.
7967.335 Remember that the sleep
related fasting is particularly
7972.9 important for the health
benefits of time-restricted
7975.5 feeding.
7976.512 Again,
7977.345 the sleep-related fasting is
especially important because of
7980.456 all the cellar repair processes
that occur in the liver and
7984.582 the gut in the microbiome, in
the brain all over the body.
7988.391 And because of the way that
that coordinates the expression
7991.1 of the clock genes that are
then going to wick out and have
7994.73 many other positive effects on health,
7997.72 including weight and fat loss.
8000.6 But in addition to that
liver health, et cetera,
8003.856 an eight hour feeding window
as a target seems to be the
8008.969 best target feeding, at least
by my read of the literature.
8013.7 And in discussing it with
shuts such in shorter feeding
8016.78 windows of four to six hours,
8018.32 tend to lead to overeating
and potentially increases in
8021.587 weight.
8023.553 One meal per day type eating
do not seem to do that,
8027.854 but those are special cases in
that most people can't adhere
8032.345 to a one meal per day type schedule,
8034.775 at least not on a regular basis.
8037.16 And it's not very compatible
with most social schedules.
8040.13 Although some people may be
able to adhere to that in a
8042.083 straightforward way,
8043.34 but there aren't any robust
studies exploring the advantages
8046.637 of one meal per day.
8048.902 So if you feel there are
advantages of one meal per day for
8052.106 you as opposed to an
eight hour feeding window,
8055.773 well then by all means,
8056.973 use a one meal per day approach
or use a four to six hour
8060.202 feeding window and just make
sure you don't overeat in that
8064.21 window.
8065.605 Remember that most people tend
to not adhere to the eight
8070.87 hour feeding window, they say eight hours,
8072.385 but they tend to eat outside
of the eight hours a little bit
8076.01 on each side, so if your goal
is a 10 hour feeding window,
8080.945 you might want to set it to
nine hours or eight hours.
8083.655 If your goal is six hours,
8085.54 you might want to set it
to seven or eight hours.
8087.62 And this is simply based by,
8088.64 I shouldn't say simply
this is based on thousands,
8091.492 if not tens of thousands of
human subject data points that
8096.42 Satchin and colleagues have collected
8099.881 regular placement of the eating
window or feeding window,
8105.77 every 24 hours is important.
8108.3 You don't have to be absolutely
rigid and neurotic about
8111.14 this,
8111.973 but you don't want it sliding
around on the weekends so that
8113.84 it starting two hours later
and ending two hours later,
8116.302 a couple days a week,
8118.154 because then you start to offset
many of the positive health
8122.695 effects that have been
demonstrated for time restricted
8125.7 feeding.
8126.798 Remember if you eat your
food within a certain feeding
8132.166 window, but that feeding window
shifts by a couple of hours,
8135.599 it is effectively like
jet lagging your system.
8138.926 It is effectively like traveling
a couple times zones over
8142.364 eating there for a few days
and coming back when in fact
8145.698 you're not traveling,
8148.421 that's because of the
way that food adjusts,
8150.481 the circadian clock genes.
8152.7 Now you can offset some of
that through the use of light.
8155.52 And I've talked extensively
about how to use light in
8158.14 previous podcasts, but again,
8159.537 early morning and all day bright,
8161.97 light exposure as safely as
you can, ideally from sunlight,
8164.51 not through a window, et cetera,
8166.01 avoiding bright light in
the middle of the night,
8167.84 extremely important for mood offsetting,
8170.61 metabolic dysfunction, et cetera,
8172.404 not incidentally Satchin's early work was,
8176.283 he was one of the three
co-discoverers of the cells in the
8180.91 eye, the so-called melanopsin
cells that set the central
8183.39 circadian clock. So he was
a pioneer in that field,
8186.23 which led him to be a pioneer
in this field and so on.
8189.828 When should that eight hour
window be placed within each 24
8194.337 hour cycle? Well, let's
talk about ideal ideal.
8197.107 If you really want to maximize
all the health benefits of
8202.909 time-restricted feeding,
8205.563 you need to extend the fast
around sleep on both sides.
8210.16 You would place it smack dab
in the middle of the day.
8212.332 It would be a schedule in
which you started eating for
8215.98 instance at 10:00 AM. And you
stopped eating at 6:00 PM.
8220.412 An absolutely dreadful schedule
for anyone that wants to
8223.83 have some semblance of a
normal life. In my opinion,
8226.588 it's not really compatible
with most schedules.
8229.92 Although some people
might be able to do it,
8231.8 maybe you and your family or
your friends, your, you know,
8235.37 you're eating a late breakfast or a,
8236.861 and then you're having a
late-ish lunch around 2:00 PM.
8240.17 And then you have dinner at six.
8241.48 And then assuming that you
go to bed around nine 30 or
8245.11 10:00 PM,
8246.08 that is going to extract
the maximum amount of weight
8250.956 related body fat related metabolic
factor related aspects of
8257.59 time, restricted feeding.
8259.6 Some people tend to fall into
a category where they do best
8263.261 placing that feeding window
later in the day and provided
8267.436 it. Doesn't run too close to your sleep.
8269.7 Remember you needed a two or
three hour buffer before your
8271.79 sleep,
8272.623 where you're not ingesting
anything that's in order to
8274.94 extract the benefits of
time-restricted feeding.
8277.197 Well then starting your
feeding window at 12:00 PM and
8282.09 ending at 8:00 PM plus or
minus half an hour or so day to
8286.237 day, it seems like a perfectly
reasonable schedule for some
8289.72 people starting at 2:00 PM
and ending at 10:00 PM will be
8292.021 that schedule.
8293.641 Of course,
8295.1 you have to take into
consideration when you exercise.
8297.633 If you exercise.
8299.197 For instance, I like to exercise
early in the day if I run,
8302.451 or if I do some moderate or
light intensity exercise,
8306.088 regardless of what type of exercise it is,
8308.49 I have no trouble waiting until
my feeding window kicks in
8311.976 around noon or even 2:00 PM.
8313.957 But if I do high intensity
weight training, for instance,
8317.23 early in the day,
8318.063 or if I run sprints and I do
that at 7:00 AM or 8:00 AM by
8321.139 11:00 AM, I am very,
8323.44 very hungry and it's hard
for me to do other things
8326.503 concentrate, et cetera.
8328.49 Now I'm not neurotic
about my feeding window.
8330.78 As I mentioned before,
8331.63 I kind of let it expand and
contract a bit around the eight
8334.047 hour mark, and feel perfectly
free to do that too.
8337.1 We're talking here in, in ideals,
8338.92 not in necessarily practicals,
8341.84 but other people find that
they're very hungry when they
8345.81 wake up early in the day.
8346.89 If you're one of these people
or you're somebody who really
8349.908 is trying to emphasize hypertrophy
or maintenance of muscle,
8354.67 then it does seem that ingesting
protein early in the day is
8357.471 beneficial.
8358.844 That it can be more readily
converted into muscle tissue.
8363.155 And this has been demonstrated
in at least one study.
8366.52 There's another study underway.
8367.75 That's exploring this further
for people that are really,
8371.0 really interested in hypertrophy
and building muscle will
8373.15 then time-restricted feeding
is usually not the way they go.
8376.03 I mean, let's be honest.
8377.55 There are many people out
there who are eating four more
8380.254 meals per day,
8381.35 and they're doing that
from 7:00 AM until 8:00 PM.
8383.904 I realized that not
everybody is overweight.
8386.41 There is an obesity crisis. Indeed.
8387.632 You know,
8388.83 the percentage of obesity
and non-alcoholic fatty liver
8392.08 disease is just cosmic through the roof,
8393.81 at least in this country and
in other countries as well,
8396.023 this country meaning the US
but other countries as well.
8401.098 But there are of course,
8402.35 people that are trying to gain
weight through who don't want
8404.91 to lose weight or who are
trying to maximize physical
8407.35 performance or hypertrophy
or things of that sort.
8409.48 And so of course time-restricted
feeding for them might be
8412.251 as long as I'm awake, I'm eating.
8414.234 And I, you know, I tip my hat
to those people and just say,
8418.47 you know,
8419.303 provided you understand what
you're doing and the burden
8420.898 that,
8421.731 that places on some of the
other processes in your body,
8423.63 if that's right for you, then
by all means pursue that.
8426.38 Another thing that we can add
to this summary or key points
8429.81 related to time restricted
feeding is the use of glucose,
8433.66 disposal, agents, and or behaviors.
8436.045 If you find that you've eaten
too close to a period of time
8440.5 in which you would prefer to be fasting,
8442.17 that's when a 30 minute brisk
walk or even modest walk after
8446.242 eating can be beneficial,
8449.039 ingesting some lemon juice
or lime juice can help lower
8452.382 blood glucose somewhat.
8454.154 And then there are the things
like Metformin and berberine
8457.379 there,
8458.25 even some supplements out
there that combine things like
8460.62 berberine cinnamon,
8461.764 which can lower blood glucose
and things like chromium and
8466.515 things that have a mild
effect on blood glucose,
8469.16 but berberine and Metformin
are very high potency glucose
8474.708 disposal agents.
8476.092 And I mentioned earlier why you
would want to approach those
8478.74 with the appropriate level
of caution and figure out the
8481.187 dosages for you, and, and for some people,
8483.47 the dosages will be zero
milligrams is going to be ideal.
8486.307 And then of course we discussed
how making sure that you're
8489.81 ingesting enough fluids in
particular water and salt,
8492.682 especially if you're using
caffeine in order to increase
8496.756 your levels of alertness,
8498.12 regardless of where that caffeine
source comes from coffee,
8500.53 tea, or otherwise,
8501.699 that can cause the excretion
of sodium and can lead to a
8505.09 kind of shakiness,
8506.0 a lightheadedness and the
feelings of hunger that may or may
8510.67 not be related to blood glucose.
8512.968 Some people genuinely need to eat.
8515.03 I certainly would not
want to see people getting
8516.83 hypoglycemic to the point
where it's dangerous.
8518.837 Certainly if you are
diabetic, you, and in fact,
8522.091 for all people,
8523.18 you should consult with your
physician when exploring any
8527.45 major changes to diet or
additions or subtractions of
8529.706 anything, including supplementation,
8531.088 but for most people maintaining
relatively low to modest
8534.998 blood glucose levels is going
to be pretty healthy and will
8540.58 allow all the positive effects
of intermittent fasting to
8544.17 occur.
8545.24 And when you find that reaching
that start to the feeding
8549.22 window is challenging that
ingesting sodium can often
8553.38 stabilize your system
mentally and physically,
8557.04 and allow you to reach that
window often painlessly.
8559.959 And then as a final point,
as I mentioned earlier,
8563.7 provided that they are consumed in low,
8566.548 no or modest amounts,
artificial sweeteners,
8571.299 or plant-based non sugar,
8573.54 non caloric sweeteners don't
seem to really impact blood
8577.22 glucose to the extent that
it would quote unquote,
8579.55 take you out of your fast,
8581.214 but that like fat fasting is
something that's going to be
8584.74 highly individual,
8585.81 and that you're going to
have to experiment with for
8587.91 yourself and being able to
recognize when you're in a fast
8592.049 and when you're out of a fast,
8594.13 at a subjective level and not
constantly having to measure
8596.331 your blood glucose or do
things of that sort can be
8599.318 beneficial.
8600.7 And I think if you watch for
the feelings associated with
8603.257 eating and post eating foods
of different kinds in different
8606.83 amounts,
8607.69 and you watch for the feelings
associated with being fasted
8610.837 for long periods of time or
short periods of time of having
8614.202 gotten sufficient sunlight
of having trained harder,
8617.47 not trained hard earlier
that day, et cetera,
8619.625 you can do the most important thing,
8621.5 which is to start to learn,
to evaluate your own system,
8624.339 to run simple,
8625.92 safe experiments on your system
in a way that allows you to
8628.746 really establish the ideal
nutrition schedule for you,
8632.72 whether it be time restricted, feeding,
8634.72 AKA intermittent fasting, or
some other nutritional plan.

8664.39 if you're not already following
Huberman Lab on Instagram
8667.238 there,
8668.071 I do brief posts about science
that often are not covered on
8671.522 the podcast. So that's
Huberman Lab on Instagram.
8674.58 We're also on Twitter also @hubermanlab.
8676.256 Recently we launched a clips
channel Huberman Lab Clips.
8679.697 Please check out our clips
channel and subscribe there for
8681.98 brief excerpts from the
various Huberman Lab podcasts.
8686.04 In addition,
8686.88 please check out our sponsors
that we mentioned at the
8688.367 beginning of this episode,
8690.023 that's a terrific way
to support the podcast.
8692.197 We also have a Patreon it's
patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
8697.21 And there you can support the
podcast at any level that you
8700.11 like, during this episode.
8701.24 And in many other previous episodes,
8704.063 I discussed supplements.
8705.91 One issue with supplements and
the supplement industry as a
8708.53 whole,
8709.4 is that the quality and amounts
of supplements often varies
8712.508 tremendously.
8714.32 Therefore we've partnered
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
8717.01 because Thorne has the
absolute highest levels
8718.786 of stringency with
8719.87 respect to the quality of
ingredients and the amount of the
8722.61 ingredients matching what's on the label.
8724.983 If you want to see what I take
and get 20% off any of Thorne
8729.07 supplements,
8729.91 you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman.
8735.108 You'll see the list of
supplements that I take.
8737.12 You can get 20% off those.
8738.12 And if you enter the thorn
site through that portal,
8740.666 you can get 20% off
anything that Thorne makes.
8743.903 I know we covered a lot
of information today.
8745.574 I hope you learned a lot about
time, restricted feeding.
8748.659 I hope you learned a lot about
metabolism and energy and
8752.826 health and how when you eat is
as important as what you eat,
8756.949 and last,
8758.45 but certainly not least thank
you for your interest in
8761.11 science.
