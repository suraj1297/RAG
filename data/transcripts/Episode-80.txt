0.35 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.35 where we discuss science
3.437 and science-based tools for everyday life.
9.32 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.35 and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
13.07 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.13 This month, we're talking all
about disorders of the mind,
18.82 things like depression,
attention deficit disorders,
22.3 eating disorders, schizophrenia,
and bipolar disorder.
26.85 During the course of this month,
28.13 we are going to discuss the psychological
30.26 and biological underpinnings
of mood disorders of all kinds.
34.36 You'll learn a lot of science.
35.97 You'll also learn a lot
about the various treatments
38.19 that exist and that are in development
40.77 for these various mood disorders.
43.16 We will talk about behavioral
tools, things like exercise,
47.21 meditation, breath work,
but also prescription drugs,
51.27 supplements and novel compounds
that are now being tested
54.46 in various clinical trials.
56.44 Across the month, I think
you'll start to realize
58.5 that there are common pathways
59.85 underlying many mood disorders.
62.42 In fact, mood disorders
that look quite different
65.15 from one another often
depend on the action
68.07 of the same neurochemicals
or neural circuits
70.3 in the brain and body.
71.95 That actually should be
a point of great relief
74.46 because what it means is that
by understanding the biology
77.21 of one mood disorder or
understanding how one treatment
80.51 or behavioral intervention
can impact a mood disorder,
83.84 we gain insight into other
mood disorders as well.
86.84 As always, we will discuss
science and science related tools
90.69 that people could implement
should they choose.
93.26 Before we dive into today's topic,
95.69 I'd like to discuss a very particular
97.68 set of scientific findings
that relate to today's topic,
101.97 and that are important for
understanding all mood disorders
105.28 and all states of motivation,
happiness, and sadness,
110.58 as well as depression.
112.3 Basically, I'm going to
paraphrase a brief segment
115.06 of my discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke,
117.91 who I sat down with to discuss addiction
120.65 and the biological basis of addiction
122.69 and addiction treatment.
125.1 A very important aspect of that discussion
127.75 was when Dr. Lembke described
the pleasure pain balance,
132.17 literally the circuits in our brains
133.92 that control our sense
of pleasure and pain,
136.37 and ultimately whether
or not we remain happy
139.35 in our pursuit of pleasure or not.
142.34 This is an absolutely crucial aspect
144.48 to the way that we
function in everyday life,
147.12 and especially under
conditions of mood disorders.
150.87 The pathway that she was describing
152.49 is the so-called pleasure system.
154.55 However, what most people don't realize
156.49 is that the pleasure system
157.99 is also directly associated with,
160.42 and in fact is the very same system
162.55 that modulates mental or
psychological anguish and pain.
167.15 Essentially what she described
168.68 is that whenever we pursue something
171.01 that we think will bring us pleasure,
173.55 and that could be anything that we think
175.23 will bring us pleasure from
food, to video games, to sex,
179.46 to a particular job or goal,
short-term or long-term,
184.32 that we experience release of
the neuromodulator dopamine.
189.31 Now, dopamine is associated
with increased levels
192.36 of motivation and drive.
193.51 It is not the molecule of reward,
195.04 it is the molecule of
craving motivation and drive.
198.61 However, as Dr. Lembke pointed out,
201.52 when we are in pursuit of something,
203.6 there is a release of
dopamine in our brain
206.72 that makes us feel motivated,
208.36 and in general, it makes us feel good.
210.87 But very shortly thereafter
213.2 and beneath our conscious awareness,
216.05 there is a tilt of the pleasure
pain balance in the brain,
219.5 literally a shift in the neural circuits
221.29 that underlie pleasure and pain,
223.22 such that every bit of
pleasure or pleasure seeking
227.37 that causes release of dopamine
229.52 will be balanced out by
a little bit of pain.
233.86 And we don't experience
this as physical pain,
236.36 at least not at first,
237.5 we experience it as craving for more
240.09 of the thing that brought us pleasure.
242.42 Now, that sounds pretty good.
243.78 You get pleasure and then
you get a little bit of pain
245.67 to balance it out.
246.86 It's subconscious and you experience it
248.6 as the desire to seek out more pleasure.
251.36 However, it's actually
more diabolical than that.
254.6 And we really need to keep an eye on this
256.12 if we are to remain happy,
258.08 if we are to remain in
pursuit of our goals.
260.66 The crucial thing to
understand is that if we remain
263.69 in constant pursuit of pleasure,
266.26 the pain side of the balance tips
268.46 so that each time we are in pursuit
270.98 of that pleasureful thing,
activity, or substance,
274.34 we are going to experience,
276.45 we literally achieve less dopamine release
279.49 each subsequent time.
281.13 So we get less pleasure and the
amount of craving increases.
285.41 Now, after a certain point or threshold,
287.05 we call that addiction.
288.76 And the way to reset the balance,
290.417 and this is very important,
291.6 the way to reset the balance
293.49 is actually to enter into states
295.29 in which we are not in
pursuit of pleasure,
298.32 to literally enter states
in which we are bored,
301.8 maybe even a little bored and anxious,
303.83 and that resets the pleasure pain balance
306.68 so that we can return to
our pursuit of pleasure
308.94 in a way that's healthy,
and then in an ongoing way,
311.91 won't lead to this over
tipping or this increase
315.31 in the amount of pain or addiction.
318.16 So this is very important.
319.34 And if this seemed vague,
320.41 what this means is we
should always be cautious
323.2 of any state of mind
or body or any pursuit
327.78 that leads to very large
increases in dopamine.
330.86 And if it does, we should be very careful
333.24 to not pursue that repeatedly over time.
336.02 During today's episode, I'm
going to give an example,
338.1 a real life example of a
discussion that I've been in
340.86 with a young man who's 21 years old
342.56 who's dealing with a disruption
344.52 in this pleasure pain balance.
347.33 He is essentially depressed
and he's depressed
350.24 because of his ongoing pursuit
of a particular activity
354.26 that initially led to a lot of dopamine,
356.9 but over time has led to
less and less dopamine
359.33 and more and more of this
pain side of the balance.
363.41 We could call him addicted
to that particular activity.
367.17 Whether or not he's addicted
by clinical standards or not,
369.73 really, isn't important.
371.14 What is important is that he
experiences this as depression,
375.54 as low affect as it's called or anhedonia,
378.58 an inability to experience
pleasure from that thing
382.04 or from anything else.
383.5 And he's currently undergoing treatment
385.21 through a rebalancing of
his pleasure pain pathway.
388.16 So while I can't reveal
his identity to you,
390.01 that wouldn't be appropriate.
391.28 He did give me permission to reveal
392.82 the general architecture
of what he's coping with.
395.1 And I spent some hours with
him on the phone this week,
397.4 talking to him as well
as to the various people
399.77 that he's working with
to really understand
401.18 what's going on here 'cause
I think it can illustrate
403.91 the relationship between
dopamine, pleasure, and pain
407.93 for sake of addiction,
408.93 but also for understanding how
to avoid depressive states,
412.67 how to remove ourselves
from depressive states.
415.52 And as you'll see today,
as we discussed depression,
417.97 many of the molecules and neural pathways
420.46 and biological mechanisms
that we know can be used
424.49 to counter depression,
426.91 feed back onto this pleasure pain balance.
429.45 Before we begin, I'd like
to say that this podcast
431.82 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
434.77 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
436.91 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
439.65 and science related tools
to the general public.
442.63 In keeping with that theme,
443.77 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
446.64 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
449.42 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
451.86 that analyzes data from blood and DNA
454.48 to help you better understand your body
456.02 and help you reach your health goals.
458.02 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
460.84 for the simple reason
that many of the factors
463.43 that impact our immediate
and long-term health
465.81 can only be detected from
a quality blood test.
469.01 The problem with most
blood tests, however,
471.15 is that you get information
back about hormone levels,
473.77 metabolic factors, et cetera,
475.777 but you don't really know what
to do with that information.
478.52 Some things might be flagged
as too high or too low,
482.24 but really interpreting
those data and taking action
485.2 to bring those numbers into
the ranges that you want
487.54 is what it's really about.
488.61 An InsideTracker makes all that very easy.
491.87 They have a platform, it's a dashboard
494.14 that will tell you for instance,
495.92 what sorts of dietary changes
or supplementation changes
499.36 or exercise changes will help
you bring various hormones,
503.08 metabolic factors, and other
factors into the ranges
506.27 that are right for you.
507.73 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
509.35 you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.

518.89 Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.
521.9 Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral
524.48 probiotic drink.
525.91 I've been using athletic
greens since way back in 2012.
529.42 And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.
532.01 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens
533.75 and that I still take Athletic Greens
535.67 is that it really covers
all of my foundational
538.35 nutrient and micronutrient needs.
540.53 It has vitamins, minerals,
542.17 and the thing that's especially
important to me these days
544.87 is the probiotics,
546.64 because there are so many data
548.31 that show that having a
healthy gut microbiome
550.68 is vital to having a healthy immune system
553.26 and for healthy gut brain axis,
555.8 literally the functioning
of your brain, your mood,
558.64 various aspects of brain inflammation
560.45 or limiting brain
inflammation are facilitated
563.08 by having a healthy gut microbiome.
564.79 And that's facilitated by
getting the proper probiotics.
568.17 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
569.71 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
572.56 And if you do that, you can
claim their special offer.
575.03 The special offer is
five free travel packs,
577.21 which make it very easy
to mix up Athletic Greens
579.55 while you're on the road or in the car,
581.51 and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
584.22 Vitamin D3K2 have been shown
to have a number of different
587.7 positive health effects on hormones,
589.76 on cardiovascular health, and so on.
591.66 Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
594.38 to claim their special offer.
596.09 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Belcampo.
599.48 Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California
602.17 that raises organic,
grass fed, and finished
604.67 certified humane meats.
606.66 I don't need a lot of meat.
608.07 Typically my diet regime
is one in which I fast
610.82 until about noon,
612.19 and then I have a lunch
which is fairly low carbs.
614.47 So I'll have some piece
of meat or chicken or fish
617.69 and some salad typically.
619.84 And then in the evening is when I tend
621.23 to emphasize carbohydrates.
622.96 That helps me be really
alert during the day
625.17 and sleep well at night.
627.34 When I do eat meat, I insist that the meat
629.65 be of the very highest quality
631.2 and that it is sourced in humane ways.
633.88 Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures
636.06 and seasonal grasses,
637.17 and that results in meat
that is higher in nutrients
639.34 and healthy fats.
640.49 There are now a lot of
data pointing to the fact
642.66 that high levels of omega-3
fatty acids are vital for mood,
646.67 for cardiovascular health
and various aspects
649.36 of maintaining what's called
a healthy Inflammatone,
652.39 the various things in our brain and body
654.21 that maintain a healthy
inflammation response,
656.72 but one that doesn't go out
of whack or get unchecked
659.81 in any way that is detrimental to us.
662.33 If you'd like to try

676.99 Today we're discussing depression.
679.07 In particular, we're going to
talk about major depression.
681.8 The phrase major depression
is used to distinguish
684.42 one form of depression from the other,
686.5 the other one being bipolar depression.
689.75 Bipolar depression, sometimes
called bipolar disorder,
693.31 is really characterized by manic highs.
697.0 So where people aren't sleeping
698.99 and they're talking very fast,
700.44 and they're buying things
and pursuing resources
703.16 that they can't afford,
704.59 they're starting
relationships left and right,
706.67 they're manic,
708.08 followed by periods of
crashes of feeling very low,
712.33 lethargic, and so on.
714.38 Bipolar depression is an
absolutely crucial thing
717.55 for us to discuss.
718.71 And therefore we are
going to have an entire
721.02 separate episode related
to bipolar depression.
724.93 Today, we're going to talk
about major depression,
726.88 also sometimes called unipolar depression,
729.44 just because it doesn't
have the highs and lows.
731.66 It's more characterized by the lows.
735.0 We're going to talk about the biology,
737.44 the psychology, and
the various treatments,
739.78 behavioral, drug,
supplementation, diet, exercise,
742.66 all of that.
743.51 Before we go forward into the material,
745.39 I just want to emphasize
that any discussion
747.83 about mood disorders carries with it
749.89 a particular sensitivity,
752.1 and that sensitivity is one
related to self-diagnosis.
756.59 Today's episode, and indeed
in the future episodes
759.59 for this month on mood disorders,
761.48 you're going to hear various
symptomologies that are used
764.42 to diagnose and characterize
these disorders.
768.07 If you recognize some of these
symptomologies in yourself
771.61 or in others that you know,
773.38 that's an important thing to take note of.
775.26 However, accurate diagnosis
really should be done
779.33 by a qualified healthcare professional.
781.37 So at once I'm saying, keep
your eyes and your ears up
784.43 for things that sound familiar to you
786.38 that might be of concern.
787.5 And at the same time,
788.34 I'm saying don't necessarily
leap to conclusions.
791.63 Take those flags of
concern if they're there
794.14 and bring them to a qualified
healthcare professional,
796.51 and they'll be able to
properly diagnose you
800.01 as having a particular mood
disorder or diagnose somebody
802.77 as having a particular
mood disorder or not.
805.06 And that's an essential step.
806.94 I don't say this to protect us,
808.33 I said this really to protect you.
810.66 Okay, let's have a fact-based
discussion about depression.
814.7 And I promise you that where
we don't know certain things
818.33 about depression, I will
be clear to tell you.
820.73 In fact, we are going to
talk about some treatments
822.59 for depression that are
looking very promising,
825.09 and that right now are actually
being used more and more.
828.96 And from my read of the
mechanistic literature,
832.35 we're still a bit in the
dark as to how these work.
834.96 That's actually a common
theme of medicine.
836.56 Many times there are
treatments that seem promising
839.57 or that look really terrific.
841.65 And there isn't a lot of
understanding about mechanism.
844.54 However, any good discussion
about neuroscience
847.42 and in particular about mood disorders,
849.08 has to get into mechanisms.
850.41 So we're going to do that.
851.41 And in doing that, we're
going to frame the discussion
855.07 for the tools of how to
keep depression at bay
858.22 and how to deal with it
859.47 if you happen to find yourself depressed,
861.07 or if you know somebody
else who's depressed.
864.03 What is this thing we call depression?
866.53 Was I mentioned before, it has two forms,
868.48 bipolar depression, which
we're not talking about today,
871.38 and major depression, also
called unipolar depression
875.35 is the other.
877.07 Major depression impacts
5% of the population.
881.72 That is any enormous number.
884.19 That means if you're in
a class of 100 people,
886.83 five of them are dealing
with major depression
889.1 or have at some point.
891.2 Look around you in any environment
892.67 and you can be sure that a
good portion of the people
896.58 that you're surrounded by
is impacted by depression,
899.91 or will be at some point.
901.3 So this is something we
really have to take seriously
903.16 and that we want to understand.
906.2 It is the number four cause of disability.
909.51 A lot of people miss work, miss school,
912.43 and before then likely perform
poorly in work or school
916.32 due to major depression.
918.78 Now there's a very serious
challenge in having a discussion
922.69 about depression and it relates
directly to the challenges
925.54 in diagnosing depression.
927.92 Earlier, I did an episode
with Dr. Karl Deisseroth,
930.89 who is indeed a medical doctor and a PhD.
933.5 He's a psychiatrist.
934.333 And he made a very important point,
935.74 which is that the field of
psychiatry and psychology
939.92 are confronted with a challenge,
941.37 which is they're trying to
understand what's going on
943.47 within the stuff that's in our brains
947.34 that's deep to our skulls.
949.49 We don't have access to
that without brain imaging
951.67 and electrodes and things like that.
953.55 Someone just comes into the
office and the dissection tool
956.7 for depression so to speak is language.
959.55 In order to determine if
somebody has depression or not,
963.33 we have to use language,
how they talk about things,
965.7 also how they carry their body.
967.3 Also some general patterns of health.
969.67 So let's talk about depression
971.88 the way that clinicians
talk about depression,
974.55 because one of the issues is that
976.61 we use the word depression loosely.
979.21 A lot of people say,
"Oh, I'm so depressed.
981.737 "I didn't get this job
or I'm so depressed.
984.187 "I just don't know, I
had a really rough week
985.877 "or I'm exhausted.
987.267 "I'm so depressed or I'm so depressed
989.187 "I thought I was going to go on vacation
990.527 "and then they canceled the flight." Okay.
992.68 That is not clinical depression.
995.29 That's called being bummed
out, being sad or disappointed.
998.35 Now that person might be depressed,
999.81 but clinical depression
1001.07 actually has some very specific criteria.
1003.93 And those criteria are
mainly characterized
1008.46 by the presence of certain things
1011.2 and the absence of a
few particular things.
1014.62 So let's talk about the
things that are present
1017.56 in somebody that has major depression.
1020.52 First of all, there tends
to be a lot of grief.
1023.93 There tends to be a lot of sadness.
1025.17 That's no surprise.
1026.61 The threshold to cry is often
a signature of depression.
1030.18 Now that doesn't mean
that if you cry easily,
1032.2 that you're depressed.
1033.04 Some people cry more easily than others,
1035.15 but if you're somebody who
typically didn't cry easily
1037.61 and suddenly you find
yourself crying very easily,
1040.29 that could be a sign of depression.
1042.207 And I want to emphasize, could.
1044.82 There's also this thing
that we call anhedonia,
1047.43 a general lack of ability to enjoy things,
1050.46 things that typically or
previously we enjoyed.
1053.12 Things like food, things like
sex, things like exercise,
1056.04 things like social gatherings,
1058.07 a kind of lack of enjoyment
from those things.
1061.19 Sometimes that lack of enjoyment is sad,
1064.36 and sometimes it's just flat,
it's just kind of neutral.
1067.85 It doesn't feel good
because nothing there.
1069.98 It's like bland food.
1071.52 It's like these experiences are analogous
1075.49 to biting into your
favorite article of food
1078.54 and it just not tasting very good.
1081.01 It just doesn't taste
like anything at all.
1082.75 And that's a common symptom
of major depression.
1086.01 The other one is guilt.
1088.23 Oftentimes people with
depression will feel very guilty
1091.16 about things they have done in the past,
1092.83 or they'll just generally
feel badly about themselves.
1096.1 And we're going to talk
about this because it relates
1098.6 to some of the more serious symptomology
1100.34 seen in depression sometimes,
1101.69 things like self harm,
mutilation, or even suicide.
1105.14 But for the time being, we
want to frame up anhedonia,
1108.64 this lack of ability to
achieve or experience pleasure,
1111.86 or kind of a flat affect as it's called.
1114.72 Sometimes even delusional thinking,
1117.55 negative delusional thinking,
1119.15 and in particular anti-self confabulation.
1123.12 What is anti-self confabulation?
1124.73 Well, first of all, confabulation
is an incredible aspect
1128.18 of our mind and our nervous system.
1130.25 You sometimes see other
forms of confabulation
1133.52 in people who have memory deficits
1135.46 either because they have brain damage
1137.27 or they have age-related dementia.
1140.24 A good example of this would be someone
1142.17 with age related dementia
sometimes will find themselves
1145.96 in a location in the house and
not know how they got there.
1149.66 And if you ask them, "Oh,
what are you doing here?"
1152.35 They will create these elaborate stories.
1154.247 "Oh, I was thinking about
going to the shopping today,
1156.827 "and I was going to take the bus,
1159.017 "and then I was going to do this."
1159.85 They create these elaborate
stories, they confabulate.
1163.02 And yet that person hasn't
left the house in weeks
1165.11 and that person doesn't
have a driver's license.
1166.78 And so they're really
just creating this stuff.
1168.67 They're not lying to get out of anything,
1170.78 they're confabulating.
1171.71 It's as if a brain circuit
that writes stories,
1174.4 just starts generating content.
1177.75 In major depression,
1178.78 there's often a state of
delusional anti-self confabulation,
1182.64 where the confabulation are not directly
1185.94 or completely linked to reality,
1188.19 but they are ones that make the self,
1190.87 the person describing them,
1192.55 seem sick or in some way not well.
1196.95 A good example would be somebody
1198.25 who experiences a physical injury perhaps.
1200.82 Maybe they break their
ankle, maybe it's an athlete,
1202.93 and they also happen to become depressed.
1206.3 And you'll talk to them and
say, "How are things going?
1207.987 "How's your rehab though?"
1209.233 And they go, "Oh, it's
okay. And I don't know.
1211.097 "I feel like I'm getting
weaker and weaker by the day.
1213.497 "I'm just not performing well."
1214.607 And then you'll talk to the person
1216.1 that they're working with,
1217.75 their kinesiologist or whoever
the physical therapist is.
1221.15 And they'll say, "No, they're
actually really improving.
1222.987 "And I tell them they're improving,
1224.057 "but somehow they're not
seeing that improvement,
1226.757 "they're not registering
that improvement."
1228.66 You notice that sometimes it's subtle
1230.5 and sometimes it's severe, but
they'll start confabulating.
1233.76 You'll say, "I actually heard
you're doing much better.
1236.367 "You're getting better,
you're taking multiple trips
1239.337 "around the building now
1240.287 "before you could barely get out of bed."
1242.13 And they'll say,
1243.177 "Yeah, well basically,
they changed some things
1245.537 "about the parking lot that
make it easier to move around.
1248.717 "So it's not really me."
1250.13 And these aren't people that
are just explaining away
1252.45 their accomplishments
1254.79 'cause they're trying to brush off praise.
1257.03 They are viewing themselves
1259.42 and they're confabulating
according to a view
1262.13 that is very self-deprecating
1264.8 to the point where it doesn't
match up with reality.
1267.54 It's not what other people see
1268.95 and it's actually not
matched up with reality.
1271.53 And that's a symptom of depression
1273.81 that I think we don't often think about
1276.11 or conceptualize enough.
1278.06 So it's not just telling people,
1279.477 "oh yeah, it's not as good as
it seems. Everything's bad."
1282.8 These people really believe that
1284.23 and it becomes disconnected from reality.
1286.34 So it's if they're sort
of sinking into a pit
1288.41 and they're losing touch with
the realities of the world,
1291.01 including data about themselves,
1293.01 their ability to move and get around it,
1295.41 for example, in that particular instance
1297.96 that I used as an example,
but there are others as well.
1301.0 The other common symptomology
of major depression
1305.4 is what they call
vegetative symptoms, okay?
1308.75 So vegetative symptoms
are symptoms that occur
1312.3 without any thinking, without any doing,
1315.1 or without any confabulation.
1316.49 These are things that are
related to our core physiology.
1319.13 The word vegetative,
1320.49 you might know it sounds like vegetable.
1322.12 It actually relates to
a system in the body
1324.57 that nowadays is more commonly called
1326.2 the autonomic nervous system.
1328.53 The vegetative nervous system
1330.407 and the autonomic nervous system,
1332.36 historically were considered
sort of one in the same.
1335.06 And it relates to things
like the stress response
1337.86 or to our ability to sleep.
1339.76 So vegetative symptoms
1341.33 be things like constantly being exhausted.
1344.43 The person just feels exhausted.
1346.77 It's not because they exercise too much,
1348.42 it's not necessarily because
of a life event, it could be,
1351.67 but they're just worn out.
1353.46 They don't have the energy they once had.
1356.13 So it's not in their heads, it's probably,
1359.43 and now I think we have good
data to support the fact
1361.63 that there's something off,
1363.53 something is disrupted in the autonomic
1365.57 or so-called vegetative nervous system.
1367.397 And one of the most common symptoms
1369.45 of people with major depression,
1371.27 one of the signs of major
depression is early waking
1375.54 and not being able to fall back asleep
1377.61 despite being exhausted.
1379.87 So waking up at 3:00 AM
or 4:00 AM or 5:00 AM
1383.25 just spontaneously and not
being able to go back to sleep.
1386.26 I want to emphasize that that could happen
1387.95 for other reasons as well,
but it is a common symptom
1392.0 or warning sign of major depression.
1394.57 So let's talk more about
sleep and depression.
1397.93 It's well-known that the
architecture of sleep
1401.5 is disrupted in depression.
1403.36 What's the architecture of sleep?
1404.7 I've done entire episodes about this,
1406.15 but very briefly in two sentences,
1408.38 although they're probably
be run on sentences,
1411.18 early in the night,
1412.54 you tend to have slow wave
sleep more than REM sleep
1415.37 or Rapid Eye Movement sleep.
1416.66 As the night goes on,
1417.54 you tend to have more
Rapid Eye Movement sleep.
1419.92 That architecture of slow wave sleep
1422.45 preceding Rapid Eye Movement sleep
1424.88 is radically disrupted
in major depression.
1429.88 In addition, the pattern
of activity in the brain
1432.26 during particular phases
of sleep is disrupted.
1435.23 Now this is during sleep.
1436.48 So this can't be that people
1437.79 are creating this
situation for themselves.
1439.68 These are real physiological
signs that something is off
1443.16 in this so-called autonomic
or vegetative nervous system.
1446.93 And then there are some
other things that relate
1448.83 to the autonomic nervous system,
1450.83 but that we normally think of
as more voluntary in nature.
1454.6 And these are things
like decreased appetite.
1457.21 So you can imagine that one
could have decreased appetite
1461.21 because of the anhedonia,
1462.72 the lack of pleasure from food, right?
1464.7 If you don't enjoy food,
1465.8 then you might be less
motivated to eat it.
1468.57 That makes sense.
1469.72 As well because of these disruptions
1471.52 in the autonomic nervous system,
1473.29 these vegetative symptoms,
as they're called,
1475.57 you can imagine that someone
would have decreased appetite
1477.79 because some of the hormones
associated with appetite,
1480.569 hypocretin orexin and things
of that sort, ghrelin,
1483.9 that those will be disrupted.
1485.52 And if those names of
hypocretin orexin and ghrelin
1487.71 don't make any sense to
you, don't worry about it.
1489.86 What those are just hormones
that impact when we eat,
1493.21 when we feel hungry, and
when we crave food more,
1497.17 as well as when we feel full,
1498.65 we have enough so-called satiety.
1500.48 If you want to learn more about those,
1501.73 we did entire episodes
on eating and metabolism.
1504.75 So you can see that the
symptomology of major depression
1507.97 impacts us at multiple levels.
1509.83 There's the conscious level of
how excited we are generally.
1514.2 Well, that's reduced.
1515.38 There's grief, there's
guilt, there's crying,
1518.62 but then there's also
these vegetative things.
1520.69 There's disruptions in sleep,
1521.9 which of course make
everything more challenging
1523.88 when we're awake.
1524.713 We know that sleep is
so vital for resetting.
1527.06 You're waking up early, you
can't get back to sleep.
1529.14 That's going to adjust your affect,
1532.88 your emotions in negative ways.
1534.39 We know this.
1535.57 And appetite is off.
1536.96 And there are hormones that get disrupted.
1539.52 So cortisol levels are increased.
1541.68 In particular, there's a
signature pattern of depression
1544.65 whereby cortisol, the
stress hormone that normally
1548.09 is released in a healthy way
1549.76 only in the early part of the day
1551.94 is shifted to late in the day.
1554.77 In fact, a 9:00 PM peak in cortisol
1557.55 is one of the physiological signatures
1561.04 of depressive like states.
1562.86 It's not the only one, but
it is an important one.
1566.49 So there are a lot of things
going on in major depression.
1568.56 And by now you're probably thinking,
1570.04 goodness, this is dreadful.
1571.23 Like there's all this terrible stuff.
1572.55 And indeed it is terrible.
1574.52 It is a terrible thing to find oneself
1577.46 in a mode where things
feel sad, you feel guilty,
1580.7 you're exhausted.
1582.09 And oftentimes there's also an association
1584.53 with the anxiety system.
1586.66 So just because people are exhausted
1588.42 and lethargic and they don't enjoy things,
1590.34 doesn't necessarily mean that
there's an absence of anxiety.
1593.36 There can also be a lot of anxiety
1594.69 about what's going to happen to me.
1595.96 Am I going to be able to
achieve my goals in life?
1598.16 Will I ever get out of this state?
1600.57 And so things really start to layer on.
1602.47 And if this sounds depressing to you,
1604.62 it is indeed depressing.
1606.41 This is really the place that
many people find themselves.
1609.76 And it's a pit that they just don't know
1611.56 how to climb out of.
1612.98 So let's just take a few minutes
1614.75 and talk about some of
the underlying biology
1617.42 that creates this cloud
or this constellation
1621.32 of symptomology.
1622.99 I think that's really important to do
1624.43 because if we want to understand
the various treatments,
1628.22 how they work and why they
work and how to implement them,
1630.71 we have to understand some
of the underlying biology.
1633.29 So let's spend a few minutes
1634.3 talking about the biology of depression,
1636.79 what's known and what's not known.
1638.52 Because in doing that,
1639.84 I think you'll get a much clearer picture
1641.91 about why certain tools
work to relieve depression
1645.06 and why others might not.
1647.88 So one of the most
important early findings
1651.09 in the search for a
biological basis of depression
1655.23 was this finding that there are drugs
1658.0 that relieve some of the
symptoms of depression.
1662.0 Those drugs generally fall
into three major categories,
1665.56 but the first set of
ones that were discovered
1668.37 were the so-called
tricyclic antidepressants,
1671.83 and the MAO inhibitors, the
monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
1677.17 You don't need to understand
that nomenclature,
1679.08 but I'm going to give you
a little bit of detail
1680.63 so that if you want to
understand it, you can.
1683.53 Most of this work took
place in the late 1950s
1686.8 and in the 1960s, and
continued well until the 1980s
1691.36 when new classes of drugs were discovered.
1693.92 And these tricyclic antidepressants
and the MAO inhibitors
1698.79 largely worked by increasing
levels of norepinephrine
1703.49 in the brain, as well as
in the body, in some cases.
1707.14 And they were discovered
1708.48 through a kind of odd
set of circumstances.
1710.35 We don't have time to
go into all the history,
1711.86 but suffice to say that
they were discovered
1714.17 because of the exploration for drugs
1716.8 that alter blood pressure.
1719.37 Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure,
1721.96 and drugs that lower blood pressure
1725.23 reduce levels of norepinephrine.
1727.46 And that in many cases, was
shown to lead to depression
1731.32 or depressive like symptoms.
1733.37 And so these drugs, these tricyclic drugs,
1735.75 and the MAO inhibitors actually
increase norepinephrine.
1739.79 And frankly, they do quite a
good job of relieving some,
1743.82 if not all of the symptoms
of major depression.
1747.42 However, they carry with
the many side effects.
1750.21 Some of those side
effects are side effects
1752.58 related to blood pressure itself,
1753.99 by increasing noradrenaline,
norepinephrine as it's called,
1757.64 you raise blood pressure.
1758.74 That can be dangerous,
that can be uncomfortable.
1761.63 But they also have a lot
of other side effects.
1765.03 The reason they have other side effects
1766.71 is because they impact systems
in the brain and in the body
1770.22 that impact things like
libido, appetite, digestion,
1775.07 and others.
1775.903 And we'll talk about each
of those in sequence.
1778.32 Okay, so the experience
that clinicians had
1781.19 of observing some relief for depression
1784.19 with the tricyclic antidepressants
and with MAO inhibitors
1788.19 was terrific, but there
were all these side effects,
1790.45 side effects that people
really did not like,
1792.5 they didn't like these drugs at all.
1794.562 A lot of people get dry mouth,
I mentioned the low libido,
1797.17 they'd have sleep issues,
appetite issues, weight gain.
1800.05 They made some people so uncomfortable
1801.51 that they preferred not to take them,
1803.02 even though when they didn't take them,
1804.87 they had a worsening or a maintenance
1806.76 of their depressive symptoms.
1810.32 A decade or so later,
there was the discovery
1812.9 of the so-called pleasure
pathways in the brain.
1815.54 These are pathways,
literally groups of neurons
1818.43 that reside in different
locations in the brain
1820.56 but connect to one another.
1821.63 So it's a circuit.
1822.93 And when you stimulate these
neurons with certain behaviors
1827.97 or with electrical
stimulation in an experiment,
1830.7 believe it or not,
1831.533 that's been done in
both animals and humans,
1833.66 animals and humans become
very, very motivated
1836.72 to get more stimulation of these pathways.
1839.7 So this pleasure pathway or
these circuits for pleasure
1843.44 are very what we call reinforcing.
1847.02 In fact, animals and humans will work hard
1851.65 to get stimulation of these brain areas
1854.06 even more than they will
work to obtain sex, drugs,
1858.64 or even if they are addicted
to a particular drug
1861.26 and they are in a state of withdrawal,
1862.9 the ultimate state of craving,
1865.17 if given a choice, a person or an animal
1867.88 will select to have stimulation
of this pleasure pathway
1871.93 instead of the drug itself.
1874.11 And that is a major and
significant finding.
1877.11 This pleasure pathway,
as it's sometimes called,
1879.87 involves areas like the nucleus accumbens
1882.11 and the ventral tegmental area.
1883.98 These are areas of the brain
1885.38 that are rich with neurons
that make dopamine.
1888.55 And if you think to the
symptoms of depression,
1890.94 of anhedonia, lack of pleasure,
1892.8 a lack of ability to experience pleasure,
1895.38 well, that was a smoking gun
that there's something wrong
1899.47 with the dopamine pathway in depression.
1902.33 And indeed that's the case.
1903.29 So it's not just norepinephrine,
1904.67 it's also the dopamine or pleasure pathway
1907.01 is somehow disrupted.
1908.69 And then in the 1980s,
1910.39 there was the discovery
of the so-called SSRIs
1913.02 Most people are now
familiar with the SSRIs,
1915.28 the Selective Serotonin
Re-Uptake Inhibitors.
1918.44 The SSRIs worked by distinct mechanisms
1922.02 from the tricyclic antidepressants
and the MAO inhibitors.
1926.09 As their name suggests, SSRI,
1928.21 Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors
1931.05 prevent serotonin from being
wiped up from the synapse
1936.45 after two neurons talk to one another.
1938.37 What do I mean by that?
1939.24 Well, here's some very
basic Neurobiology 101.
1941.96 If you don't know any neurobiology,
1943.61 you're going to know
some in about 15 seconds.
1946.51 Neurons communicate with one another
1948.58 by spitting out chemicals into
the little gap between them.
1952.56 The little gap between
them is called the synapse
1954.74 or by the Brits, the synapse.
1957.36 Those chemicals bind to the
neuron on the opposite side
1960.9 and cause changes in the
electrical activity of that neuron
1964.02 on the other side of the synapse.
1966.33 Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter
1969.07 or more specifically,
it's a neuromodulator,
1971.75 can change the activity
of large groups of neurons
1974.55 in very meaningful ways.
1975.94 Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
1978.46 means when a person takes this drug,
1982.09 some of those drugs include
things like Prozac or Zoloft,
1985.2 the more typical names
or more generic names
1987.34 are things like fluoxetine,
1989.14 when people take those,
more serotonin hangs out
1992.7 in the synapse and is able to be taken up
1995.13 by the neuron on the opposite side
1997.6 because of this selective
re-uptake inhibition.
2002.36 It prevents the clearance of
serotonin from the synapse
2006.74 and thereby more serotonin
can have an effect.
2009.56 So SSRIs don't increase the
total amount of serotonin
2013.28 in the brain.
2014.22 They change how effective the serotonin
2017.96 that's already in the brain is
2020.06 at changing the activity of neurons, okay?
2023.9 So they don't increase serotonin,
2025.81 they increase the efficacy
or the function of serotonin
2029.61 in the way that I just described.
2031.59 So that was more than 15 seconds,
2033.04 but now you understand how SSRIs work.
2035.9 And I wouldn't be talking about SSRIs
2038.22 if they didn't in fact work.
2041.29 Yes, there are many problems with SSRIs.
2043.85 They do carry certain side
effects in many individuals.
2046.96 Also, about a third of
people that take SSRIs
2051.27 don't derive any benefit,
2053.07 it doesn't relieve their
symptoms of depression.
2055.35 However, for the other two thirds,
2057.11 there's often a relief of some,
2058.89 if not all of the symptoms
of major depression.
2061.52 The problem is the side effects
that accompany those SSRIs.
2065.54 And so these days SSRIs
are a complicated topic.
2068.78 It's sort of what I would
call a barbed wire topic
2070.82 because we often hear about
all the problems with them,
2073.91 but these drugs also have
saved a lot of lives.
2076.33 They've also improved a lot of lives.
2079.32 The issue is that they tend
to have varying effects
2082.69 on different individuals,
2083.62 and sometimes varying effects over time.
2085.86 So they'll work for awhile then
they won't work for a while.
2088.36 There are also a lot of
mysteries about the SSRIs,
2091.387 and those mysteries bother people.
2093.75 What mysteries am I referring to?
2095.13 Well, SSRIs increase
the amount of serotonin
2099.36 or more specifically,
they increase the efficacy
2102.12 of serotonin at the synapse,
that happens immediately,
2105.9 or very soon after people
start taking SSRIs.
2109.01 But people generally don't
start experiencing any relief
2111.75 from their symptoms of depression
2113.33 if they're going to
experience them at all,
2116.07 until about two weeks after
they start taking these drugs.
2119.03 So there's something going
on there that's not clear.
2121.42 One idea is that the SSRIs
actually can improve symptoms
2126.22 of depression or even remove
symptoms of depression
2130.37 through so-called neuro-plasticity
2132.87 by changing the way that
neural circuits function.
2135.93 And there are many on this,
2137.84 but the main categories
of studies on SSRIs
2140.24 that relate to neuroplasticity
fall into two camps.
2143.05 One is that the ways in which SSRIs might,
2146.43 and I want to emphasize,
might be able to trigger
2148.61 the production of more
neurons in the brain,
2150.75 in particular areas of the hippocampus
2153.24 called the dentate gyrus and
others, that impact memory.
2157.52 This is important. We're
going to come back to memory.
2159.51 The other is that the
SSRIs have been shown
2162.56 in various scientific studies to reopen
2166.86 critical periods of plasticity.
2168.52 I'll just briefly describe
one of those studies.
2170.12 There was a study done by
Lamberto Maffei's group in Pisa,
2174.43 that explored brain plasticity
2176.84 that's known to be
present in young animals
2179.0 and disappear in older animals.
2181.47 And this is also true in
humans that younger humans
2184.55 have a far more plastic
brain that can change
2186.58 in many more ways more easily
than can the older brain.
2190.21 And what they showed was
that fluoxetine, Prozac,
2193.4 given to adult animals can reopen
2197.63 this incredible period of plasticity,
2199.92 can allow more plasticity to occur.
2202.67 That was interesting.
2203.503 I mean, it's purely through increases
2204.87 in serotonin transmission.
2206.93 And there are other studies
showing that fluoxetine
2209.6 can increase the number of new neurons
2211.04 that are born into the adult brain,
2212.86 so called neurogenesis, the
production of new neurons.
2216.36 So it's very clear that there are at least
2219.41 three major chemical systems in the brain;
2221.75 norepinephrine, dopamine,
and serotonin that relate to
2225.86 and can adjust the symptoms of depression.
2229.02 And those actually can be
divided into separate categories.
2232.16 So for instance, epinephrin
or norepinephrine
2235.97 is thought to relate to the
so-called psychomotor defects,
2239.37 sometimes called psychomotor retardation.
2241.41 This is the lethargy,
this is the exhaustion,
2244.08 this is the inability to get
out of bed in the morning.
2246.79 Dopamine is thought to
relate to the anhedonia,
2250.35 or I should say lack of
dopamine in depressive patients
2253.74 is thought to lead to the anhedonia.
2255.96 The lack of ability to
experience pleasure.
2259.42 And serotonin is thought to
relate to the grief, the guilt,
2264.43 some of the more cognitive
or more emotional aspects
2268.07 of depression.
2269.19 So we've got the norepinephrine system
2270.8 related to activity and alertness,
2272.97 the dopamine system
relating to motivation,
2275.46 pleasure, and the ability to
seek and experience pleasure,
2278.61 and then the serotonin system
that's related to grief.
2282.38 And unfortunately, brains and organisms
2284.87 don't work in a simple mathematical way
2287.93 where you just say, oh, well,
2288.89 this person's experiencing a lot of grief,
2290.8 but they don't have any
problems with lethargy.
2294.49 And so let's just boost
up their serotonin.
2296.34 On paper it works,
2297.34 but oftentimes it doesn't work clinically.
2299.63 And another patient,
you might get somebody
2301.99 who can't experience pleasure,
but they're kind of anxious.
2304.57 They don't have any trouble sleeping,
2306.157 but they're just much more
anxious and frustrated
2310.21 than they normally are,
2311.17 and they meet the symptoms of depression.
2313.28 Well, you might think, oh, well,
2314.87 do you just give that person
some drugs increase dopamine
2317.83 and everything will be better?
2318.8 And indeed, in some cases that's true.
2320.78 There are drugs like Wellbutrin,
2323.15 which function more specifically
on the dopamine system
2326.69 to increase dopamine and they
also increase norepinephrine.
2329.5 Many people get great relief
from things like Wellbutrin.
2333.58 They don't really impact the
serotonin system so much.
2336.5 And therefore you don't get
a lot of the serotonergic
2338.9 or serotonin related side effects.
2340.96 However, some people feel far
too anxious on those drugs,
2344.49 some people get addicted
to those drugs in a way,
2347.45 because a lot of those
drugs that increase dopamine
2349.85 make you want more of those drugs.
2351.67 So you start to realize that
what makes sense on paper
2353.94 doesn't always make sense clinically.
2355.35 And this is why it's complicated.
2356.52 And a really good psychologist
2358.1 and a really good psychiatrist
will work with someone
2359.87 to try and pull and push
on these various systems
2362.44 to find the combination
of drugs that may be
2365.24 or may not be correct for them.
2368.0 There's a fourth aspect of
the chemistry of depression
2371.21 that's really important to understand.
2372.55 And that's pain.
2374.53 We've talked about pain
on this podcast before,
2376.51 but even if you didn't hear
the episode on pleasure
2378.43 and pain, just want to
emphasize that pain is something
2381.12 that we experience in our
body, no surprise there,
2383.26 an injury, a cut, et cetera,
2385.14 but that we also
experience emotional pain.
2387.32 And those systems are linked
in very intricate ways.
2391.62 There's actually some data
showing that pain relievers,
2395.15 Tylenol, Aspirin, these sorts of things,
2396.92 can help certain people
with emotional pain.
2399.727 Now I'm not recommending people run out
2401.4 and take those things for emotional pain.
2403.23 But actually, if you think about it,
2404.19 that shouldn't come as any surprise.
2405.67 given the enormous number of
people that take painkillers,
2409.08 opioids and things like
them to try and relieve
2411.18 their psychological pain.
2412.27 And as we know, those drugs
are very, very problematic
2416.43 for many individuals.
2418.13 They can help certain individuals,
2419.37 but they are very prone to abuse
2421.76 and they can induce addiction very easily
2424.06 in a number of people.
2425.35 There's a substance that's
literally called substance P,
2429.5 the letter P, that's manufactured
by neurons in our brain
2433.35 and body, which underlies
our sensation of pain.
2435.41 And indeed substance P
inhibitors have been used
2438.82 to treat depression,
and in some cases works.
2441.41 A lot of people with depression
are hypersensitive to pain,
2445.06 and of course they could have
multiple things going on.
2446.91 They could have chronic
pain or chronic injury
2448.9 and major depression.
2450.36 So you start to get the constellation
2451.76 of the many things that could happen.
2453.91 So that's all I want to say
today about the chemistry
2457.53 underlying depression or major depression.
2461.19 There's a lot more there,
2462.2 but I think if you understand
the norepinephrine system
2464.79 and that it relates to some
of these things like lethargy,
2468.61 the psychomotor defects,
as they're called,
2471.43 dopamine and how it relates to motivation
2474.01 and lack of motivation and lack
of dopamine and depression,
2477.01 and serotonin and its
relationship to grief,
2480.34 and that low serotonin can
lead to extreme grief and shame
2483.52 and higher serotonin levels
can sometimes restore
2486.02 a sense of wellbeing and safety
2487.93 and feeling good about oneself.
2489.71 If you understand that and you
understand that physical pain
2492.71 is somehow involved in certain cases,
2494.45 I think you will know
more about depression
2497.107 and its underlying chemistry
than most all people out there.
2499.86 And if you'd like to learn more,
2500.86 I invite you to pursue
searching those terms
2504.2 further on the internet.
2505.4 And we'll certainly go
into them in more depth.
2507.12 But that really sets the stage
for where we're headed next.
2510.17 So next I'd like to talk about hormones
2511.82 and how they relate to depression.
2513.97 And I'd also like to talk about stress
2515.77 and how it relates to depression,
2517.44 as well as talk about some of the genetics
2519.5 or the predispositions to depression.
2522.78 And for those of you that are thinking,
2523.97 hey, I want the tools.
2524.89 I want to know how to fix depression.
2527.11 I understand the desire for that.
2529.77 I will just ask if you
hang in here with me
2531.8 a little bit longer, not only
will you learn a lot more
2534.07 about how this complicated
mood disorder works,
2538.03 some of the more
interesting things about it,
2540.28 but it will also position
you to get a lot more
2542.47 out of the tools that we will describe.
2544.53 You always have the option
to skip forward of course,
2546.45 but I think it's important to understand
2548.33 some of the hormonal and stress-related
2549.96 aspects of depression.
2551.58 So let's talk about hormones.
2554.53 20% of people that have major depression
2557.23 have low thyroid hormone.
2559.37 Thyroid hormone is related to metabolism.
2561.663 Oftentimes we think about
thyroid is only related
2564.5 to having a fast metabolism,
2567.29 but thyroid is related to
all forms of metabolism,
2570.37 including our ability to
synthesize new tissues
2572.84 like protein and repair injuries.
2575.47 I did a whole episode on
thyroid and growth hormone.
2578.5 If you want to check that out,
2579.53 all of that is archived
at hubermanlab.com.
2582.36 It's all timestamped, et cetera.
2583.74 You can find on YouTube, Apple,
Spotify, all those places.
2586.37 So if you're curious about thyroid hormone
2587.93 and growth hormone, and you want
to do the deep dive on those,
2590.7 and you want to learn
how to alter their levels
2593.04 using various approaches, check that out.
2595.68 But 20% of people with major
depression are hypo thyroidal.
2600.38 They don't make enough thyroid.
2602.29 And that leads to low energy,
2604.28 low metabolism in the brain and body.
2607.35 And there's a condition
called Hashimoto's,
2610.1 which is essentially low thyroid output.
2613.56 And again, I don't want
to get into all the tools
2615.34 related to thyroid.
2616.173 Sometimes a psychiatrists will
prescribe thyroid medication
2620.01 to increase thyroid output
in people that are depressed
2622.53 and that will work to
relieve the symptoms.
2624.56 So there isn't necessarily
a direct problem
2626.94 with serotonin, dopamine,
and norepinephrine
2629.06 or substance abuse.
2629.893 Sometimes it's a thyroid problem.
2631.67 So there are certain
situations or conditions
2634.18 that can impact the thyroid hormone system
2637.17 and make people more
susceptible to depression
2639.7 or make a pre-existing depression worse.
2642.04 And those are things like childbirth.
2644.4 So it's well-known that
women who give birth
2646.81 can often undergo what's
called postpartum depression.
2649.46 It actually comes from the word
post parturition depression.
2653.81 They give birth,
2655.202 what's happier, what's
more joyful than the birth
2657.98 of a new healthy child,
2659.37 and they will lapse into a depression.
2660.94 And that's thought to
be hormonally related,
2663.4 either directly to the thyroid system
2665.99 or perhaps to the cortisol system as well.
2667.8 We'll talk about cortisol in a moment.
2669.49 As well, certain women
during certain phases
2671.99 of their menstrual cycle
experience symptoms
2674.98 that are very much like
clinical depression,
2677.8 and oftentimes are diagnosed
2679.79 with clinical depression appropriately.
2682.14 And of course the menstrual
cycle is associated
2683.75 with shifts in hormone levels.
2685.08 As well, menopausal and
post-menopausal women
2688.67 are more susceptible to major depression,
2691.52 regardless of whether or not they've had
2692.81 that major depression
earlier in their life.
2694.43 So these are things to
be on the lookout for
2696.22 and to definitely talk to a
doctor and get a blood panel
2699.21 that hopefully includes
measures of thyroid hormone
2701.75 and cortisol hormone.
2702.71 Why cortisol hormone?
2703.84 Well more stress is
correlated with more bouts
2707.27 of major depression across the lifespan.
2709.84 How many bouts?
2710.72 Well, it turns out that as you go
2713.53 from having one to two to three,
2715.34 well, when you hit four to five bouts
2717.65 of really intense,
stressful episodes in life,
2720.75 these tend to be long-term
stressful episodes,
2723.31 your risk for major
depression goes way up.
2726.34 So whether or not you have
a genetic predisposition
2728.88 to depression or not,
2731.08 one of the best things you can do
2733.02 to try and avoid getting depressed
2734.54 is to learn to control your stress system,
2737.52 to not go from short-term stress,
2739.91 which everybody experiences,
2741.19 we all have short-term stressors,
2743.28 to medium term stress to long-term stress,
2745.44 and to not have too many
bouts of long-term stress
2747.82 because that probability
of getting depressed
2750.21 goes way, way up.
2751.43 And this is something I've
seen over and over again,
2754.4 not just in my scientific
career, but just throughout life.
2756.93 People in all sorts of
domains, young and old,
2759.56 I've seen that people will go through
2761.47 a very intense relationship, a breakup,
2765.51 sometimes it's the staying
together that stressful,
2767.51 sometimes it's a graduate
school that can be stressful,
2770.92 sometimes it's some other event.
2772.9 And then some months later
they become depressed.
2775.6 And that's because the stress system
2777.26 is associated with the
release of cortisol.
2779.29 The cortisol system
can dramatically impact
2781.507 the way that these
different neuromodulators,
2783.93 dopamine, norepinephrine
and serotonin function.
2786.27 And so there's this kind of
latent or longer lasting impact
2790.47 on the systems that
impact mood and wellbeing.
2794.0 So learning how to control
your stress is really key.
2796.44 If you're not depressed or you're somebody
2798.96 that has not lapsed into
a depression recently,
2802.05 take control of your stress system.
2803.71 And we did an entire episode
on how to conquer stress,
2806.6 and that involves dealing
with stress in the short term,
2808.92 the medium term, and in the long-term.
2810.48 And there are a lot of
different ways to do that.
2812.65 One of the more important reasons
2814.64 for learning how to counter stress
2816.19 in order to offset depression
2819.03 is that there is a genetic predisposition
2821.97 that certain people carry
to become depressed.
2824.57 There are these studies now
2826.18 of many, many thousands of individuals,
2828.29 these were mainly done in New Zealand,
2829.91 but these studies have
now been done elsewhere,
2832.19 looking at many tens of
thousands of individuals
2835.51 who carry particular copies of genes,
2838.73 what they call polymorphisms,
2840.6 in particular of a gene called 5HTTLPR,
2845.04 which is a serotonin transporter.
2847.37 So this is a gene that
controls or regulates
2849.91 how much serotonin is
available in the brain.
2852.67 If you have this gene, this polymorphism,
2856.12 it doesn't necessarily mean
that you will be depressed,
2858.49 but it greatly shifts your
susceptibility to depression
2863.34 under conditions of stress.
2865.23 So I realize some people
are listening to this
2867.027 and some people are
watching it on YouTube.
2868.7 So I'm going to describe this in a way
2869.89 that doesn't require
looking at any graphs.
2872.01 What I want you to imagine
is a very, shallow hill,
2876.77 like a very mellow hill.
2878.14 It's just a ramp set at
about 10 or 15 degrees, okay.
2882.72 What we're plotting there in your mind
2884.68 is that with each about of serious stress,
2889.95 so that could be trying to finish a degree
2891.57 or a relationship breakup, or
a family member that's sick,
2895.02 or the loss of a loved one or a pet,
2896.77 with each about of stress, the probability
2899.81 that you will experience a
major depression goes up.
2903.1 However, if you carry this
gene, this HTTLPR gene,
2909.87 the steepness of that
curve goes way, way up
2913.41 where it's actually more like a line
2915.08 such that you need far
fewer bouts of stress
2919.52 in order to lapse into a
major depression, okay?
2922.42 So if the typical person who
doesn't carry this polymorphism
2926.05 has to experience two or
three or four or five bouts
2928.87 of stress before they
lapse into a depression,
2931.97 somebody with this gene is
susceptible to getting depression
2935.48 after just one about or two
bouts of intense stress, okay?
2939.24 So that's how these genes work.
2941.2 They don't preordain or
determine you to be depressed.
2945.84 They raise a susceptibility.
2947.47 And many genes,
2949.07 many things related to
heritability in general,
2951.63 work in that way.
2953.14 And we know there's a
strong genetic component
2955.36 to depression.
2956.193 How do we know?
2957.026 Well, in what are called
concordant monozygotic twins.
2961.1 So these will be identical twins.
2963.63 And they can either be
in one biological sack
2966.81 or two biological sacks while in utero,
2970.1 what's called monochorionic
or dichorionic.
2972.84 Well, typically it's monochorionic.
2975.65 And identical twins, for
which one of those twins
2979.59 goes on to have major depression,
2981.07 there's a 50% probability
that the other one
2983.47 will have major depression.
2984.63 So it's not 100%, it's not 100% inherited,
2988.18 it's not 100% generic, as you might say,
2990.91 but there's a much higher
predisposition for depression.
2995.7 Whereas in fraternal
twins, that number drops,
2999.55 and in siblings, that
number drops to about 25%,
3002.66 and in half siblings, it's about 10%.
3005.41 The numbers vary from study to study,
3007.15 but basically the more
closely related you are
3009.26 to somebody who has major
depression, the more likely it is
3013.08 that you will also get major depression.
3014.55 And therefore, if you haven't
gotten major depression,
3017.14 the more likely it is
that you should take steps
3020.64 to learn to mitigate stress
3022.69 because stress is the major factor
3024.17 that can trigger one of
these depressive episodes.
3027.36 So we've covered a lot
related to the stress
3032.61 and the hormones and the
neurochemistry of depression.
3035.88 In fact, I think this is probably
the deepest I've ever gone
3038.18 into the biology of any
topic on this podcast
3040.99 before getting to any specific tools.
3043.73 I mentioned that learning
how to mitigate stress
3045.67 and deal with stress,
3046.503 learning how to measure and
adjust your thyroid hormone,
3049.25 those might be useful.
3050.5 But next I'd like to turn
to some very specific tools
3053.83 that people who both have depression
3057.15 or who are prone to depression,
3058.61 as well as people who
don't have depression
3060.07 and simply want to maintain a good mood,
3062.58 who want to maintain a positive affect
3064.36 and pursuit of things in life,
3065.93 what are the things that you can do?
3067.37 It turns out there are
things that you can do
3069.007 and all of the biology that underlies
3071.93 the utility of those things.
3074.21 Meaning the reasons those things work
3076.46 will now make sense to you
because they adjust things
3079.1 like serotonin and dopamine,
3080.67 and they adjust them through
very specific pathways.
3084.22 I know for many people
learning about mechanism
3086.9 is kind of grueling.
3087.81 I realized this podcast
isn't necessarily one
3089.88 that you can listen to passively
while doing other things.
3092.33 Although I would hope
that you could do that
3094.8 and still enjoy it and
extract the information.
3097.27 Why mechanism?
3098.21 Mechanism is so key
3099.98 because mechanism is a
little bit like understanding
3102.95 some of the chemistry of cooking.
3105.48 If you read a recipe and
you can follow a recipe,
3108.87 you often hear people say,
oh, I can follow a recipe.
3112.48 That means that if you have
every ingredient in that recipe,
3115.47 you're good.
3116.303 You likely can make that
dish. You can make that meal.
3119.75 However, if you understand a
little bit of the chemistry
3122.36 of why salt has to be
added third and not first,
3126.86 or why the heat has to be
adjusted at a particular time,
3129.85 well then not only can
you follow a recipe,
3132.18 but that also gives you flexibility
3133.71 for when salt isn't available,
3135.6 or when you want to adjust
the flavor of the dish,
3138.4 or when you want to try a new dish,
3140.5 or you want to get experimental.
3141.69 So when you understand mechanism,
3143.14 it puts you in a tremendous place of power
3145.83 to work with your system.
3147.54 So it's not just plug and chug,
3148.91 like take 12 milligrams of this,
3151.71 you either feel better or you don't.
3153.31 You can really start to
understand how prescription drugs,
3157.1 supplements, nutrition, behavioral tools,
3161.53 how those things weave
together to either work for you
3163.83 or not work for you and get you to paths
3166.37 of healthy mind and body.
3169.22 So let's think about
why any tool would work
3172.02 to relieve depression.
3173.56 We've talked about how some of the drugs
3174.94 that impact these different
chemical systems might work
3177.3 and why they create some of
the problems they create.
3180.26 Problems are mainly created
by the fact that they impact
3182.94 lots of systems in the brain and body.
3184.55 So you take a drug to increase serotonin,
3186.88 but that serotonin is also
related, not just to mood,
3190.27 but to things related
to libido and appetite.
3192.51 And so you start disrupting
multiple systems.
3196.31 The same could be said for
behavioral tools, right?
3199.0 That any behavioral tool
that adjusts the levels
3202.22 of a particular chemical ought to perhaps,
3205.53 provide some relief for
some of the symptoms
3207.31 of major depression.
3208.75 Let's take an example that
I've talked about before
3211.62 on the podcast, which is,
3212.69 if you get into a very cold
shower, you take an ice bath,
3215.67 you will release
norepinephrine and epinephrine
3218.12 in your brain and body.
3218.953 There's no question about that.
3220.95 I don't think anyone
can really escape that.
3223.07 It's a kind of a universal
response to being in cold water.
3226.72 Well, if some aspects of depression
3229.73 are related to low
levels of norepinephrine,
3232.37 will taking cold showers
relieve your depression?
3235.7 Perhaps it might even
relieve certain aspects
3238.01 of that depression.
3238.96 Is it a cure? Well, that's going
to depend on the individual.
3243.0 Will exercise help?
3244.02 Well, if you go out for a run,
3245.72 you're going to increase
the amount of norepinephrine
3247.95 in your body.
3249.11 If you enjoy that run, it's
likely that you'll increase
3252.41 the levels of dopamine
and probably serotonin
3255.16 in your brain and body as well.
3256.88 Will that cure your depression?
3258.03 Well, there are a lot of studies exploring
3260.22 how exercise can impact depression.
3262.06 And indeed, regular
exercise is known to be
3264.98 a protective behavior against depression,
3269.35 but it also can help relieve
3270.51 some of the symptoms of depression.
3272.52 So you may ask yourself, why
would you need drugs at all?
3275.45 Why would there be prescription drugs
3277.55 or the need for
supplementation or other things
3279.61 to alleviate the symptoms of depression?
3281.65 Ah, well, that's the diabolical
nature of depression,
3284.93 which is if people are far
enough along in this thing,
3289.91 this sometimes called disease,
sometimes called disorder,
3292.53 but major depression, oftentimes
they can't get the energy
3297.67 to even get up and take
a bath or a shower.
3300.85 They have no motivation to do it,
3303.14 they have no desire to go for a run.
3305.2 So you say, "Come on, let's
go, you'll feel better.
3306.847 "I know you feel better, it
generates all these chemicals
3308.887 "I heard on the whatever
podcast, Huberman Lab podcast,
3311.967 "or another podcast
that getting into action
3314.197 "does all these things."
3315.42 And they just don't want to do it.
3316.69 And to you, a person who's
not experiencing depression,
3320.21 that perhaps could just seem
like the most frustrating
3322.07 and confusing thing in the world.
3323.7 But it's very important to highlight
3325.17 the fact that these circuits
3326.9 that are accessible to some of us,
3329.09 the circuits for happiness,
for pursuit of pleasure,
3331.72 for exercise, for
getting in a cold shower,
3336.41 if that's your thing,
3337.62 that those circuits are
present in all people,
3340.99 but for certain people
3342.57 that are experiencing major depression
3344.486 and are really in the
depths of their depression,
3347.01 they can't really access
those circuits in the same way
3350.65 that people who are not
suffering from depression can.
3354.21 So I hope that makes it clear.
3355.23 It's not offering any excuses for them.
3357.4 And indeed, I think those
behaviors would help
3360.47 jolt them out of some of the
symptomology of depression,
3364.42 but they're just not
accessible to everybody.
3367.25 So let's talk about the
things that people can do
3370.75 to deal with depression.
3372.22 And again, anytime you add a behavior
3375.1 or a tool or a supplement,
3376.99 or subtract a behavior, tool,
supplement, drug, et cetera,
3379.96 you absolutely should
talk to your physician,
3381.72 especially if you're somebody
3383.14 that's dealing with major depression.
3385.22 I want to focus on the stress system.
3387.89 And I'm not just going to tell you
3389.86 to get sunlight in your eyes
3391.21 and to get a good night's sleep,
3392.44 although I think everybody should do that
3393.98 on a regular basis, ideally every day,
3396.68 talked about those ad
nauseum on this podcast.
3399.0 They will help your sleep,
3400.2 they will help you alleviate stress.
3401.71 I think you should have
tools to deal with stress
3403.36 in real time, et cetera.
3405.14 But let's look at depression
from the standpoint
3407.38 of a deeper biological phenomenon,
3409.48 which is inflammation
and the immune system.
3412.54 There's growing evidence now
3414.41 that many forms of major depression,
3416.5 if not all of them, relate
to excessive inflammation.
3421.58 Now inflammation plays an
important role in wound healing.
3424.13 It is a positive aspect
of our immune system.
3427.62 Our ability to combat wounds,
combat illnesses, et cetera,
3433.24 but inflammation gone unchecked,
3435.68 inflammation that lasts too long,
3437.24 or is of too high amplitude,
3439.17 meaning too many anti-inflammatory
3441.45 or inflammatory cytokines
and things of that sort
3444.1 in the body is bad.
3445.97 And there's decent evidence
now that inflammation
3449.58 can lead to or exacerbate depression.
3452.38 And that if we want to control depression,
3454.42 or limit or eliminate depression,
3456.78 that focusing on reducing inflammation
3460.23 and its associated pathways
is a really good thing to do.
3462.88 And I think this is a really
good thing for everybody to do
3465.98 regardless of whether or not
you suffer from depression
3468.22 or not.
3469.053 And today we're going to talk
about exactly how depression
3472.18 comes about through the
inflammation pathway.
3475.61 So, first of all, who
are the major players
3479.38 in creating chronic inflammation
in the brain and body?
3482.67 They are the inflammatory cytokines.
3485.03 Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
3487.47 things like Tumor
Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha,
3491.72 things like C reactive protein, alright?
3495.38 Not all of these are cytokines.
3496.687 You have interferons and prostoglandins
3499.28 and a lot of these things.
3500.64 But when we are stressed,
chronically stressed,
3503.64 we get inflamed, our brain
and various locations
3506.47 of the brain become inflamed
because certain classes
3508.78 of cells, in particular,
those glial cells,
3511.42 the cells that are typically thought
3513.18 to just be support cells,
3514.63 those cells and their biochemistry
3516.51 and their dialogue with the neurons
3518.02 of the brain and body
starts to become disrupted.
3522.12 I may have mentioned it
earlier, I don't recall.
3524.14 But I certainly mentioned
it in an earlier podcast
3526.57 that adrenaline epinephrin,
when it's released in the body,
3530.27 it doesn't cross the blood brain barrier,
3531.91 but there are certain things
3533.51 that are able to cross
the blood-brain barrier
3536.27 when we are stressed.
3537.103 Things like the E2 prostoglandins,
3539.02 those cross the blood brain barrier.
3541.14 And our blood and our brain,
3543.56 therefore our brain and
our body can communicate
3546.2 because certain things can
pass through this barrier
3549.43 we call the BBB or the
Blood Brain Barrier.
3551.28 And also we have something
called the glymphatic system,
3553.44 which is really a plumbing system
3554.74 that links the brain and body.
3555.88 It's the link between the
immune system and the brain.
3559.57 Well, there is a set of
actions that we can take
3563.99 in order to limit inflammation.
3566.45 And this has been shown
3567.64 in several quality peer
reviewed studies now
3570.48 to reduce inflammation
and to relieve some,
3574.65 and in some cases, all of the
symptoms of major depression.
3577.75 One of those approaches
is to increase our intake
3581.68 of so-called EPAs or
Essential Fatty Acids.
3585.36 There's now a very long list of papers
3589.24 in quality peer review journals
3590.76 showing that when people ingest
3593.69 a certain level of EPA
omega-3 fatty acids,
3598.82 the relief from depressive
symptoms matches the SSRIs.
3604.52 That's incredible, right?
3605.93 That essential fatty acids
3607.41 could relieve symptoms of depression,
3608.86 as well as some of the
prescription antidepressants.
3611.82 Now, this doesn't
necessarily mean you run off
3613.91 and stop taking your antidepressants
3615.7 if you've been prescribed
them, please don't do that.
3617.42 Please talk to your physician.
3618.7 And I should mention that
some of the same studies
3622.53 have shown that increasing our intake
3624.6 of these essential fatty acids,
3626.01 in particular, the EPA
variety of omega-3s,
3630.87 can lower the effective
dose of things like SSRIs.
3635.72 Meaning if we required a 50
milligram or 40 milligram dose
3639.3 of fluoxetine, that one
can get by on a lower dose
3642.87 and thereby perhaps not experience as many
3646.39 or as severe side effects
3647.93 by taking or supplementing with EPAs.
3651.27 Now, the threshold level
seems to be about one gram,
3655.01 1000 milligrams of EPA.
3657.18 So you will sometimes see
on a bottle of krill oil
3660.36 or fish oil or any other
source, even plant source
3664.01 or other source of EPA
that it's 1000 milligrams
3668.87 or 1200 milligrams.
3670.4 But what's really important to look at
3672.17 is whether or not there's more
than 1000 milligrams of EPA,
3676.83 because the EPA in particular
is what's important here.
3679.34 And actually in exploring
some of the literature
3682.31 on the effects of EPAs on
cardiovascular health, excuse me,
3686.15 as well as their effects on depression,
3688.74 there's some interesting
dose dependent responses,
3692.02 such that people who took
anywhere from 400 milligrams
3696.04 to 5,000 milligrams of EPAs,
3699.27 achieved a variety of different benefits.
3701.56 And in some cases, some side effects,
3703.3 we'll talk about those.
3705.35 And it does seem that this 1000 milligrams
3707.33 is the critical threshold for benefiting
3710.49 or getting some relief
from depressive symptoms.
3712.76 But people who took two
grams seem to do better.
3715.4 And in the cardiovascular health realm,
3717.72 there it's a little more complicated.
3719.72 Some studies point to
a very positive effect
3723.1 on cardiovascular health
3724.24 by taking increasing amounts
of EPA, others, not so much.
3729.17 The current data point to the fact
3731.3 that for every gram of
EPA that one ingest,
3733.92 there's about a 9% improvement
in cardiovascular health,
3737.25 the same dose dependent
improvement on psychological health
3741.776 in combating depression
can't really be stated.
3745.63 I wouldn't say that the more EPA you take,
3748.25 the better you're going
to feel so to speak.
3750.26 I don't think the data point to that.
3752.78 However, it does seem
that if you take a gram,
3755.58 1000 milligrams or 2000 milligrams of EPA,
3758.47 there does seem to be
some substantial relief
3760.87 for many people, should
emphasize many, not all,
3763.54 for many people in major
depressive symptoms.
3767.84 So how would this work?
3769.28 Well, turns out that these
inflammatory cytokines,
3773.12 they impact neurons and
the circuits of the brain
3776.64 that relate to things like serotonin,
3778.39 dopamine, and norepinephrine.
3780.6 These inflammatory cytokines
3782.43 act in a variety of different ways,
3784.41 but they mainly act to inhibit
the release of serotonin,
3787.35 norepinephrine, and dopamine,
or the synthesis of serotonin,
3792.04 norepinephrine and dopamine.
3793.38 And I'll give you one example of how EPAs
3796.18 can positively impact this process.
3798.1 And then it points to a second tool,
3799.9 which is the proper
utilization of exercise
3802.78 to offset the effects of depression.
3806.95 So now you should understand
why having healthy levels
3809.45 of serotonin is important
for maintaining healthy mood.
3812.82 It's not responsible for all the aspects
3815.89 of having a healthy mood,
3818.02 there's also dopamine and norepinephrine,
3819.61 but it is a very important one.
3821.84 Dopamine also called 5HT,
3826.32 essentially derives from a
precursor called tryptophan.
3830.6 Tryptophan arrives into our
system through our diet,
3834.47 okay, tryptophan is an amino acid.
3836.84 Tryptophan is found in Turkey,
it's found in carbohydrates.
3841.67 And that should therefore raise the idea,
3844.07 hmm, I wonder if one of
the reasons why people
3846.12 who are depressed have such an appetite
3847.77 for carbohydrate late in foods
3849.4 is because they're trying
to get more tryptophan,
3852.25 and therefore more serotonin.
3854.0 And indeed that's the case.
3856.77 Tryptophan is eventually
converted into serotonin.
3859.86 However, if there's excessive
amounts of inflammation,
3864.56 these inflammatory
cytokines cause tryptophan
3868.747 to not be converted so
much into serotonin,
3871.67 but to be diverted down
a different pathway.
3875.5 The pathway involves something
called IDO, Indoleamine,
3878.79 which converts tryptophan into kynurenine.
3883.545 Kynurenine actually acts as a neurotoxin
3887.07 by way of converting into
something called quinolinic acid.
3891.59 And quinolinic acid is pro depressive.
3893.54 So if that seems like a
complicated biochemical pathway,
3895.96 what's basically happening
here is that the tryptophan
3898.26 that normally would be
made into serotonin,
3901.47 under conditions of
inflammation is being diverted
3903.74 into a neurotoxic pathway.
3906.29 And ingestion of EPAs,
3908.07 because it limits these
inflammatory cytokines,
3911.18 things like IL-6, C-reactive
protein, et cetera,
3915.5 can cause more of the
tryptophan that one ingests
3919.94 or has in their body to be diverted
3921.96 towards the serotoninergic pathway.
3925.67 Exercise, it turns out,
also has a positive effect
3930.03 on the tryptophan to
serotonin conversion pathway.
3934.08 And the way it does it
is really interesting.
3935.93 You now know that tryptophan
can either be converted
3938.57 into serotonin or it can be
converted into this neurotoxin,
3941.33 which is a bad thing.
3943.86 Exercise, the activation of the muscles
3946.31 through rhythmic repeated use,
3947.92 in particular aerobic exercise,
but also resistance training
3951.06 has been shown to do this to some extent,
3953.5 tends to sequester or shuttle
the contouring into the muscle
3958.36 so that it isn't converted
into this neurotoxin
3961.35 that is pro depression, okay?
3963.93 There are a lot of steps in the pathway
3965.16 leading to depression,
3966.67 but what this essentially means
3968.15 is that hitting a certain
threshold level of EPA intake,
3972.41 whether by supplementation
with fish oil or krill oil
3975.53 or through some plant source
3976.94 if you're not into
ingesting fish or krill,
3979.76 or trying to get up above
that 1000 milligram threshold
3983.89 for EPA by ingesting
particular food sources,
3985.97 you certainly can do it through food,
3987.08 you don't have to supplement,
3988.58 but it's easier to do with supplements,
3991.41 that doing that will
limit the inflammation
3993.66 that diverts tryptophan into
this neurotoxic pathway.
3996.8 And exercise as well, augments
this conversion of tryptophan
4002.53 into serotonin because it takes this thing
4005.93 that would potentially be a
neurotoxin and it sequesters it,
4009.92 it pulls it away so that it can't actually
4012.26 go have its pro depressive effects.
4014.57 So you've got multiple steps here.
4017.04 We're describing two tools,
4019.23 increasing EPA and regular exercise
4021.56 as a way of increasing serotonin,
4024.0 somewhat indirectly, right?
4025.63 It's by limiting this bad pathway
4027.51 to promote the activity of a good pathway.
4030.25 But from the data that are published
4032.53 in Quality Peer Review journals,
4033.86 it really appears that
this inflammation pathway
4035.76 does function to increase
depression through these pathways.
4039.28 And so knowing that there
are behavioral steps
4041.41 and supplementation based steps,
4043.01 or if you prefer getting
your EPAs from typical food,
4046.99 from nutritional approaches,
4049.62 I find that very reassuring
that the mechanisms
4052.62 all converge on a common
pathway, serotonin.
4055.4 That gives me great peace of
mind that when people say,
4058.93 hey, go out for a run,
4060.88 or you should get outdoors exercise,
4062.63 or you should take fish oil
like the Scandinavians do,
4065.57 I have Scandinavian family
members and they are known to,
4069.88 or I should say they are
quite open about the fact
4072.32 that during the winter
months in particular
4074.11 when depression is more likely,
4075.96 but throughout the year, really,
4077.45 they make an effort to regularly
ingest high levels of EPA,
4081.98 either through ingesting
fatty fish and its skin,
4086.22 I'm not a particular fan of ingesting
4087.69 the skin of fatty fish,
4088.58 or by supplementing with Cod liver oil
4090.79 or other types of fish oil, sardines,
4092.5 and things of that sort, sardine oils.
4094.59 There are a number of
different things out there
4095.84 that one could use.
4097.27 So I find it very reassuring
4099.61 that there's a common biochemical pathway
4101.71 that can explain why these
things not just work,
4104.86 but why they should work.
4106.55 They should work because they operate
4108.09 in the very same biochemical pathways
4110.57 that antidepressants that
are prescribed to people do.
4114.73 So what does this mean for you?
4115.8 Well, if you're somebody who
suffers from major depression,
4118.74 again, don't stop taking
your prescribed medication.
4121.08 Talk to your doctor,
4121.913 but talk to them perhaps
about the EPAs and exercise
4127.02 and how these things can impinge
4128.41 on the same biochemical pathways.
4130.19 If you're somebody who is not suffering
4131.42 from major depression, I
still think these pathways
4133.71 are really important to understand.
4135.55 And actually knowing these
pathways is additional motivation
4139.9 to get regular exercise.
4141.15 I think we all know that
we should be getting
4142.59 anywhere from 150 minutes
to 180 minutes per week
4145.86 of so-called zone two cardio
for cardiovascular effects.
4148.87 Zone two is the kind of melowish cardio
4150.76 where you can sort of hold a
conversation if you needed to.
4153.41 But it's a little bit tough,
4154.35 you're kind of sucking
for air a little bit.
4156.59 And that's going to limit
these depressive like symptoms,
4160.13 I think in all of us.
4160.99 I don't think that we
should think of depression
4162.93 as a strict threshold.
4164.77 I'm somebody who personally
has made the choice
4167.25 to take 1000 milligrams of EPA per day.
4170.77 I do that by supplementing fish oil.
4173.07 There's debate out there
as to whether or not
4175.15 it's better to take EPA
NDHA in particular ratios,
4179.9 and whether or not DHA can impact the LDL,
4183.36 which is the so-called bad cholesterol.
4185.3 That's getting really down into the weeds.
4187.01 And we can talk about
that in a future episode.
4189.2 But for myself, I notice
a pretty substantial
4193.44 positive effect of taking anywhere
4195.4 from 1000 milligrams to 2000
milligrams of EPA per day.
4198.49 I do that through supplementation
4199.78 and I do strive to try and eat some fish,
4202.12 even though frankly, I've
never liked the taste of fish.
4204.72 For those of you that would
like a little more detail
4206.77 or perhaps a lot more detail
into the effects of EPA
4210.38 on depression and in
relieving depressive symptoms,
4214.27 and if you want to get into
the nitty gritty of it,
4217.15 I invite you to go to examine.com,
put in depression, EPA,
4220.8 they list off and have links to 28 studies
4224.9 on the effects of EPA on major depression.
4227.13 If you go to pub med,
4228.14 there are many, many studies on this now
4231.24 that date back several decades, really.
4235.69 If you're interested in the
specific effects of EPA,
4239.31 as opposed to DHA,
4241.17 I want to point you towards
a particular study entitled,
4244.46 not surprisingly EPA, but not
DHA appears to be responsible
4248.29 for the efficacy of omega-3
long chain polyunsaturated
4251.05 fatty acids supplementation
and depression,
4253.23 evidence from a meta analysis
of randomized control trials.
4256.01 This is a really wonderful paper.
4258.13 The author is Julian
Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N-S.
4262.27 It was published in 2009.
4264.8 We will provide a link to
this study in the caption.
4268.15 And that study is really
the one that at least to me,
4270.43 points to why EPA in
particular is what's effective,
4275.13 and that whether or not
DHA is problematic or not
4279.3 as a separate issue,
but it's really the EPA
4282.22 that one wants to hit a
certain threshold level of
4285.2 if one's goal is to get
relief from depression
4288.21 or to keep depression at bay
by keeping mood elevated,
4291.63 which is why I take a high-dose EPA.
4295.03 So we've got EPA, we got exercise,
4297.27 now you understand how
they work to adjust mood.
4301.46 Now, I want to talk about
something that at least for me,
4304.67 was quite surprising when
I first learned about it
4307.44 for sake of treatment of mood disorders,
4310.44 and that's creatine.
4312.18 Creatine has a number of
very important functions
4314.93 throughout the body.
4316.26 For those of you that are
into resistance training,
4319.66 and actually for those of you
4320.72 that are into endurance training as well,
4322.84 creatine has achieved a lot
of popularity in recent years
4327.42 because supplementation with
creatine can draw more water
4331.24 into muscles and can increase
power output from muscles.
4334.41 So it's something that does indeed work.
4338.34 There have been debates
about whether or not
4340.52 it's unhealthy for the kidneys
to take long-term creatine,
4343.02 supplementation at high doses.
4344.54 And I invite you to go
down that rabbit hole.
4346.8 I think most people now accept the idea
4349.34 that for most people, not
all, but for most people,
4351.78 low dose creatine
supplementation of anywhere
4353.75 from one gram to five grams per day
4357.75 can have a number of positive effects
4359.42 on physical performance.
4361.4 People with kidney issues, et cetera,
4363.04 need to be especially cautious,
4364.31 but creatine is interesting
for that purpose.
4367.01 However, there's also a
so-called phosphocreatine system
4370.58 in the brain, and that
phosphocreatine system
4373.87 has everything to do with
the dialogue between neurons
4376.167 and these other cell types called, glial,
4378.73 and glial comprise several cell types,
4381.67 microglia, astrocytes, et cetera,
4384.32 but the foster creatine system
4386.69 in the forebrain in particular,
in the front of our brain,
4389.21 has been shown to be involved
in regulation of mood
4393.56 and some of the reward pathways
as well as in depression.
4398.01 And there are now several
studies, at least three,
4402.31 although they're probably more
by the time this comes out
4406.01 because they're coming
out very quickly now,
4408.0 at least three quality
studies pointing to the fact
4410.59 that creatine supplementation
4413.04 doesn't just have these positive effects
4415.35 on physical performance,
4416.33 but can also be used as
a way to increase mood
4421.02 and to improve the symptoms
of major depression.
4424.97 This has been now done
in several double blind
4429.16 placebo controlled studies.
4431.94 The studies have looked at women,
4434.06 have it looked at men,
have looked at adolescents,
4437.53 some of whom were taking
SSRIs, some of whom were not,
4441.47 they've done magnetic
resonance spectroscopy.
4445.9 So spectroscopy is a way that you can look
4448.86 at the concentrations of
particular in the brain
4452.23 in real time in humans,
4454.01 it can be used for other
things as well, of course.
4455.93 And basically what's been
observed is that increasing
4459.78 the activity of the phosphocreatine
system in the forebrain
4462.77 can be beneficial or
at least is correlated
4465.28 with improvements in mood.
4467.19 So let's just talk for a
moment about what's involved
4469.78 with using or supplementing creatine
4472.43 in order to improve mood and
perhaps even treat depression.
4477.45 First of all, when I talk about creatine,
4479.18 I'm talking about creatine monohydrate,
4482.34 there are a number of
different forms of creatine.
4484.35 Here I'm talking about
creatine monohydrate.
4487.31 The American Journal
of Psychiatry in 2012,
4490.76 published a study, which was a randomized,
4493.3 double blind placebo controlled trial
4494.81 of oral creatine monohydrate.
4496.46 And what it found is that it could augment
4499.47 or enhance the response
to a selective serotonin
4501.97 re-uptake inhibitor,
4503.57 in particular, in women with
major depressive disorder.
4507.36 So like EPA, creatine supplementation
4510.97 seems to either lower the required dose
4513.78 of SSRI that's required
to treat depression,
4516.58 or can improve the effectiveness
of a given dose of SSRI.
4522.91 However, there are other studies
that have looked directly
4525.27 at creating supplementation
in the absence of SSRIs.
4527.97 And those are interesting as well.
4529.39 There's a wonderful and
very comprehensive review
4532.8 on creatine for the
treatment of major depression
4535.81 that includes beautiful
tables of all the subjects
4539.147 and the dosages, et cetera.
4540.6 I'm not going to read off every line
4542.51 and every column in that review,
4546.2 but we will provide a link
to that review as well.
4550.27 One of the things that's really striking
4552.01 about the lists of
studies that they include
4554.87 is that most of them used dosages
4558.13 that are pretty reasonable
for most people,
4561.01 anywhere from three grams to five grams,
4564.81 sometimes up to as many 10
grams per day of creatine.
4570.22 Many of these also were shown to increase
4572.56 activity of this phosphocreatine
system in the forebrain,
4576.06 and some show a relationship
4578.64 between that phosphocreatine system
4581.29 and a particular category
of receptors in the brain
4584.53 called the NMDA receptor,
N-methyl D-aspartate receptor.
4591.223 The NMDA receptor is
one of the first things
4595.12 that every budding
neuroscientists learns about
4598.04 because it is the receptor
that has particular electrical
4602.21 and chemical properties
that make it a critical gate
4606.66 for so-called neuroplasticity.
4609.0 So it's not a receptor that's
activated in the brain,
4613.32 typically for just the
functioning of the brain
4616.38 on a day-to-day basis.
4617.71 It's a receptor that's activated
4619.29 when circuits are going to change,
4621.95 when they are inspired to change
4623.83 by some very strong stimulus,
meaning some experience,
4627.48 or in some cases a drug, or
in some cases something else.
4631.46 But the NMDA receptor
is a kind of a key node
4635.81 for shifting brain circuitry.
4637.38 And so while the details
aren't entirely clear,
4640.14 it seems that creatine supplementation
4643.21 leads to increases in the
phosphocreatine system
4646.32 in the forebrain.
4647.71 And that increases in the
activity of the forebrain
4651.783 phosphocreatine system relate to changes
4654.35 in the way the NMDA receptors function
4656.98 and may lead to some of the plasticity,
4658.91 the changes in neural
circuits that underlie
4661.54 the shift from negative mood
and affect to positive mood.
4664.98 Now, there are a lot of gaps.
4667.326 There are a lot of little
boxes or bins in the diagram
4669.72 I just laid out for you.
4670.92 And some of them are still
truly black boxes, as we say,
4673.69 meaning, we don't really
know what's in them yet.
4675.73 And more mechanistic data are coming.
4677.43 However, when you look over
the data in this review,
4679.63 or when I look over the
data in this review,
4682.153 what you find is that
they're pretty striking
4684.11 positive effects of creatine.
4687.45 And one of the more interesting effects
4690.23 is that creatine has actually been shown
4692.99 to increase mania in people
that are already manic.
4698.7 And that's interesting,
4699.77 we're not talking about
bipolar depression today,
4702.05 but it seems that creatine
elevates levels of activation
4705.53 and kind of mood overall.
4706.66 And you could see why
that would be a problem
4708.19 for somebody that's
already in a manic phase,
4709.99 but it actually might be
beneficial for somebody
4712.56 who is very low affect
and has major depression.
4717.25 So should you supplement with creatine?
4719.22 Well, as always, talk to
your healthcare provider,
4722.59 but if you're somebody who
is thinking about things
4725.81 that you can do and
things that you can take
4728.04 in order to improve your
mood, keep depression at bay,
4730.72 maybe even support other
treatments for major depression.
4736.09 the creatine system
seems like a logical one.
4738.72 There's at least strong studies
and a good number of them
4742.69 to look to, to determine whether or not
4744.8 that's right for you.
4746.28 I personally take five grams
of creatine for other reasons.
4750.55 I take it for the physical
performance, enhancing effects,
4755.64 but it's kind of nice
to think that perhaps
4757.74 it's also helping me improve my mood.
4759.83 That's a choice that I've made for me
4761.17 is in within the margins of
safety for me in my life.
4764.16 I don't know that it's
right for everybody,
4766.07 but I find it very interesting.
4767.9 And again, I find it
particularly interesting
4769.94 because there's a logical
biochemical pathway
4772.84 to support the finding
that it improves mood
4775.24 and can offset the effects
of major depression
4777.67 in some cases, or can improve the effects
4780.15 of antidepressant
medication in many cases.
4784.05 When I see mechanism
and I see effectiveness,
4787.3 and the mechanism and
the effectiveness map
4789.63 to a lot of the same mechanisms
4791.24 that are involved in prescription drugs,
4792.77 that gives me great reassurance
that this isn't just
4795.24 some sort of mysterious
pathway or mysterious compound
4799.31 by which a creatine might be working.
4801.61 So now we've kind of
clustered together EPAs,
4805.04 exercise, and their
relationship to inflammation,
4807.91 creatine and its relationship
to forebrain function,
4811.4 and the phosphocreatine
system, and this NMDA receptor.
4815.96 And as you'll see in a few minutes,
4817.13 that NMDA receptor turns
out to be vitally important
4820.58 and is actually one of
the main nodes of action
4823.65 for some of the more novel
and exciting therapeutics
4826.18 that are being explored
now in psychiatric clinics.
4829.85 So let's talk a little bit
more about this NMDA receptor
4833.23 and how it relates to some
of the more experimental
4836.75 or novel therapeutic
compounds for the treatment
4839.17 of major depression.
4840.23 And the compounds that we're
going to be talking about,
4843.66 you may have heard of
before, one is ketamine,
4847.02 which is getting increasing
interest in psychiatric clinics
4850.67 and in various experimental
and clinical studies,
4853.52 and the other is PCP.
4855.87 Both ketamine and PCP
are known drugs of abuse.
4859.98 For many years, people
have abused these drugs,
4862.58 go by the street name,
special K, et cetera.
4865.48 And they create dissociative
anesthetic states.
4868.89 So dissociative states
where people don't feel
4872.11 as closely meshed with their
emotions and their perceptions.
4877.72 It's an odd state, I hear.
4880.82 And it's an odd state that clinicians
4883.09 are now leveraging for the
treatment of depression.
4885.4 And we'll talk about why that is,
4886.72 but let's talk a little bit
about this NMDA receptor
4889.61 and why ketamine and PCP
might work for the treatment
4893.34 of depression or how they even could work.
4897.15 I want to be very direct
that this is an area
4900.19 that still needs a lot of data.
4902.99 There are however, some excellent papers
4904.94 from really terrific groups.
4907.17 One of them is a paper that
was published in nature
4910.06 last year, 2020.
4912.15 First author is Vesuna,
Sam Vesuna, V-E-S-U-N-A,
4915.887 and the last author and
the lead on the study,
4917.81 who was Dr. Karl Deisseroth,
4920.85 who was a guest on the
Huberman Lab podcast
4924.692 a few months ago.
4925.68 He's world expert in
neuroscience, he's a psychiatrist.
4929.23 And this paper from Sam
Vesuna and Karl and colleagues
4934.21 explored how these
dissociative states come about.
4937.14 And they looked at this both
in animals and in humans
4940.44 and found that there was a,
4941.87 essentially a common mechanism
4943.83 whereby a particular layer of cortex,
4947.4 so your brain has this
outer shell of tissue
4951.52 that is called the neocortex.
4953.21 It's where our perceptions lie,
4955.39 it's where our associations lie,
4957.21 it's a very important area for processing
4959.79 decision-making and planning, et cetera.
4963.1 It's literally stacks of cells,
4965.027 and one of those layers in the
stack of cells is layer five.
4968.96 And the layer five neurons in particular,
4970.98 went into a particular rhythm
of electrical activity,
4974.09 this one to three Hertz
rhythm after mice or humans
4979.72 were administered ketamine or PCP.
4984.37 There was activation of a
particular area of the brain,
4987.09 this retro splenium cortex as it's called.
4990.59 And the dissociative state that emerged
4994.18 was an interesting one.
4995.9 And clinically what's
described in the trials
4999.19 for ketamine and things like it,
5001.53 that people who are
depressed will take ketamine,
5005.36 will experience a kind of separateness
5008.13 from their grief and from their emotions.
5011.08 And that possibly there's plasticity,
5013.7 there actually shifts
in the neural circuitry,
5015.69 such that their emotions don't
weigh on them so heavily,
5019.63 I'm using very loose language here,
5021.81 but that they don't feel as over written
5025.68 or as burdened by their own emotions
5028.36 as they did previously
to the ketamine therapy.
5030.76 Now, absolutely in no way, shape or form
5033.15 am I suggesting that people
run out and take ketamine
5035.17 in order to treat their own depression.
5036.99 These drugs are still
very much experimental,
5040.54 although they are approved
in certain contexts,
5044.02 at least in the U S,
5045.77 by prescription for the
treatment of depression.
5049.24 What's interesting to me is
that these dissociative states
5053.41 sound at least at the outset
to be more of a separateness
5058.3 from everything.
5060.16 It sounds a little bit
like depression itself.
5062.4 That's sort of like
anhedonia and an inability
5065.8 to experience pleasure.
5067.35 And then one takes a
dissociative anesthetic
5070.55 and somehow is able to get relief
5072.98 by getting even further
away from an experience.
5076.04 To me, that doesn't make sense,
5077.65 but that just speaks to
the fact that these drugs
5080.547 and these receptors and these pathways
5083.67 operate through very cryptic means.
5086.72 And we really don't understand
all the pathways in the brain
5089.1 that relate to motivation
and mood and so forth.
5091.78 And the results with these ketamine trials
5093.54 are looking very promising.
5095.64 In fact, there are a number of trials
5098.02 that show that a fair number
of people that take ketamine
5101.28 in a therapeutic setting
legally with a psychiatrist
5104.33 guiding the experience
5105.97 are able to get relief from their symptoms
5108.56 without the need for many,
many treatments with the drug.
5113.43 Just how many treatments varies
5114.69 from individual to individual,
5115.94 but it's not like people have
to take this stuff ongoing.
5118.47 This is really an attempt to
tap into this NMDA receptor
5122.42 that is related to neuroplasticity.
5125.78 Both ketamine and PCP
essentially act as antagonists,
5130.6 which means they block the NMDA receptor.
5134.7 They do it through different methods,
5136.73 non-competitive and competitive for you
5138.85 chemists and pharmacologists out there.
5140.367 You can look it up if you like.
5142.33 But what's therefore even more surprising
5145.17 is that every neuroscientist
learns that activation
5148.45 of the NMDA receptor,
5150.41 not antagonism or blocking
of the NMDA receptor
5153.69 leads to changes in neural
circuitry in very profound ways.
5156.49 In fact experimentally,
5157.94 and I've done these experiments myself,
5159.23 if you want to prevent plasticity,
5161.44 you want to prevent an experience
5163.71 from reshaping neural circuitry,
5165.22 you give an MDA receptor blocker.
5168.07 I've done that many times
5169.25 in the course of my experimental
neuroscience career,
5171.8 not to myself, obviously,
5172.92 but in the course of doing experiments.
5176.86 So it's still a bit mysterious
to me how this could work.
5181.33 A couple things.
5182.163 One is this layer five
activation is pretty interesting.
5186.75 We're going to come back to layer five
5188.31 when we talk about yet another emerging
5191.13 treatment for depression,
which has psilocybin,
5193.25 so-called magic mushrooms,
5195.94 and the effects of psilocybin
on layer five neurons
5199.98 in the cortex.
5201.04 So there's a common theme emerging here,
5202.65 which is that layer five
activity in the cortex
5205.4 may be important for rewiring
the brain in certain ways
5208.26 that can lead to recovery
or to an alleviation
5213.65 of some of the symptoms
of major depression.
5217.35 So if this is sounding a
little bit vague to you,
5219.46 it's because this is still
truly experimental and new,
5223.42 and still very much on the cutting edge
5225.65 of what's happening now.
5226.98 We don't have all the answers.
5228.48 So if it sounds like I'm
moving slowly through this,
5230.58 and I'm being extra
careful about what I say,
5232.579 you are correct.
5234.43 Your antenna are correct in this case.
5239.12 I never want to misstep and
say something that's not true,
5241.8 but that's especially the case
5244.01 when we're talking about
experimental therapies and drugs,
5246.28 which formerly were
taken as drugs of abuse,
5248.26 which are now being used as
drugs for therapeutic treatment
5250.87 in the clinic.
5253.34 There is a very interesting study.
5255.89 This was published in science in 2019.
5258.67 So these are very recent studies.
5261.16 The last author on this
is Liston, L-I-S-T-O-N.
5264.48 The title of the paper is
5265.897 "Sustained Rescue of
Prefrontal Circuit Dysfunction
5269.297 "by Antidepressant
Induced Spine Formation."
5272.22 And here, when we hear spine,
5274.21 we're not referring to
spine as in your vertebrae,
5277.4 running down your spinal column,
5279.97 we're talking about the spines,
5281.13 which are these little
protrusions on neurons.
5284.23 Neurons are not smooth by any stretch.
5287.41 If you zoom in on a neuron,
if you were to come to my lab
5290.5 and look down the microscope
at a neuron and zoom in on it,
5293.17 you'd find that some neurons are smooth,
5294.48 but most neurons have
these little protrusions.
5296.39 And those little protrusions
are called spines.
5298.44 And those little spiny
protrusions are little sites
5302.03 where neurons can reach
out and form and receive
5304.94 new synapses from neighboring neurons.
5307.79 So they increase the
surface area of a neuron
5309.92 and allow new connections to be formed.
5312.0 And so spine formation is
synonymous with neuroplasticity,
5316.39 which is synonymous with
changes in circuit function,
5318.85 which is synonymous with changes
in the ways that we think,
5322.57 we feel, and we behave.
5325.19 And what was shown in the
study is really interesting.
5327.96 What they showed is that ketamine
5329.9 can relieve depressive symptoms rapidly
5333.44 by changing or increasing in this case,
5336.95 the spines on these neurons
in the prefrontal cortex.
5340.7 And if that word prefrontal rings a bell,
5342.78 well, now you remember the
phosphocreatine system,
5345.903 the ingestion of creatine
monohydrate, and the forebrain,
5350.66 activation of the
forebrain were related to,
5354.06 in some way or another,
to relief or improvement
5357.36 of major depressive symptoms.
5359.43 So we're starting to
converge on a picture here
5361.85 whereby these drugs, ketamine, PCP,
5365.43 used in a therapeutic context,
5367.41 may be increasing neuroplasticity.
5370.58 Literally the changing of
neurocircuits in the forebrain
5373.68 somehow through dissociative states.
5376.59 And I don't want to speculate too much
5378.69 about how that might come about,
5380.64 but one of the things
that's such a resounding
5384.76 or repeating theme of major depression
5387.65 is that when you talk to somebody
who has major depression,
5390.11 it is a real downer.
5392.04 And I'm not being
disparaging of those people.
5394.23 But if you've ever had a conversation
5395.42 with someone who's depressed,
5397.01 they're always talking about
how exhausted they are,
5399.23 or in really severe cases,
5401.18 they are not even responsive at all.
5402.86 They just kind of stare at you
blankly, or they fall asleep.
5406.53 I mean, they're truly depressed.
5408.19 Their system is lowered in
terms of its activation state.
5412.17 So I think that it's
interesting that the application
5416.75 of drugs that allow people
to separate from that state
5420.72 of not caring or being
uninterested or unwilling
5423.6 to do anything is actually
one of the paths to treatment.
5426.72 It's not always about
just getting people peppy
5429.3 and excited and happy.
5431.47 There also seems to be requirement
5432.95 for getting them distanced
from their own grief.
5436.39 And this brings us back to
something that we talked about
5438.73 way back at the beginning of this episode,
5440.89 which was this particular feature
5443.97 of the anti self confabulation,
5446.81 that everything that
happens is a reflection
5449.35 that I should say for
the depressed person,
5450.98 that everything that
happens is a reflection
5452.79 of how life is bad and their experiences
5454.99 just point to the fact that
nothing is going to get better.
5458.14 This is the common language of depression.
5460.14 If this is very depressing
to hear me talk about it,
5463.17 it is heavy.
5464.09 And that's what it's like
to hear these things,
5466.37 it's even heavier, of course,
5467.47 for somebody to experience them.
5469.51 And those beliefs, those
patterns of guilt and grief
5474.83 and anhedonia and delusional
anti self confabulation,
5478.89 those are the things that eventually,
5480.53 if they get severe enough,
5482.17 start to convert into things
like self harm mutilation,
5486.22 and in the most tragic of
cases, of course, suicide.
5489.61 And so I think we can
look to these treatments
5493.46 such as ketamine and PCP,
5495.7 but in particular ketamine
and its use in the clinic,
5498.67 as ways for people to get
distanced from the negative affect
5502.7 that they feel isn't just
inside them or overwhelms them,
5506.64 but that for the very
severely depressed person,
5509.33 they feel is them.
5511.46 And we hear this sometimes,
you are not your emotions.
5514.1 That's a statement that I've
always been a little bit
5515.65 challenged by.
5516.483 I mean, yes, indeed
emotions are not who we are.
5521.17 They are states that
we go into and out of,
5523.15 including happiness and sadness,
5524.99 but they are very much a part
of us when we experience them.
5528.98 We don't experience them
as next to us or behind us
5531.25 or across the room from us.
5532.88 We experienced them as our emotions.
5534.94 They are so much part and
parcel with our experience
5538.65 of ourself that a statement
like we aren't our emotions
5542.35 is a very hard statement to digest,
5544.16 especially for the depressed person.
5546.06 And so I think that the NMDA
receptor and its capacity
5550.11 to induce neuroplasticity,
circuit changes,
5552.52 the fact that PCP and
ketamine are both showing
5554.86 activation of neural circuits
by way of suppressing
5558.7 activity of the NMDA receptor,
5560.19 and some of the positive or
exciting therapeutic outcomes
5563.47 that are coming from this
really point to the fact
5565.79 that ketamine and PCP and
removal of negative experiences
5571.23 or the experience of
a negative experience,
5573.71 sort of getting meta there.
5575.12 But the experience of
a negative experience
5576.95 may be an important path by which people
5579.84 treat their depression, especially
in its most severe forms
5582.66 where people are veering
towards self-harm, mutilation,
5585.98 and suicide.
5587.53 So you may have noticed a theme,
5588.9 which is that certain
categories of approaches
5591.12 that we've been discussing for offsetting
5592.74 the symptoms of depression,
such as exercise,
5596.5 ingesting EPAs, reducing inflammation,
5599.83 or even the SSRIs for
increasing serotonin,
5603.85 focus on changing some
core biological function,
5607.47 like raising the amount
of a chemical, serotonin,
5609.74 or reducing the amount
of inflammatory cytokines
5613.41 in the brain and body.
5615.78 And yet things like ketamine
5618.27 focus more on rewiring circuitry,
5620.76 changing neural circuitry
so that it functions better
5623.98 in the immediate and hopefully
in the long-term as well,
5626.42 and keep people with major depression
5628.08 in what they call, remission,
away from major depression.
5632.15 Another category of treatments
5633.82 that's being actively
explored now in laboratories
5637.08 and in the psychiatry
realm are the psychedelics.
5640.82 And that's a huge category of compounds.
5644.87 However, one in particular,
5646.65 psilocybin is one that's
being most intensely
5649.86 and actively pursued for its capacity
5652.07 to treat major depressive disorder.
5654.27 I want to be very clear that the work
5656.31 that I'm going to describe
as work that's being done
5658.9 in university settings,
university hospitals,
5661.87 by scientists and psychiatrists,
5665.86 and these are clinical
studies, clinical trials,
5668.27 leading to peer reviewed data.
5670.38 And those are the data
that we'll be discussing.
5673.26 Some of the major luminaries
in this area include,
5676.52 of course aren't limited to,
5678.211 but include people like Matthew Johnson
5679.044 who's at Johns Hopkins.
5680.35 We'll discuss some of his
work now, and fortunate to say
5682.92 that he will be coming
on the podcast as a guest
5684.98 to just scribe the studies
in a variety of laboratories,
5689.35 working on a variety of
different psychedelic compounds,
5692.74 but let's focus on
psilocybin for its capacity
5695.7 to rewire neural circuits
and alleviate depression.
5700.24 There have been anecdotal data
or evidence over the years
5704.54 that psilocybin has this capacity,
how does psilocybin work?
5707.73 Well, psilocybin, magic mushrooms,
as it's sometimes called,
5711.63 mainly works on what's called
the serotonin 5H2A receptor
5717.41 with some affinity for the 5HT1 receptor.
5720.02 What does that mean?
5720.853 Well, basically, you've
got a lot of different
5722.26 kinds of serotonin
receptors just as you have
5724.64 a lot of different kinds
of dopamine receptors
5726.51 or other types of receptors.
5728.24 The advantage of having
different receptors
5730.33 expressed in different
parts of the brain and body,
5733.04 even on different parts
of individual cells
5735.57 in the brain and body is that
the same compound, serotonin,
5738.67 can have a diverse set of effects
5740.97 on different cells and tissues.
5742.58 This is also the basis of some
of the side effect profiles
5745.72 of SSRIs, because maybe for instance,
5750.06 we know that taking Prozac fluoxetine
5752.54 will increase serotonin in one area,
5754.08 but also in another area.
5755.32 And then they will go have diverse effects
5757.54 on different brain circuits
5758.82 because of the variety of receptors.
5760.9 Receptors are just like parking slots
5762.88 where the molecule serotonin parks
5765.06 and has different effects.
5766.54 Well psilocybin engages
5769.98 or increases serotonin transmission,
5772.81 meaning it increases
the amount of serotonin,
5775.45 mainly by acting at these 5H2A receptors,
5779.03 but where in the brain does it happen
5781.23 and what are the major effects?
5782.46 First, let's talk about the major effects
5783.89 'cause I think that's what
people are interested in.
5786.15 The study that I'd like to
highlight is a fairly recent one.
5789.95 It was published in may of 2021 in Journal
5794.842 of the American Medical
Association Psychiatry,
5797.28 so JAMA Psychiatry, and it's entitled,
5800.287 "Effects of Psilocybin Assisted Therapy
5802.407 "on Major Depressive Disorder,
a Randomized Clinical Trial."
5805.85 It's an absolutely beautiful
study, a very important study.
5809.09 It includes some of the
luminaries in this area
5811.14 like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan,
5813.67 Roland Griffiths, and others.
5815.36 We will provide a link to this study.
5818.13 It is available in its
full form at zero cost
5822.12 if you want to read it.
5822.953 It's got a lot of detail.
5823.84 So I'm just going to
summarize a few things,
5825.41 but basically what they did
was they screened for patients
5829.51 to come into the clinic.
5830.43 These were people that suffered
5831.46 from major depressive disorder,
5833.87 and administered either one
or two rounds of psilocybin.
5840.3 They used particular dosages
that are listed in the study.
5842.66 So you can look it up if
you're really interested
5844.02 in that level of detail.
5845.71 Typically it was 20 milligrams
per kilogram of body weight.
5849.29 So it depends on body weight.
5850.83 Or 30 milligrams of
psilocybin per 70 kilograms
5855.39 of body weight.
5856.96 They were given in capsule form.
5858.14 So people weren't eating the mushrooms.
5859.64 This is obviously a very controlled study
5862.44 and they wanted to control
the dosages appropriately.
5866.23 They were randomized to begin
the treatment immediately
5868.65 or after an eight week delay.
5870.8 They had all the
appropriate control groups
5872.48 that one would like to see.
5874.01 What's really striking this study
5876.43 is that there was a very
significant improvement
5880.76 in mood and affect and relief
from depressive symptoms
5884.37 in anywhere from 50 to 70% of the people
5889.21 that were subjects in
the study who received
5893.99 the psilocybin treatment.
5896.17 And whether or not it was 50
or whether or not it was 71%,
5900.1 varied according to how
long after the study
5903.11 they maintain these
antidepressive effects,
5905.42 whether or not they stayed in
remission from the depression,
5907.7 but these are really enormous
insignificant effects,
5910.847 and very exciting and are
pointing in the direction
5915.67 of psilocybin very soon,
becoming a treatment
5919.67 for various forms of depression,
including major depression.
5923.84 Now, of course, this is
limited to the laboratory
5927.08 at present.
5928.21 There are a number of
elements of these studies
5930.18 that are important to take
into consideration too,
5932.02 which is that there are
highly trained guides,
5935.38 meaning people to direct
people through the experience.
5938.65 As Matthew Johnson has told me,
5940.71 there is the occurrence from time to time
5943.64 of people having so-called bad trips
5945.41 of having anxiety attacks
during the hallucinations
5948.0 and all that.
5948.833 And they have ways to mitigate
that and deal with that
5950.98 because the guides are trained.
5952.81 They have all the sorts of
medical monitoring devices
5956.73 for heart rate and temperature and things
5958.3 that one would like to
see for a study like this,
5962.01 because these are very powerful compounds.
5964.33 I don't want to give away any
elements of the discussion
5966.83 with Matthew Johnson,
5968.31 because it will be
released in podcast form
5970.47 reasonably soon here,
the Huberman Lab podcast.
5973.8 But one of the things that came up
5975.58 and is a fundamental question that I had,
5977.18 that I think probably
many of you are asking,
5978.88 is does the experience that
one has on these compounds
5983.82 make a difference for whether
or not somebody gains relief
5986.5 from depression, from these
psilocybin journeys or not?
5990.8 In other words, does it
matter what they talk about?
5992.82 Does it matter what they think about?
5993.95 Does it matter if they have
a good trip or a bad trip?
5996.02 And I don't want to hold
you in too much suspense,
5998.74 I'll let Matthew provide
the more thorough answer.
6000.99 But what's really interesting
6002.65 is there are some common themes
to psilocybin administration
6008.33 and experience that lead to
relief from depressive symptoms,
6011.46 but they are subjectively very varied,
6017.5 meaning that whether or not people feel
6020.52 they had a good experience
or a bad experience,
6022.57 whether or not people
thought about their parents
6024.65 or thought about the color of the ceiling,
6027.47 doesn't seem to have too much of an impact
6030.17 on whether or not they receive relief
6032.84 during these studies in
these clinical studies.
6037.27 It seems like different people can have
6038.9 lots of different experiences
and still receive benefit.
6042.81 And that points to something deeper.
6045.47 It points to the fact that these drugs,
6048.2 which is really what they are,
6049.83 are rewiring neural
circuitry in a common way
6053.83 despite a diversity of
experience while on the drug.
6057.03 And that itself is really interesting.
6058.75 And it takes us back to a
place that we've been before
6061.15 in this discussion, which
is layer five of the cortex.
6064.11 This area that ketamine
seems to impact as well
6066.56 by generating rhythms of the,
6068.223 I mentioned one to three Hertz activity
6070.21 in layer five of certain
areas of the cortex.
6073.29 Well, the 5HT1A receptor
is known to be enriched
6077.52 in layer five of the cortex,
6079.85 and layer five of the cortex
is a very interesting area
6083.57 because it's an area in which
6085.13 there's a lot of lateral connectivity.
6087.34 So connections between
different brain areas laterally,
6090.68 generally is what allows us
to merge different senses.
6094.6 So for instance, when we
hear a sound off to our right
6097.05 over here, we turn to our right.
6099.24 There's a very hardwired response.
6101.05 And typically we hear
something off to our right,
6102.72 we don't look to our left.
6104.19 That's how hardwired some
of these circuits are.
6106.75 What appears to be happening
is that the activation
6109.37 of the serotonin system and
5HT1A receptor in layer five
6113.63 is offering up or providing an experience
6117.49 whereby the lateral
connections are able to engage
6121.3 much more broadly than
they would normally.
6123.88 Now that also could be a bad thing.
6127.12 And I asked Matt about this,
that sounds kind of spooky.
6130.53 I don't know that when I hear
something off to my right,
6132.66 that I want to look off to my left.
6133.95 That could be highly maladaptive,
6135.49 especially if it's a car
coming at me from my right.
6138.5 That doesn't seem to be what's happening.
6140.03 It's not really rewiring these
deeply reflexive circuits.
6144.08 It's somehow rewiring
associations between events,
6147.72 emotional events, past
events, current events,
6150.28 and future events in
ways that allow people
6153.14 to get some sort of relief or distance
6155.75 from these narratives,
these depressive stories
6159.18 about their past and
present and allow them
6161.5 to see new opportunity and
optimism in the future.
6164.373 It's really a fascinating thing
6167.02 if you really think about it,
6168.44 because I would have thought
6170.51 that simply by ramping up
laterality of connections,
6173.91 meaning that cross associations,
6176.1 that things could either
be rewired randomly
6179.68 in ways that don't serve us,
6181.3 or would perhaps just
cause no effect at all.
6184.9 So it's either going to be bad or neutral,
6186.52 but that's not really the
way things are turning out.
6188.73 Again, these are highly
controlled studies.
6190.64 I do want to emphasize
that ketamine, psilocybin,
6193.21 these things are still illegal.
6194.78 Most all places.
6196.5 There are some regions and
cities in the United States
6199.19 where they are locally decriminalized,
6201.47 but they are not legal.
6202.6 They're still illegal.
6203.56 So what we're referring to here
are indeed clinical studies
6206.55 in which people are taking them legally.
6209.81 I think it's very likely
we will see a shift
6212.94 in the legislature around psychedelics,
6215.42 and in particular, psilocybin
in the not too distant future.
6219.72 And I think that for
now, what we should know
6223.19 is what Matt told me and what
you'll hear far more about,
6228.19 which is that psilocybin.
this one where in most cases,
6232.69 two dose treatments done in
a highly clinical setting,
6235.97 controlled setting with patients
6238.56 that are carefully
selected, can in many cases,
6241.61 the majority of people
receive and maintain relief
6245.31 from their depressive symptoms,
6247.16 simply through the experience
of this psychedelic journey.
6251.54 I did ask them about micro dosing.
6254.96 I made it sound as if I'd
never heard about it before.
6257.008 Microdosing, not micro dosing.
6258.94 Microdosing, and his
answer was interesting.
6262.7 His answer was that
the microdosing effects
6265.52 don't seem to be nearly as
impactful as some of these,
6269.85 well, let's just call them what they are.
6271.35 These kind of high amplitude sessions
6274.53 that there are just one or two,
6277.86 there are some studies ongoing
where there's more than two,
6280.78 but that the microdosing
doesn't seem to compare
6283.18 to these macrodosing, I
mentioned the dosages before,
6287.66 this 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms
6289.67 or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms dosages
6293.159 given several weeks apart.
6296.01 So you'll hear more about microdosing
6298.27 and other psychedelics and their impact
6300.48 on depressive states and major depression
6304.23 in the episode with Matt.
6305.69 But for the time being, it
really seems as if, again,
6308.27 we're looking at neuroplasticity,
6309.62 we're coming back to layer five,
6311.08 just like with ketamine and PCP.
6313.1 We're hearing about layer five,
6314.37 we're hearing about rewiring of circuitry,
6315.98 we're hearing about a
dissociation or a distancing
6318.61 of oneself from these
negative moods and affects
6323.3 and narratives, but
there's a key distinction
6326.76 between the ketamine work
and the psilocybin work,
6330.17 which is that in the ketamine work,
6331.55 it really is about
dissociating from experience
6334.61 during the session with the psychiatrist,
6336.85 whereas during the psilocybin journey,
6338.79 it's really about immersing
oneself in the experience
6341.77 and being fully present
to that experience.
6343.89 That does seem to be
an important component
6345.75 and what the difference is there
6347.49 and why they both seem
to provide some relief
6350.6 from major depression isn't clear.
6353.48 I think most likely it
takes us back to the fact
6356.43 that this thing we call major depression
6359.29 clearly involves serotonin,
dopamine, and norepinephrine.
6363.53 And in some individuals,
they may be more deficient
6366.19 in one or several of
those or all of those,
6368.65 whereas in other individuals,
6369.78 it might be a different
collection of chemicals.
6372.23 And of course there
are a tremendous number
6374.41 of other psychedelic compounds
that people are exploring
6378.62 for treatment of major depression.
6381.27 But really psilocybin is the one
6382.65 that we have the most data on.
6384.59 MDMA has mainly been explored
in the clinical realm
6389.1 for treatment of trauma.
6390.3 There are some trials ongoing
for treatment of depression,
6394.47 but the big breakthrough
seemed to be happening
6398.2 in the realm of trauma treatment,
6400.44 the so-called maps
group that's doing this,
6402.52 again, legally in a clinical setting.
6404.89 And there are other groups
6405.89 that are starting to do it as well.
6407.31 We are going to do an
entire podcast about MDMA
6410.557 and some related compounds.
6412.24 So I'll save that discussion for then.
6414.61 One of the most common
questions I get for this podcast
6417.37 is about different
diets, different regimes,
6420.76 different nutritional
plans, things like keto,
6423.377 ketogenic diet, or vegan
diets, or intermittent fasting,
6428.04 or the all meat diet, the
so-called lion diet, et cetera.
6431.79 There are actually really interesting data
6434.41 relating nutrition and diet
to major depressive disorder.
6438.76 And I think we just need to frame this
6441.69 by returning to something
that was said earlier,
6443.6 which is that the
ingestion of carbohydrates,
6446.72 in particular carbohydrates
and some meats like turkey,
6449.68 that are rich in tryptophan,
this precursor to serotonin,
6454.68 are in many ways the
self-medicating version
6459.77 of depression treatment.
6461.75 Now, to be clear, I'm not saying
6463.18 that people should use food
to medicate their depression.
6466.14 Many people do that reflexively however,
6468.35 they reach for carbohydrate rich foods
6470.27 to blunt their cortisol, because
that's indeed what it does.
6473.79 It blunts cortisol when you
ingest high carbohydrate foods,
6476.12 in particular starchy foods,
6477.75 and it does increase serotonin,
6480.84 in particular, if those
foods rather are rich
6484.81 in the amino acid tryptophan.
6486.94 Now ingesting food is wonderful
and important and great,
6490.36 but ingesting excessive
foods of any kinds,
6492.42 carbohydrate or otherwise
it's not healthy, of course.
6496.47 There have been some explorations
6499.24 of whether or not a vegan diet can improve
6502.05 symptoms of depression.
6503.15 Not a lot of data, not impressive data.
6505.5 There have been very
few controlled studies
6507.75 looking at the carnivore or all meat diet.
6511.14 On that, I think there are now some
6512.74 that are starting to spin up,
6514.06 meaning those studies
are starting to spin up.
6515.58 However, the ketogenic
diet has been explored
6519.17 for its ability to relieve
certain symptoms of depression,
6525.13 in particular to what's
called maintain euthymia.
6529.461 Euthymia is the kind
of state of equilibrium
6531.85 between a manic episode
and a depressive episode
6535.06 in a manic bipolar person.
6536.38 We'll return to this
more in a future episode,
6538.25 but it basically, maniacs
have highs and they have lows,
6541.89 bipolars, either cycle back
and forth really quickly.
6544.36 So rapid cycling bipolars
or slow, some people
6547.4 So really quickly can be day to day,
6549.25 other people it's month
to month or week to week,
6551.16 they're going highs and lows.
6553.49 And you hear about mania and
you hear about dysphoria,
6556.09 euthymia is that kind
of place in the middle
6559.2 where people feel neither
too high nor too low.
6562.89 And there are some interesting studies
6565.21 looking at the ketogenic
diet for maintaining euthymia
6568.45 in manic depressives,
6569.74 but also in people with
major depressive disorder.
6572.57 Why would this work?
6573.63 Well, we have to remember
that the ketogenic diet
6576.63 wasn't discovered so that
self appointed nutrition gurus
6581.46 could talk about it
online or so that people
6584.41 could make money selling
anything related to ketosis.
6588.05 And here I'm not disparaging
of the ketogenic diet.
6589.97 It's helped a lot of people.
6590.803 The ketogenic diet was actually shown
6593.64 to be medically relevant for
its use to treat epilepsy.
6599.93 It turns out that in epilepsy,
6602.84 or in particular pediatric epilepsy,
6605.33 that a ketogenic diet and
the shift of brain metabolism
6609.62 to predominantly one in which
ketones are being metabolized
6612.87 rather than more standard
glucose tight metabolism,
6617.72 can greatly reduce the
number of epileptic seizures
6620.82 that these children experience.
6622.78 It's not always the case,
but it's often the case.
6624.357 And so you talk to a
neurologist or a neurosurgeon
6627.36 who's specialized in epilepsy,
6631.35 in particular pediatric epilepsy,
and they'll tell you this,
6634.087 "Oh yeah, the ketogenic
diet, in many cases, not all,
6636.817 "can be very effective
for this treatment."
6638.78 How?
6640.0 How is it that a ketogenic
diet reduces seizures?
6643.64 Well, the way it reduces seizures
6646.42 is by increasing what's
called GABA transmission.
6649.98 GABA is a substance that is
naturally released in our brain.
6654.3 It's an inhibitory neurotransmitter,
6656.4 meaning that when it's
released into the synapse,
6659.01 it has the tendency to reduce the firing,
6661.76 to reduce the electrical
activity of the next neuron
6664.76 or sets of neurons.
6666.97 There are various compounds
that increase GABA,
6669.55 in particular, GABA in the forebrain.
6670.96 One common example would
be something like alcohol,
6674.57 drinking alcoholic drink or two
6676.96 will increase GABA transmission,
6678.99 ironically will lower
your social inhibitions
6683.01 by increasing your
neurochemical inhibition.
6686.01 It basically suppresses the
self-monitoring pathways.
6690.06 And if people drink enough,
6691.03 it will suppress all pathways
6692.247 and people will urinate
themselves and fall over.
6694.88 It will eventually inhibit
all sorts of pathways.
6697.52 So the GABA system has
a rich array of effects
6701.27 all over the brain and body.
6702.96 But alcohol tends to
activate the release of GABA.
6707.19 You might say, well then
why not just take alcohol
6709.55 to suppress seizures?
6710.383 Well, that be a terrible idea
6711.53 because there tends to
be a rebound excitability
6714.17 after alcohol stops having its effects
6717.72 on the GABA receptors.
6718.92 And so then there's an excitability
6720.69 for which an epilepsy would be terrible.
6723.16 The reason why the epileptic
diet is useful for epilepsy
6727.15 is that increases what
we call the tonic level,
6729.627 the sort of the ti, the
level of GABA in the brain,
6733.89 and that suppresses some
of the hyperexcitability,
6736.63 that is the characteristic
feature of epilepsy.
6740.22 And there are other drugs, for instance,
6741.94 the benzodiazepines and
things of the Xanax, variety,
6746.62 Valium, and so forth.
6748.26 Those increased GABA transmission.
6750.13 Those drugs also have a
lot of potential for abuse
6752.67 and addiction, et cetera,
6754.04 and they're problematic for other reasons.
6756.01 But the ketogenic diet,
6758.66 by way of increasing ketone metabolism
6760.95 or shifting brain's
metabolism over to ketones
6764.61 tends to modulate GABA such
that GABA is more active
6770.64 and adjust the so-called
GABA glutamate balance.
6774.04 This is getting technical,
6775.05 but glutamate is an
excitatory neurotransmitter,
6778.1 GABA is inhibitory neurotransmitter,
6779.77 and their balance is
vital for neuroplasticity,
6782.52 for maintaining healthy levels
of activity in the brain,
6785.77 et cetera.
6786.83 And so there is decent evidence
6790.16 that people with major
depressive disorders,
6793.37 in particular, the people with
major depressive disorders
6797.19 that are refractory,
meaning they don't respond
6800.79 to classical antidepressants,
6804.03 can benefit, it seems,
from the ketogenic diet.
6808.86 Now this is not always the case,
6810.27 but for those of you out
there who are struggling
6813.04 with major depression, and for
which drugs have not worked,
6815.1 please talk to your psychiatrist.
6816.41 I don't know how many of
them are up on the literature
6818.4 about the ketogenic diet
or the EPAs and the rest.
6822.9 Psychiatrists vary in
terms of how involved
6825.53 in the current literature they tend to be,
6827.47 but there are many excellent
psychiatrists out there.
6829.92 Most of them in my experience,
6831.6 are actually quite avid
learners about what's happening
6835.677 and what's new in this realm
that they call psychiatry.
6839.29 So it's really interesting that
eating in a particular way,
6843.03 lowering carbohydrates to
the point where you rely
6846.772 on ketogenic metabolism in the brain,
6849.02 increases GABA and can provide some relief
6851.96 for depressive symptoms.
6853.82 And that in particular, that
seems to have positive effects
6856.89 in people that are
refractory or don't respond
6859.27 to classic antidepressants.
6861.07 And that would include things
like fluoxetine, et cetera.
6864.09 I'll make one final point
about ketogenic diets
6866.74 and GABA and depression,
6867.97 which is that it's also been shown
6869.97 that for people that
respond well to these drugs
6874.84 that impact the serotonin
system, dopamine system,
6877.29 or norepinephrine, the ketogenic diet,
6880.21 there may improve the ability
6883.79 for those drugs to work at lower dosages,
6885.62 which is reminiscent of
what we saw with the EPA
6888.01 supplementation.
6889.17 So today we've covered
what at least feels to me,
6891.86 like a tremendous amount of material.
6893.87 This topic of depression
is indeed an enormous topic
6896.56 to try and get our arms around.
6898.2 We talked about the symptomology,
6899.53 we talked about some of the
underlying neurochemistry
6901.227 and biology,
6902.53 and then we talked about
approaches to deal with it
6904.8 that are really grounded in
the neurochemistry in biology.
6908.74 I just want to recap a few of those tools
6911.52 and what those things are.
6913.85 First of all,
6914.683 we talked about making the
effort to not overwhelm
6917.6 the pleasure system.
6919.11 That might seem counterintuitive.
6920.67 To not overly seek out pleasure,
6922.7 or else one can find themselves
in a place of depression.
6926.53 I mentioned way back at the
beginning of the episode,
6929.09 a young man who I know
to be really struggling
6932.76 with depression, and it is thought,
6936.06 and we don't know for sure, but is thought
6938.13 that some of that depression
was probably triggered
6940.21 by an overindulgence in video games
6942.65 and other highly dopaminergic activities
6945.41 to the point where those
activities eventually
6947.65 were countered by the pain balance that
6950.89 Dr. Anna Lembke described.
6952.72 And he now has to do those
activities repeatedly
6957.18 and for many, many hours
each day, just to feel okay,
6960.09 not even to derive pleasure from them.
6962.45 And worse, many other activities,
6966.01 practically all other
activities have lost their zest,
6969.57 they've lost their excitement
and his sense of pleasure
6972.36 for them.
6973.21 And so there's a really
active campaign now
6975.96 to reset that system.
6977.86 So, number one, don't
overwhelm your pleasure centers
6982.06 either through activities or compounds.
6984.11 Might seem counterintuitive,
6985.44 but you're setting yourself up
for anhedonia and depression
6988.59 if you do that.
6989.423 It's not just about addiction that too,
6991.04 but it's also about setting
yourself for anhedonia
6993.58 and depression.
6995.2 How often can you engage
in these activities?
6997.5 Well, that's going to differ
from person to person,
6999.44 everyone's slightly different,
7000.93 but you should really
mind your extreme highs
7003.52 and your extreme lows and
be cautious about those.
7006.31 We'll probably have a Dr.
Lembke on again at a future time
7009.23 to try and get some more
specifics about that.
7011.33 But if you do feel like you
need to reset that system,
7014.7 it really does seem like
a 30 day complete detox
7018.98 from whatever activity
or substance that is.
7021.15 And ideally it doesn't
continue after that 30 days,
7023.9 especially in conditions
of drugs of abuse.
7026.92 Second of all, talks about
the norepinephrine system
7030.14 and how the norepinephrine
system is really deficient
7032.92 in many forms of major depression.
7036.48 And in depression, there is
now more deliberate pursuit
7040.58 of nor epinephrin inducing
activities that are healthy,
7043.12 that aren't adrenaline seeking per se,
7046.3 things like cold showers,
7047.55 things like particular
patterns of breathing
7051.55 that engage and tend
to make us more alert,
7055.32 things like exercise that
will increase our levels
7058.06 of noradrenaline.
7059.18 I'd be remiss if I said
that these activities
7062.07 could completely eliminate
depressive symptoms
7065.37 in people with major depressive disorder.
7066.9 I don't think that's the case.
7067.89 And again, I want to acknowledge
7068.9 that people with major depressive symptoms
7070.94 often don't have the
energy, the willingness,
7074.0 or the capacity to engage
in some of these activities,
7077.16 but things like cold shower,
deliberate cold showers,
7080.04 things like regular exercise,
7082.34 they aren't just feel good activities.
7085.17 They actually engage the
norepinephrine system
7087.5 and keep that system tuned
up and allow us to increase
7090.13 our norepinephrine levels
at will on a regular basis.
7093.06 And their mood enhancing
effects are real effects
7095.67 at the level of neurochemistry,
7097.88 then we talked about EPAs,
Essential Fatty Acids,
7100.23 and it's clear that for most people,
7103.12 getting above 1000 milligrams
7104.94 and probably even closer to
2000 milligrams per day of EPAs
7108.3 can be beneficial for mood,
especially in attempts to treat
7111.87 or offset major depressive disorder.
7114.69 Are there side effects?
7115.64 Well, you need to explore
those for yourself
7117.85 and with your doctor,
7118.683 everyone has a different
health background.
7121.939 For the margins of safety,
7123.24 for most people would
probably be quite large,
7125.92 but for some people that
might not be the case.
7128.54 So definitely check with your physician.
7131.0 We also talked about exercise
and how EPA and exercise
7133.97 on a regular basis can offset
these inflammatory pathways.
7137.18 I want to mention something I've mentioned
7138.63 on a previous podcast,
7139.72 but in terms of keeping the Inflammatone,
7142.16 all these molecules that
create inflammation,
7144.33 and then the inflammation can
limit the amount of serotonin
7147.06 through the pathways we described.
7148.67 In order to do that, it's
also very, very useful
7152.76 to ingest two to four
servings of fermented foods
7156.08 on a daily basis or near daily basis.
7157.96 These are data that were
published by the Sonnenberg Lab
7159.96 at Stanford recently in the journal Cell,
7162.07 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal
7164.29 that ingestion of these fermented foods
7167.64 really keeps the gut microbiome
tuned up, so to speak,
7171.41 well in order to offset
these inflammatory cytokines,
7174.19 keeping inflammation at bay,
7175.81 it just turns out to
be a really good thing
7178.07 in order to keep our mood in a good place.
7180.79 So EPA, exercise, fermented foods,
7182.67 creatine as a potential source
of relief from depression
7185.91 or offsetting, or keeping us
away from major depression
7189.37 or relapse into depression.
7190.88 And then we talked about
the prescription compounds
7193.63 and the compounds that are being used
7195.13 mainly in the course of
studies and of psychiatry
7197.96 and depression, things like
ketamine, PCP, psilocybin,
7200.68 and related compounds.
7201.7 And then lastly, we talked about ketosis,
