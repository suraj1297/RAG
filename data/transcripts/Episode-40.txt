0.32 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
1.94 where we discuss science,
3.102 and science-based tools for everyday life.
9.28 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology
11.765 and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.
15.58 Today, we are discussing grief.
18.35 Grief is a natural emotion
20.02 that most everybody experiences
at some point in their life.
23.753 However, grief is something
25.6 that still mystifies most people.
27.83 For instance, we often wonder
29.54 why getting over the loss
of somebody, or a pet,
33.34 is so absolutely crushing.
36.34 In some cases it's obvious,
37.87 because we had a very close relationship
39.85 to that person or animal,
41.73 but in other cases, it's bewildering,
44.37 because somehow, despite our best efforts,
46.9 we are unable to reframe
and shift our mind
49.91 to the idea that the person or animal
52.79 that at one point was
here, and so very present,
56.01 is now gone.
57.62 Today we are going to discuss
how we conceptualize grief,
60.94 both at an emotional
and at a logical level.
63.97 I'm going to teach you
about the neuroscience
65.86 and the psychology of grief,
67.85 and incredible findings
that have been made
70.36 in just a few key laboratories,
72.76 that point to the fact
74.5 that we essentially map
our experience of people
78.07 in three dimensions.
80.523 I'll just give you a little hint
81.356 of what those dimensions are.
82.73 They relate to space, where people are,
85.47 time, when people are,
88.13 I'll explain what that means,
89.57 and a dimension called closeness,
92.16 and how those three dimensions
93.73 of space, time, and closeness
95.84 are what establish very
close bonds with people,
99.1 and are what require remapping,
101.39 reorganization within
our emotional framework
103.87 and our logical framework,
105.51 when we lose somebody,
for whatever reason.
108.5 Within that understanding,
109.619 I'm confident that you
will have greater insight
112.232 into the grief process.
114.61 And should you ever find yourself
116.32 within the grief process,
117.56 as I imagine most everyone
will at some point,
121.17 you will be able to navigate that process
123.038 in what psychologists and
neuroscientists deem to be
126.23 the most healthy way
of going through grief.
129.25 Indeed, moving through grief
130.48 requires a specific
form of neuroplasticity,
133.38 a reordering of brain connections,
135.93 and also the connections
between the brain and body.
138.76 I'm going to teach you
about all of that today,
140.75 so you're going to learn a
lot of scientific information.
143.0 You will also learn a lot of tools
145.148 that you can put in your kit
147.05 of emotional and really,
emotional physical tools,
150.71 that will allow you to move through grief
152.29 in this healthy way that
I referred to earlier.
155.06 I'll also point out some
of the myths about grief.
157.81 For instance, many of
you have probably heard
159.29 that there are designated stages of grief
161.32 that everybody moves through.
163.08 Turns out that recent
research refutes that idea.
166.344 There are different stages of grief,
168.12 but not everybody experiences all of them,
170.38 and hardly ever does somebody
172.59 move through all of those linearly,
174.21 meaning in the same order.
175.74 I also want to point
out that for many of you
177.85 that are not experiencing
grief in this moment,
180.98 there's an important scientific literature
183.23 that teaches us that
how we show up to grief,
187.09 meaning our psychological
and our biological state
190.64 that we happen to be
in when a loss occurs,
194.32 strongly dictates whether or not we end up
196.47 in what's called complicated
or non-complicated grief.
199.81 And non-complicated
grief is a form of grief
203.11 that is very prolonged,
204.69 and in fact often requires
206.12 that people get substantial
professional help.
208.88 So whether or not you're
experiencing grief that's mild,
211.197 moderate, or very intense right now,
215.16 or whether or not you are not
experiencing any grief at all,
218.696 you're going to learn
scientific information
220.78 and tools that will help you navigate
222.82 through this process that we call grief.
225.35 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
227.13 that this podcast is separate
228.5 from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.
230.92 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
233.13 to bring zero cost to consumer information
235.24 about science and science-related tools
237.18 to the general public.
238.61 In keeping with that theme,
239.69 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
242.5 Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
245.09 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress
covers that have cooling,
247.62 heating, and sleep tracking capabilities.
250.97 I recently started sleeping
252.6 with an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
254.87 and I am so glad that I did,
256.766 because the sleep that
I'm getting is superb
259.93 compared to the sleep I
was getting previously.
261.82 I always thought that I slept pretty well,
263.5 especially since I apply a
number of different tools
265.6 in order to sleep well,
things like supplements,
268.75 things like keeping the
room cool, et cetera.
270.96 But I have had a repeating
problem over the years,
273.77 which is that I would wake up
274.94 in the middle of the night often,
276.5 and sometimes have a bit of trouble
278.247 or a lot of trouble getting back to sleep.
280.29 I would have to apply other tools
281.628 in order to get back to sleep.
284.29 Eight Sleep allows me to
adjust the temperature
286.67 of my mattress and my
sleeping environment,
288.87 so that I fall asleep easily,
290.45 and stay asleep throughout the night,
292.33 which as many of you
know is a game changer.
295.48 Temperature is a powerful
regulator of sleep
297.307 and the ability to get into sleep.
298.82 We know, for instance,
299.85 that the body needs to drop
by one to three degrees
302.76 in order to get into
sleep and to stay asleep.
304.85 And with Eight Sleep,
305.8 I can program the temperature of my bed
307.53 so that it gets cooler as I fall asleep,
310.27 gets even colder as I enter deep sleep,
311.887 and at the transition to REM sleep,
313.97 rapid eye movement sleep, it
can get even cooler if I like.
316.99 I actually like to maintain
the same temperature
318.64 through deep and REM sleep.
319.97 And then it heats up slightly
as I head towards morning,
322.7 because of course heating up of the body
325.38 is one way in which we wake up.
327.387 So I have this nice contour
of cooling and heating
330.011 that puts me through a beautiful arc
332.25 of falling and staying asleep,
333.74 and waking up when I want to.

358.2 Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.
360.48 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
363.61 that analyzes data from
your blood and DNA,
366.44 to help you better understand your body
368.03 and help you reach your health goals.
370.13 I've long been a believer
371.29 in getting regular blood work done,
373.1 for the simple reason
that many of the factors
375.23 that impact your immediate
and long-term health
377.051 can only be assessed from
a quality blood test.
379.97 And nowadays with the
advent of modern DNA tests,
382.87 you can also get insight
into, for instance,
384.9 what your biological
age is, and compare that
387.43 to your chronological age.
388.54 And of course your biological age
389.87 is the number that truly matters.
392.36 One issue with a lot of blood tests
393.84 and DNA tests out there, however,
395.78 is that you get values back
about metabolic factors,
398.57 hormones, and lipids, et cetera,
400.68 but you don't know what to
do with that information.
402.618 InsideTracker solves that problem.
404.76 They have a very easy-to-use
personalized platform.
407.41 It's a website where you can
literally place your cursor
411.34 over a given value,
413.54 say for a hormone or
metabolic factor or lipid,
416.45 and it will tell you what you can do
418.33 in terms of nutrition,
behaviors, and supplementation
420.81 in order to bring those
values into the range
422.76 that are optimal for you and your health.
425.2 Find this immensely useful
and very easy to use.

438.86 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
441.37 ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
442.975 that are the absolute highest quality
445.08 and have extreme versatility
446.84 in terms of what they can be used for,
448.82 and when you wear them.
449.743 What do I mean by that?
451.19 Well, the company was founded
452.39 by two All-American
swimmers from Stanford,
454.58 and their goal was to develop
eyeglasses for performance,
456.99 things like running and
biking and so forth.
458.93 And you can certainly wear
them for those activities.
461.23 And I do wear them for those activities.
463.13 I wear readers at night.
464.97 I also wear sunglasses sometimes,
466.68 when it's very bright out.
469.02 One of the things that's terrific
470.07 about ROKA sunglasses
and eyeglasses, however,
472.11 is that they're not
just designed for sport.
474.07 They have a terrific aesthetic,
475.65 and you can also wear them out to dinner,
478.18 to work, and so on.
479.91 I say this because at least in my opinion,
482.08 a lot of so-called sport eyeglasses
484.36 or high-performance
eyeglasses and sunglasses
487.1 make people look like cyborgs.
488.68 ROKA, the aesthetic is really terrific.
491.19 They're extremely lightweight
and they don't slip off,
493.33 even when you're sweaty.
494.4 So you can indeed wear them on a hot day,
496.76 or when running or cycling.
498.2 They're not going to slip off your face.
499.27 They're so lightweight, in fact,
500.29 that I often forget
that they're on my face.
502.3 If you'd like to try ROKA
sunglasses or eyeglasses,
504.93 go to roka.com, that's roka.com,
507.67 and enter the code Huberman
509.14 to save 20% off on your first order.
511.29 Again, that's ROKA, roka.com,
513.44 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
515.83 Okay, let's talk about grief.
517.56 I just want to remind you that everybody,
520.71 at some point in their
life, experiences grief,
524.13 either mild grief, moderate
grief, or extreme grief,
528.14 and it's somewhat obvious,
but worth stating nonetheless,
531.8 that how intense grief feels,
534.87 and how long it lasts,
536.35 scales with how close
we were with somebody.
539.34 And if you learn that the person
541.75 who works at the coffee shop
542.88 or that you see at the coffee
shop on a regular basis,
544.953 happened to pass away
546.5 or tragically get killed
in a car accident,
548.638 that can be quite upsetting.
550.41 It can be somewhat disorienting to you
552.298 if you, for instance,
just saw them yesterday
554.85 or they seemed perfectly
fine when you saw them last.
559.06 But of course the grief that results
561.0 from the loss of somebody
562.97 to whom you have that level of attachment
565.14 is far and away different
than the level of grief
568.01 that you would experience
569.64 from the death of a very close loved one,
572.09 a sibling, a parent, God forbid a child.
576.14 When that type of loss occurs,
577.95 it's often the case
578.91 that our entire relationship
to life feels different.
582.65 Places and things that at once
brought us joy and laughter
585.78 now bring the opposite.
587.39 They bring us intense
feelings of sadness and loss.
591.02 Psychologists and neuroscientists
592.82 distinguish between complicated grief
594.96 and non-complicated grief.
597.5 They are very similar at the outset.
599.37 One of the fundamental
differences between them, however,
601.5 is that complicated grief,
602.7 which occurs in about one in 10 people,
605.38 is a situation in which grief
607.79 does not seem to resolve itself,
609.76 even after a prolonged period of time.
612.66 Later in the episode, I'll point you
614.03 to the actual tests that are used.
616.47 I've provided links to those
in the show note captions,
619.89 that will allow you to distinguish
621.62 between complicated and
non-complicated grief.
623.9 These arrive through
the important research
626.17 of the world-class grief
researchers that are out there
629.077 and the psychologists that treat grief.
631.61 The important thing to point
out is that grief is a process.
634.61 Like any biological or
psychological event,
636.77 it has a beginning, a middle and an end.
639.28 And I do believe that being able to orient
641.2 in terms of where you are in that process
643.55 can be immensely beneficial,
645.57 not just for predicting how
long it's going to last,
648.14 but in order to conceptualize
the person or animal
651.48 that you lost, in a way that allows you
653.26 to best preserve their memory
654.81 while maintaining your own
functional capacity in life.
658.06 Along those lines, I want to point out
660.03 that grief and depression,
661.9 while they can feel quite
similar in certain ways,
665.14 and have overlapping symptomatology,
667.11 loss of appetite, challenges sleeping,
670.38 crying in the middle of the day
671.56 for no apparent reason, et cetera,
673.48 they are distinctly different processes.
676.14 The modern research
teaches us for instance,
678.33 that grief rarely responds
well to antidepressants,
682.63 whereas depression can often
684.69 respond well to antidepressants.
687.38 Everything we know and
understand about grief
689.28 is that it is a distinct psychological
691.87 and physiological event
694.03 in the brain and body from depression.
696.3 Rather, perhaps the best
way to think about grief
699.31 is that it is actually
a motivational state.
702.48 It is a yearning.
703.58 It is a desire for something,
706.13 and somewhat surprisingly,
707.87 it's not just a desire
to have that person back,
711.11 or to have that animal back.
712.94 You might think, "Well, that's
crazy, of course it is."
715.63 But of course, there are instances
717.46 in which someone passing away
or an animal passing away
720.18 is actually providing
relief for that person,
723.1 because of where they
happen to be in their life.
725.4 Today, I'll teach you about
grief as a motivational process,
728.64 because grief as a motivational process
731.15 really is the way that
scientists and psychologists
734.02 now conceptualize grief, and
the treatments for grief,
737.81 so that people can move
through them effectively.
740.12 As we wade into this important topic,
742.61 I'd like to emphasize
some of the common myths
744.63 and misunderstandings about grief.
746.89 Some of the myths and
misunderstanding arrive
748.93 from the beautiful work
of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,
752.03 a psychologist who wrote the
famous book on death and dying.
755.21 And I should emphasize
that while Kubler-Ross
758.04 was a real pioneer in establishing
760.38 that there are indeed
different stages of grief,
763.36 the modern science, both
psychology and neuroscience,
765.85 point to the fact that not everybody
767.38 experiences all of the stages
that Kubler-Ross defined,
770.65 nor do they move through those
stages in a linear manner.
773.82 Sometimes they're out of sequence.
775.81 I'll just highlight the five stages
777.52 that Kubler-Ross illustrated,
779.17 because some people really
do experience all of them,
782.21 sometimes in the order I'll read them.
783.83 But again, oftentimes they don't.
786.66 The different stages
of grief, very quickly,
788.81 are denial, anger, bargaining,
790.55 depression, and acceptance.
792.54 In the Kubler-Ross model,
793.78 denial is always the first stage,
795.88 and denial is just as it sounds,
797.7 this disbelief, it cannot
be, there's no way,
801.13 a refusal to accept the new reality
803.76 that the person or animal is gone.
806.89 The second stage, anger,
808.72 is one in which the individual recognizes
811.92 that the person is indeed gone,
813.53 or the animal is gone,
815.62 but their body and their mind
go into a motivated state.
820.08 This is important.
820.913 We're going to return
to this idea of grief
822.75 as a motivated state that
involves action plans,
826.298 in more depth as we go further.
828.92 And then the third stage is bargaining,
830.53 what's sometimes called
the negotiating phase,
832.94 this idea that, well,
if I had just done this,
835.88 or if they had just done that,
836.96 or if I had called more,
838.13 or somehow refusing to accept the reality.
842.18 So in a way this can be blended
with denial in thinking,
845.847 "Well, if I just don't think about it,
847.64 it won't be real," this kind of thing.
850.13 So again, stages can be
blended or braided together,
852.95 because emotions are complex, right?
854.75 Even though there are different
stages to this process,
856.59 they can sometimes be melded together.
859.47 The fourth stage of depression
that Kubler-Ross described
862.81 is one of, why go on living?
865.77 Why should I go on living?
867.03 Why should I continue in
this grief-stricken state
870.89 that seems to deprive me
of all the richness of life
873.59 that I experienced when the
person or animal was still here.
876.39 And then the fifth stage is acceptance.
878.89 This internalization,
not just cognitively,
881.69 not just thinking,
882.77 but emotionally that
it's going to be okay,
885.44 that not just this too shall
pass, but that it has passed.
890.27 So again, the five stages of grief
892.91 that Kubler-Ross defined
were immensely important
895.5 as a critical parsing
of the different stages
899.41 that one could move through.
901.19 But unfortunately those five stages
902.87 were sort of taken to be
gospel for a long time.
905.32 And we now know, based on neuroimaging,
908.01 based on more in-depth
psychological evaluation,
910.64 and frankly, more
researchers and clinicians
913.51 moving into this area and observing
915.46 that while much of what
Kubler-Ross described
918.33 does hold true, it's not always the case.
921.0 And in fact, the contour
of the grief process
923.69 actually has a lot of dimensions
925.17 that are not encapsulated
by those five stages.
927.96 There's also a lot of variation,
929.25 depending on whether or not the loss
930.59 is due to old age, disease,
932.64 whether or not there was
suffering prior or not,
935.3 suicide or non-suicide
type deaths and losses,
938.55 and even grief about non-death losses,
942.211 a relationship breakup,
or something of that sort,
945.39 or even homesickness
and things of that sort.
948.1 So I do want to tip our
hats to the incredible work
951.89 of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.
953.66 By no means am I or do other researchers
956.03 try and discount her
incredible contributions.
958.63 But I think nowadays we have
a different and frankly,
961.89 a better understanding of what
the grief process is like,
964.77 and as a consequence, better
tools to move through grief.
968.13 In order to really
understand what grief is
970.54 in your brain and body,
972.01 and how to best navigate grief,
974.3 I'd like you to do an experiment with me.
976.94 For the next five minutes or so,
979.05 I'd like you to at least try to discard
981.78 of all prior notions of grief
984.46 as just a state of sadness.
987.22 I want to acknowledge that it is
988.85 and does involve sadness,
990.94 but for right now,
992.53 let's think about grief
as a motivational state,
995.86 as a desire for something specific.
998.81 In fact, I'd like you to think about grief
1001.48 as an attempt to reach out
1003.8 and get something that you very much want.
1006.35 Imagine yourself extremely
thirsty, for instance,
1009.23 on a very hot day,
1010.93 and a glass of water is
right in front of you.
1014.12 And it's a beautiful,
clean glass of water,
1016.79 and it's completely full,
1018.51 and you so badly want to drink that water.
1021.68 But no matter how intensely you want it,
1025.48 and no matter how hard
you try and reach it,
1027.79 it always shifts just outside your reach.
1031.21 So if you can imagine that,
even just a little bit,
1034.76 you are touching into
the experience of grief.
1037.7 How do I know this?
1039.06 Well, I know this because
brain imaging studies
1042.139 involving what's called
functional magnetic
1044.35 resonance imaging, FMRI,
1046.57 in which you can evaluate
1047.94 which brain areas are
more active than others,
1050.09 according to blood flow,
1051.28 which correlates with neural
activity and so forth,
1053.88 teaches us that the brain areas
1056.13 that are associated with
motivation and craving and pursuit
1060.43 are some of the primary
brain areas and circuits
1063.3 that are activated in states of grief.
1066.46 I'd like to share an
important paper with you,
1068.04 as one of the first to illustrate the fact
1070.07 that grief is not just a
state of sadness and pain.
1074.81 It is indeed a state of
yearning and desire of something
1078.92 that is just outside your reach,
1081.16 and unfortunately will always
be just outside your reach
1084.45 until you remap your relationship
to that person or thing.
1088.76 The title of this paper is
posed first as a question,
1091.66 so that's why I'll read it as such.
1093.19 The title is "Craving Love?
1095.17 Enduring Grief Activates
Brain's Reward Center."
1097.95 And the first author of this paper
1099.3 is Mary-Frances O'Connor.
1100.58 She's a professor of psychology
1102.002 at the University of Arizona,
1104.57 and one of the world leaders
in the study of grief
1108.52 from a neuroscience perspective.
1110.03 With some luck, we'll get her here
1111.16 on the podcast as a guest.
1113.58 Now this paper has several
important features.
1115.88 I'll just highlight a few.
1117.23 One of the features of this
paper that's not surprising
1119.98 is they found that people
who are in a state of grief
1122.81 are in a state of pain.
1123.98 That is, brain areas associated with pain,
1127.08 actual physical pain, are more active
1130.67 than in non-grieving individuals.
1133.74 However, they also found that
people who are experiencing
1136.25 what's called complicated grief
1138.0 showed reward-related activity
1140.52 in a brain area called
the nucleus accumbens.
1142.82 What is reward-related activity?
1144.31 Reward-related activity
is activity of neurons
1148.13 that's associated with
motivational states.
1151.21 And the nucleus accumbens
is a brain center
1153.8 in which dopamine has the effect
1156.17 of creating a motivated state.
1158.7 If ever you thought that dopamine
1160.75 was only associated with feeling good,
1162.95 you hear about dopamine hits,
1164.64 well, this paper and papers like it,
1168.28 firmly tell us that dopamine
is not about feeling good.
1172.01 Dopamine is about placing us into a state
1174.49 of desiring things and seeking things.
1178.53 This is true in addiction.
1180.28 This is true when we're
hungry and we want to eat.
1183.01 This is true when we want to reproduce.
1185.62 This is true in every state
1187.57 in which we are reaching for something
1189.14 outside our immediate ability
1191.38 to give that thing to ourselves.
1193.21 This is very important to understand,
1195.38 if you want to understand grief
1196.76 and how to move through grief.
1198.47 Grief is not just about sadness.
1200.66 It is a state of sadness,
1203.2 hence the activation of brain
areas associated with pain,
1206.35 and it is a state of desire
and reaching for something.
1211.95 And for those of you that
have experienced grief,
1214.64 I think that will resonate with you.
1217.32 In that understanding that
grief is both a state of pain,
1222.82 but also a state of wanting,
1226.04 and in the understanding
that when we lose somebody,
1230.23 either because of breakup
or because of death,
1234.58 or if an animal dies or gets
taken away or is missing,
1240.24 that state of wanting and desire
1242.23 drives an activation state within us.
1245.18 Now, the key thing to understand
1246.36 is that the activation
of those reward centers,
1249.02 and the involvement of dopamine
1251.45 puts us into an anticipatory state,
1254.4 a state of waiting for
something to happen.
1256.88 It also puts us into a state
of action or desiring action.
1261.21 Our body and our mind
1262.91 are what I like to refer to
as center of mass forward.
1266.04 We are seeking how to resolve the craving,
1269.47 even if we know that is impossible.
1272.53 Why do I say that?
1273.42 Well, we understand,
1275.47 also on the basis of
brain imaging studies,
1278.85 and also some studies in animals
1280.48 that I'll describe in a moment,
1282.24 that in order to understand grief,
1284.89 we have to understand how attachments
1286.81 are represented in our brain.
1288.35 And it turns out that both attachments
1291.04 and the breaking of
attachments in healthy ways
1293.87 are governed by three important,
what we call dimensions.
1297.45 A dimension is just some
feature of the world
1300.58 that's represented in our brain.
1302.85 So for instance, the color red
doesn't exist in your brain.
1306.67 You happen to have cells,
neurons, in your eye
1311.69 that respond best to long
wavelengths of light.
1315.63 And those long wavelengths of light
1317.36 happen to be what are reflected off things
1319.95 that are perceived as red.
1322.31 So in your mind, you have a notion of red.
1324.82 I know this is a little bit abstract,
1326.27 but you're not actually
lighting up red neurons
1329.77 in your brain, and that's why you see red.
1332.04 You are lighting up neurons in your brain
1334.3 that represent the presence of red things
1337.74 in your environment.
1339.29 Similarly, we have neurons and maps,
1342.89 or we say representations
of other dimensions.
1345.79 We have dimensions of touch.
1346.93 We have dimensions of sound.
1348.58 And as I'll now teach you,
1350.29 we have three dimensions
that define our relationship
1354.37 to people and animals and things.
1356.83 And when those people, animals and things
1359.46 are within our immediate vicinity,
1362.11 or if we know how we
could access them, right?
1365.73 If somebody's still alive,
1366.66 there's generally some way to access them,
1370.03 unless they're refusing
to interact with us.
1373.12 Well, when we understand that,
1375.4 our motivational states can operate
1378.19 in a way that's logical.
1379.4 We know that, for instance,
1380.44 if we want to find our
mother, brother, sister,
1384.22 significant other, dog,
cat, parrot, et cetera,
1387.53 we have to go through
a certain set of steps.
1390.37 What are those three dimensions
and how do they work?
1393.053 And that's what I'm
going to teach you now.
1394.56 So at risk of sounding a
little bit too reductionist,
1396.87 we are now going to
describe your relationship
1400.54 to anything, everything, and anyone,
1404.37 in these three dimensions.
1406.85 How can we do that?
1408.43 Why would we even want to do that?
1410.73 Why would we want to rob the
complexity of relationships
1414.41 of their contour and their detail?
1417.4 Well, if we can understand the dimensions
1421.14 in which we map our relationship
1423.46 to people, animals, and things,
1426.4 then we can understand why
it is that when those people,
1431.1 animals, or things are
not accessible to us,
1435.1 why it hurts so much,
1437.3 and why it takes a certain amount of time
1439.53 in order to re-understand, if you will,
1442.75 or remap our association to them.
1445.93 I promise that in grasping the information
1448.37 I'm about to give you,
1450.07 you will be able to better
orient in the grief process,
1454.06 and you'll be able to move
through it more effectively.
1457.43 The three dimensions
of relating to someone,
1461.6 or an animal, or a thing,
1463.41 are space, time, and closeness.
1467.24 And in order to illustrate each one
1469.24 and how they work together
to support relationships
1472.81 and their involvement
in the grieving process,
1475.16 I'm going to tell you about an experiment.
1477.73 This experiment was actually done.
1480.07 The experiment involves putting
people into a brain scanner
1483.08 that allows the researcher to evaluate
1485.141 brain activity in different areas.
1487.54 In fact, can look in
a very non-biased way,
1491.05 not make any predictions
about which brain areas
1492.87 are going to be involved.
1494.5 And the experiment is the following.
1497.02 The person, we should
say the research subject,
1500.29 first sees images of things that reside
1503.38 at different distances from one another.
1505.01 And when I say things, these are objects.
1507.61 So in one case it's a
beach or a parking lot
1511.7 with bowling balls set
1513.01 at different distances from one another.
1516.3 Their brain is imaged,
1517.75 and as their brain is imaged,
1520.24 they see different pictures
of different scenes,
1523.35 the beach, the parking lot, et cetera,
1525.38 bowling balls spaced in different ways,
1527.69 close together, far apart,
1529.14 regularly spaced, non-regularly spaced.
1532.18 When one does this sort of experiment,
1533.47 you see a lot of brain areas activated.
1535.78 Not surprisingly, the visual cortex,
1537.48 the area of the brain that is responsible
1539.03 for creating visual perceptions,
1541.85 but also a brain area
that seems uniquely tuned
1546.06 to the distance between
you and the objects.
1550.36 So whether or not the
bowling balls are far away
1552.34 or close together from one another,
1554.85 and whether or not they are far away
1556.66 or close to you physically,
1558.19 so literally the distance
between you and these objects.
1560.97 We'll refer to that measure,
1562.88 that dimension, as we call
it, as proximity, okay?
1565.84 Whether or not it's very close to you,
1567.631 high degree of proximity,
1569.61 or far away, low proximity.
1572.72 But it's simply physical space.
1575.79 Then subjects listened to tones.
1579.2 Those tones also are
spaced from one another.
1582.01 So it could be something as simple as
1584.16 my hand meeting the table top
1587.34 that I'm happen to be sitting in front of.
1588.75 So it's [hand hits].
1592.96 They image the brain.
1593.819 Of course, areas of the brain
1595.59 that are associated with
auditory perception are active,
1598.62 not surprisingly, but as they evaluate
1601.57 different types of sounds
and patterns of sounds,
1604.0 for instance, [hand hits]
1609.03 they can start to parse brain areas
1610.92 that seem uniquely tuned
to the spacing of sounds,
1615.0 independent of what sounds are coming in.
1616.7 So whether or not it's musical notes,
1617.92 or my hand hitting the
table, or human speech,
1620.807 they identified a brain
region that is uniquely tuned.
1625.49 That is, it becomes active
specifically in response
1628.83 to changes in the spacing between sounds,
1631.84 much in the same way as they
could identify brain regions
1634.42 that were only activated
1636.03 when there were changes in
the distance between objects,
1638.93 such as the bowling balls
1640.07 that I used in the previous example.
1642.3 And then the subjects saw
a different set of images.
1645.86 The images that they saw
were of people, and of faces.
1649.66 And some of the images that they saw
1651.41 were of people's faces right up close,
1653.88 and other images were
of people at a distance,
1657.54 where you could see the
whole body of the person.
1659.91 Now, they also varied
1661.72 the emotional relationship
to those people.
1664.29 That is, they were able to get photographs
1666.87 from these research subjects' lives,
1669.13 so they could show them
pictures of, for instance,
1671.15 their sister or some random
person off the street.
1675.09 They could show them pictures of a parent,
1678.52 or of a neighbor,
1680.0 or of a celebrity that's well known,
1682.89 or of somebody that
they didn't know at all.
1685.5 So they were able to vary
1686.97 both the position of the
person, close or far,
1690.481 and they were able to vary
1692.4 the emotional distance to the person,
1694.84 which is this dimension that
I'm referring to as closeness,
1697.53 which is not physical closeness,
1698.98 but how attached, or how
well you know somebody.
1702.58 Now, this is maybe sounding like
1704.31 a somewhat complicated experiment,
1705.67 but the takeaway from this experiment
1707.56 is exquisitely simple,
and exquisitely important.
1712.27 The result was, that in
all three conditions,
1718.73 changes in the physical
spacing of these objects,
1721.84 changes in the temporal,
1724.4 that is, the time spacing of these sounds,
1726.62 and changes in the emotional distance
1729.48 between the subject and different people,
1731.85 the same brain area
was uniquely activated.
1736.07 Now that is an incredible thing to find,
1738.37 because what it suggests is that, yes,
1741.38 of course there are brain areas
1742.41 that are associated with
representation of visual objects,
1745.14 and that yes, of course
there are brain areas
1746.69 associated with representation
of different sounds.
1749.95 And of course, there are brain
areas associated with faces.
1752.17 We now know this.
1753.33 In fact, there's something
called the fusiform face area,
1755.57 which is uniquely tuned to faces.
1758.11 But at the same time,
1760.13 there is a unique brain
region that is activated
1765.055 in all three of the
conditions I described,
1768.22 that has to do with how
far you are from somebody,
1771.11 both in space, in time,
1774.14 and in terms of emotional closeness.
1776.61 And that brain area, it turns out,
1779.37 is a brain area called the
inferior parietal lobule,
1783.19 the inferior parietal lobule.
1784.55 Now, you don't need to know
1785.95 where the inferior parietal lobule is.
1788.55 In fact, you don't even need to know
1789.7 the name of this brain area.
1791.51 What you do need to know, however,
1792.96 if you want to understand grief
1794.35 and how to move through grief,
1796.01 is that your map of people is not a map
1799.87 of emotional closeness per se.
1802.85 It is a map of emotional closeness,
1805.123 what we call attachment,
1807.2 that is interwoven, that is braided in,
1810.69 in a very intimate way, with your map
1813.07 of where they are in physical space,
1816.15 and where they are in time,
1818.32 when you saw them last,
1819.41 when you're likely to see them again,
1821.25 and if you were to want to see them,
1824.84 how much time it would take to reach them,
1826.98 or for them to reach you.
1828.84 Now earlier, I said that
one of the key functions
1831.17 of our nervous system
1832.28 is to be able to make predictions.
1834.56 And so it's somewhat obvious,
1836.98 but nonetheless important
to state and restate
1840.0 that one of the most powerful aspects
1842.28 of our attachments to
people, animals, and things
1846.1 is our ability to predict
what it would take
1848.86 to see them again, and when we
are going to see them again.
1852.34 In fact, we could say that our ability
1855.94 to locate someone, or
an animal, or a thing
1859.56 in space and time, right,
1861.94 where they are and how
long it would take for us
1864.43 to reach them or them to reach us,
1867.06 is a prediction of the requirements
1870.17 to engage in the attachment.
1871.93 In order to illustrate this
at a little bit more depth,
1875.17 let's just do a fill in
the blank experiment.
1877.8 You can do this now in real time.
1879.68 I want you to think of somebody
that you either rely on
1882.9 or that you care about very, very much.
1885.75 And I'll just allow you
1887.45 to fill in the blank on this sentence.
1890.477 "If I want to see blank,"
the person or animal,
1895.137 "I could see them within
blank amount of time," right?
1898.93 If right now you wanted to
see this person or animal,
1901.89 or maybe even a thing,
1903.65 how long would it take you to reach them?
1906.44 Could be a day, could be a second,
1908.93 could be they're right next to you.
1910.12 All you'd have to do is turn your head.
1913.4 Now answer this.
1915.687 "If this person were to travel
halfway around the world,
1922.01 and land in their plane,
1924.47 I would expect to hear from them
1926.26 within blank minutes of them landing."
1929.97 Okay, the answers of this
of course, will differ.
1933.73 Now, I'd like you to answer this question.
1936.337 "If I'd like to find myself,
1938.24 it would take me X amount of time."
1941.41 And of course, if you're listening to this
1942.833 and you're understanding it
and you're of a rational mind,
1946.6 the answer to that should be
zero seconds, instantaneous.
1949.84 You are always able to locate
yourself in space and time,
1952.81 provided you are in the
appropriate state of mind,
1955.65 meaning not asleep, for instance.
1958.62 That last question might
seem somewhat silly,
1961.16 but it's a fundamentally important one,
1963.71 because it illustrates the extremes
1965.24 at which we map our
relationship to ourselves
1967.36 relative to other people and things.
1969.81 Now, if all of this sounds
1970.87 like a bunch of neuropsycho babble,
1975.46 parsing of the obvious,
1977.63 I'd encourage you to suspend
that belief for the moment.
1980.6 Because if you understand
that all relationships
1983.09 are mapped in the brain and body
1984.67 through these three dimensions,
1986.06 space, time, and closeness,
1988.06 or proximity of space, proximity in time,
1992.36 and proximity of attachment,
1995.04 how close or rich or
bonded you are to someone,
2000.23 well, if you can understand that,
2002.75 then it almost becomes obvious,
2005.47 or at least it becomes intuitive,
2007.66 as to why, after the loss of somebody,
2010.04 in particular, a death,
or the loss of an animal,
2013.31 this map has to be reordered.
2015.83 Why, because if we are attached
to someone, or an animal,
2020.86 at a deep level,
2022.64 it is almost always on the basis
2025.01 of a lot of what we call
episodic experience,
2027.76 a lot of episodic memories,
2029.3 memories of things that happen.
2031.33 Episodic memories are literally
2034.08 the conscious recollection of
your experience of somebody,
2037.95 or an animal, or a thing.
2039.93 And within that memory,
2042.53 you have an understanding of
what has happened with them
2046.58 in association to you,
2048.05 what's going on with them,
2049.57 where it happened, when it happened.
2051.86 You have a rich knowledge database
2054.13 that we call implicit knowledge, right?
2056.12 You might not be aware of it all the time,
2057.76 but it's within you, of
what this person is like
2060.27 and what they're doing in their life.
2062.99 When somebody is taken away
from us, for whatever reason,
2067.46 episodic memories persist
for some period of time,
2070.92 and they are still linked to
our feelings of attachment.
2074.45 Grief is the process of
uncoupling, unbraiding,
2078.8 and untangling that relationship
2081.99 between where people
are in space, in time,
2084.197 and our attachment to them.
2086.01 What I mean by this is
when somebody or an animal
2088.51 or a thing is taken from us,
2090.09 either by decision or by
death, or by circumstance,
2095.01 well, in that case, our entire memory bank
2100.65 and our ability to predict
where and when they will be,
2103.92 and therefore when we can feed
our attachment to them again,
2108.44 that whole map is obliterated,
2111.76 except that the attachment
itself has not been disrupted.
2116.24 Assuming that you are
deeply attached to someone
2118.61 or an animal or a thing,
that attachment persists,
2121.61 and the grief process is one
2123.3 in which you have to reorder
your understanding of them
2125.99 in space and in time.
2128.3 This is very, very hard to do,
2130.37 and for some people it's
almost impossible to do,
2133.59 at least at the outset of grief.
2135.61 This, in a very neurosciencey way,
2138.68 explains this stage that
Kubler-Ross described,
2142.03 which many, again, not all,
2143.54 but many people experience,
2144.77 which is one of denial.
2146.57 How could it be, why?
2148.34 Well, when we have a rich catalog
2151.39 of experiences with
somebody or of them, right,
2154.4 ideas about them and what they do,
2155.87 how they spend their day,
2156.74 what they do and don't do,
2157.61 where they do it, et cetera,
2159.3 well, that memory bank
is not just flushed out
2163.77 the moment that we learn that
they're no longer with us.
2167.56 What happens is, the brain continues
2169.45 to make these predictions
2170.73 that they will be in a certain place
2173.12 or a certain time, right,
2174.73 that they'll be in a certain time zone
2175.96 or they'll walk in the door any moment.
2177.89 All of those predictions still hold.
2179.47 The neural activity continues.
2181.03 We call this reverberatory activity.
2184.36 That explains the yearning for,
2186.33 and the desire to interact,
2187.64 and yet it's just beyond our reach.
2189.14 Because once they're gone,
2191.23 our brain still functions in a way,
2194.0 these neural circuits
still function in a way
2196.38 that put us into an action
state of seeking them,
2199.18 looking for them in the same location,
2201.46 expecting them to contact
us at whatever frequency
2204.07 that we were used to hearing from them,
2205.82 or that we could reach out to them
2207.02 and reliably get a response.
2210.66 It is immensely
disorienting, in other words,
2213.84 to maintain a close attachment,
2216.8 and at the same time to not
be able to make predictions
2220.59 about where that person, animal,
2222.87 or thing is in space and time.
2226.01 Now, if this seems somewhat abstract,
2228.03 I'm going to continue to flesh it out.
2229.89 And actually right now,
I'd like to flesh it out
2231.99 with a real-world
example of grief and loss
2234.95 that comes to us from perhaps
2237.33 one of the greatest
minds in human history,
2239.81 and somebody who was intensely grounded
2243.39 in reality and logic, and
indeed the physics of the world.
2247.33 And the person I'm referring
to is none other than
2249.57 the Nobel Prize-winning
physicist, Richard Feynman.
2253.21 Many of you are probably
familiar with Richard Feynman.
2255.48 Some of you perhaps are not.
2256.94 Richard Feynman was a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist,
2259.78 known for his thick New York accent.
2262.46 He was actually not from
Brooklyn, as many people think.
2265.14 He was actually from Far
Rockaway in Long Island.
2269.01 Thick New York accent, very personable,
2273.09 exceptional teacher, brilliant mind,
2275.64 hence the Nobel Prize in physics.
2277.27 Also a quite funny and amusing person,
2279.68 told great anecdotes, et cetera.
2282.69 Feynman had a childhood sweetheart
2285.77 who turned out to be his first wife.
2287.94 Her name was Arline, and it was well known
2290.46 that Feynman was absolutely
in love with her.
2294.24 He would talk about her all the time.
2295.87 She had a profound influence
on him and his thinking,
2298.58 and ultimately on his public
education efforts later.
2301.7 If you haven't already read books such as
2304.237 "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman,"
2306.24 or "What Do You Care
What Other People Think,"
2308.57 I encourage you to do so.
2309.403 And in fact, that quote,
2310.277 "What do you care what
other people think,"
2312.1 is actually a quote, not of Feynman,
2314.4 but of his first wife, Arline,
2316.05 who sadly, died at a very
young age from tuberculosis.
2319.8 Why am I sharing Feynman's story
2322.095 of loss of his first bride?
2324.18 Well, the reason is, Feynman continued
2328.01 to write letters to Arline
for a long period of time.
2330.95 This is well known only
because after Feynman died,
2335.964 it was discovered that he kept an archive
2338.75 of letters to his deceased first wife.
2342.88 And even though he did eventually marry,
2345.61 and in fact had many
relationships with many people,
2348.32 and I think was married twice more,
2349.68 maybe it was once, maybe it was twice,
2352.33 the intensity of his grief,
2354.37 but also his lack of ability
to transition his mind
2360.23 to a place where he understood
that Arline had died,
2363.6 is one of the more profound examples
2366.15 of this inability to reconcile
2368.67 the logical world and the emotional world.
2371.24 And I'm now going to read to you a letter
2374.29 that Feynman wrote to Arline.
2375.91 This was discovered after Feynman's death,
2377.89 when they went through his
desk and his belongings.
2380.98 And as I read this, you're going to hear
2383.7 some of the typical narrative of grief
2385.95 that is not unique to
Feynman and his dead wife,
2390.92 but there are also some elements in there
2393.36 that I think you'll recognize
2395.05 as highlighting this disbelief
and this dissociation
2398.98 between the reality of somebody's location
2401.61 in space and time,
2403.05 and the emotional attachment
that they hold for us.
2405.7 And therein lies the information
2407.42 about how to better navigate grief.
2409.53 So now I'm reading from the letter.
2410.86 This was a letter dated
October 17th, 1946.
2415.83 It's not terribly long, but bear with me.
2418.311 "Dear Arline, I adore you, sweetheart.
2421.97 I know how much you like to hear that,
2423.61 but I don't only write
it because you like it.
2426.06 I write it because it makes
me warm all over inside
2428.45 to write it to you.
2430.22 It is such a terribly long time
2431.69 since I last wrote to
you, almost two years,
2434.57 but I know you'll excuse me,
2435.68 because you understand how I am,
2437.32 stubborn and realistic,
2438.84 and I thought there was
no sense to writing.
2441.9 But now I know, my darling wife,
2443.23 that it is the right thing to do,
2444.53 what I have delayed in doing,
2445.9 and that I have done so much in the past.
2448.26 I wanted to tell you I love you.
2450.04 I want to love you.
2451.31 I will always love you."
2452.98 So here we can hear the
intense emotional attachment
2455.76 that clearly has persisted.
2458.937 "I find it hard to understand in my mind
2460.93 what it means to love
you after you are dead,
2463.52 but I still want to comfort
and take care of you.
2465.94 And I want you to love me and care for me.
2468.72 I want to have problems
to discuss with you.
2470.78 I want to do little projects with you.
2472.86 I never thought until just
now that we can do that.
2475.68 What should we do?
2477.38 We started to learn to
make clothes together,
2479.39 or learn Chinese, or
getting a movie projector.
2482.55 Can't I do something now?
2484.07 No, I am alone without you,
2486.32 and you were the idea woman
2488.01 and the general instigator
of all our wild adventures.
2492.15 When you were sick,
2492.983 you worried because you could not give me
2494.31 something that you wanted,
and you thought I needed.
2498.01 You needn't have worried.
2499.43 Just as I told you then,
2500.52 there was no real need,
2501.44 because I loved you in
so many ways so much.
2503.83 And now it is clearly even more true.
2506.27 You can give me nothing now,
2507.94 yet I love you so that
you stand in the way
2509.96 of my loving anything else.
2511.78 But I wanted you to stand there.
2513.31 You, dead, are so much better
than anyone else alive."
2517.79 So you can really appreciate the depth
2520.75 and intensity of the attachment.
2522.32 Despite two years' time,
it clearly has not waned.
2526.53 I'll read the final paragraph now.
2529.347 "I know you'll assure
me that I am foolish,
2531.53 and that you want me
to have full happiness,
2533.58 and don't want to be in my way.
2535.52 I bet you are surprised
2536.45 that I don't even have a girlfriend,
2537.404 except you sweetheart, after two years,
2540.67 but you can't help it, darling, nor can I.
2542.65 I don't understand it,
for I've met many girls,
2545.13 and very nice ones, and I
don't want to remain alone.
2548.37 But in two or three meetings,
they all seem ashes.
2551.84 You only are left to me.
2553.91 You are real.
2555.44 My darling wife, I do adore you.
2557.57 I love my wife.
2559.08 My wife is dead.
2560.77 Rich.
2562.3 P.S., please excuse my not mailing this,
2565.01 but I don't know your new address."
2568.57 So there's a lot contained in this letter.
2571.13 We could parse it line by line,
2573.29 but I think it's fair to say that clearly,
2574.84 there's an immense attachment
that's been maintained.
2577.09 So that's that dimension
of closeness of attachment.
2580.92 Clearly, there's an
understanding that she's dead.
2582.93 In fact, the last line
of this love letter is,
2586.517 "My wife is dead," right?
2588.67 He now moves her into the
third person, in fact,
2591.168 in that final line.
2593.96 So he understands this,
2595.24 and yet he maintains the attachment.
2597.87 And the very last portion
of the letter, the P.S.,
2601.33 the postscript, "I don't know
your new address," right?
2604.75 Somewhat humorous in the typical vein
2606.92 of a Feynman writing or speech.
2610.02 He always had a intensely amusing
2613.48 and playful sense of humor.
2615.29 And yet there's something
really contained in this.
2617.08 I don't think we're
reading into this too much,
2619.68 in that he doesn't know where to find her.
2621.88 He feels her as very real,
2624.64 and yet he doesn't know where to find her.
2626.75 He doesn't know her address.
2628.48 He obviously knows she's dead,
2629.84 so there's nowhere to mail it to.
2631.92 The reason I shared this letter with you,
2633.39 as opposed to one of the
almost infinite number
2636.3 of other letters that have been written
2638.329 by poets and authors and
scientists and everyday people,
2642.87 is that it really encapsulates
all three dimensions
2646.1 of attachment and grief.
2648.09 These notions of space,
2650.04 where is something or somebody,
2652.3 time, this dimension of,
2654.39 how long would it take me to reach them
2655.95 or for them to reach me?
2657.49 What would it take, in terms
of time, to be reunited?
2661.2 And then that last dimension of closeness,
2663.98 and the letter beautifully
illustrates the fact
2666.88 that, in grief, we maintain
that sense of closeness.
2672.3 And yet we have to uncouple it
2674.47 from these other two dimensions,
2676.65 as we're referring to, space and time.
2679.78 So with this current
understanding in mind,
2682.47 a few things start to become obvious
2684.97 and entirely normal to us,
2687.25 in the best and most healthy
sense of the word normal.
2691.61 For instance, if you've
lost somebody, or an animal,
2695.19 or even a thing that was
vitally important to you,
2698.82 it should make perfect sense to you
2700.21 as to why you keep
looking for that person.
2703.16 I recall this in my own life.
2704.58 I had the unfortunate circumstance
2706.54 of my graduate advisor,
who I was very close with,
2709.33 died quite young of breast cancer.
2712.49 And her daughter, she
actually has two daughters,
2716.66 kept her cellphone and
would occasionally call me.
2719.4 I had a quite close
relationship to their family.
2722.87 And when it would come in,
2724.27 the number would pop up on
my phone of not the daughter,
2728.05 but the name that showed up
was of my graduate advisor.
2730.82 So for years after she
died, my initial impulse,
2734.33 when the phone would ring was,
2735.407 "Oh my goodness, she's calling."
2736.74 It was a reflexive excitement
2738.86 because I truly always
enjoyed hearing from her.
2741.96 She was a wonderful,
2743.7 incredibly wonderful person, I should say.
2746.81 Similarly, when somebody passes away,
2748.78 we will find ourselves looking into a room
2750.6 expecting to see them there,
2752.2 or expecting them to knock
on the door any moment,
2754.52 or to call on Sunday morning, as it were.
2759.63 Those expectations, those predictions
2762.433 that the brain is making,
are entirely normal,
2766.87 because they are based
on that deep catalog
2769.58 of episodic memory that you
maintain about that person.
2772.68 Again, the depth and
richness of that catalog
2775.76 scaling, of course, in direct relation
2778.61 to how close you were
with that person, right?
2780.73 Closer to somebody means
more information about them.
2783.73 More information about them
2784.87 means your brain has a lot of implicit,
2788.02 unconscious notions of when
and where and how they show up.
2793.93 So the fact that your brain,
2795.5 and indeed, sometimes your body reacts
2798.25 to the expectation that they'll
be there is entirely normal.
2802.84 It's simply an activation of this map
2805.333 that involves closeness, space, and time.
2809.72 Not surprisingly, then,
the reordering of that map
2814.43 that's required in order to move through
2816.39 the grieving process,
2818.31 is going to involve some remapping.
2822.097 And you, as the person grieving,
2825.75 have the opportunity to ask
which node as it's called,
2829.15 which element or
dimension within that map,
2832.12 are you going to focus on?
2834.62 Some people really try
hard to disengage with
2838.53 and remap their sense of
emotional closeness to the person.
2841.6 That is, it's so unbelievably
overwhelming to them,
2845.49 that the person is no longer accessible,
2847.63 that they try and change their ideas
2850.48 about how close they really were.
2852.32 They try and change their
emotional attachment to the person
2854.76 after they've died.
2856.06 Clearly in the example that
I gave in the Feynman letter,
2858.97 that's not the case.
2860.828 The attachment seems indeed quite fixed
2861.86 and not going anywhere.
2864.23 Psychologists and
neuroscientists generally agree
2866.52 that the best way to
approach moving through grief
2869.43 is actually to remap these dimensions
2872.74 while maintaining the
close sense of attachment
2875.76 to the person,
2877.2 by not in any way trying to undermine
2880.24 the intensity of the attachment
2881.78 or how important it was to you.
2884.19 So we'll now talk about
how that process works,
2887.37 and the different entry
points, as they're called,
2891.17 to engaging in that process.
2893.26 So one straightforward way to think about
2895.37 this state of mind and
body that we call grief,
2898.77 is that the idea that someone,
2902.01 or an animal, or a thing,
2903.96 simply does not exist anymore
2906.29 is not something that the
brain can easily conceptualize.
2909.92 And the reason for that is that we,
2913.72 as beings that have a brain,
2916.07 and a brain, as an organ
that makes predictions,
2919.81 tends to rely more on
experience than knowledge.
2923.81 In other words, the
knowledge that someone,
2926.84 or an animal or a thing, is
gone, that it doesn't exist,
2929.97 at least not in the dimensionality
2931.428 that we were accustomed
to relating to them in,
2935.92 is something that we can
understand logically,
2939.49 but that emotionally is very hard to undo,
2942.52 and from a memory perspective
is very hard to undo.
2946.87 So it's not just that we are in a state
2948.44 of emotional disbelief.
2950.49 It's that we have neurons,
literally nerve cells
2953.61 and neural circuits,
connections between nerve cells,
2955.77 that are dedicated to this
vast, implicit knowledge
2959.38 of all the things we know
2960.68 about that person, animal, or thing.
2963.01 And just because they are no
longer in the dimensionality,
2967.35 meaning in the configuration,
2970.01 alive or present in our
life that they were before,
2973.39 doesn't eliminate those memories.
2975.27 Those memories persist.
2977.5 And so anytime we call to
mind the person's name,
2981.01 or we call to mind things
that remind us of them,
2984.61 or we suddenly feel the
desire to engage with them,
2989.18 the memories, those
episodic implicit memories,
2992.79 as they're called,
2993.66 all that menu and library of knowledge,
2997.69 slams us straight in the face,
3000.05 and pushes us into a mode
of wanting to act in a way
3004.29 that's consistent with
them still being here
3007.03 in the way that all that knowledge
3008.987 told us they were when we acquired it.
3012.25 That's a very long-winded way of saying
3014.41 that there's nothing wrong
about the emotional state
3017.094 when we are in a state of grief,
3019.66 in fact, quite the opposite.
3021.27 But there is something
wrong about the memories,
3023.58 because the memories are based on
3026.16 our prior knowledge of them,
3028.06 and those memories actually do not apply
3030.95 to our current knowledge of them.
3033.27 And again, even though our
brain is a prediction machine
3036.05 and it's a very good
one, it's not perfect.
3038.54 In fact, it's far from perfect.
3040.24 So really, moving through grief
3041.48 is a process of understanding
3042.837 how relationships are mapped in the brain,
3045.89 space, time, and closeness,
also called attachment,
3049.23 understanding those three dimensions,
3050.65 understanding that they
are closely linked,
3052.84 and then understanding
that simply the knowledge
3055.43 that somebody or something or an animal
3057.29 isn't accessible to us,
3059.39 does not allow us to discard
3062.25 of all the knowledge that we have.
3065.62 And as a consequence,
3066.73 our brain is constantly
generating expectations
3069.72 of how to access them,
3070.81 even if we know that's
completely irrational.
3073.74 Now this should, I would hope,
3077.18 assist you in moving through grief.
3079.41 It's not a tool of the sort of,
3081.96 like a switch that you can flip
3083.27 and suddenly not feel grief,
3084.88 but it does point to a
specific set of mechanisms
3087.6 or a specific set of
steps that you can engage
3090.61 in order to start to move
through the grieving process
3093.76 in the most adaptive and effective way,
3096.5 and in a way that still holds in mind,
3097.333 your close attachment to the person.
3101.37 So let's talk about some of the tools
3102.68 for adaptively moving through grief.
3104.81 These are tools gleaned from
the research psychology,
3107.16 the clinical psychology, and
the neuroscience literature.
3110.32 So I've synthesized my understanding
3112.42 of those three literatures,
3115.22 to provide the tools that
I'm about to describe.
3118.1 The first one involves the acknowledgement
3121.62 and really the understanding
3122.94 that you don't want to
disengage or dismantle
3126.8 your real attachment to
someone, an animal, or a thing.
3130.01 That's a real thing,
3131.01 and there is actually no adaptive reason
3134.03 to try and persuade
yourself or numb yourself,
3137.55 or somehow avoid the thinking
3138.81 of just how much they meant to you.
3141.4 What is important, however,
3142.77 is that you make some
effort to shift your mindset
3146.16 and your understanding of that person,
3148.81 in a way that holds in
mind that yes, indeed,
3151.74 the attachment is very real,
3153.91 and in some cases is very, very intense,
3156.64 but is now going to be uncoupled
3160.36 from the other two dimensions of the map,
3162.64 namely space and time.
3164.52 So again, just to make absolutely clear,
3167.43 there's no reason to try
and convince yourself
3169.94 that you weren't actually
that close to this person
3171.98 or them to you.
3174.06 There's no reason to try
and reduce the intensity
3177.34 of that attachment.
3178.173 To the contrary, you
want to anchor yourself
3180.45 to that attachment, but
you want to make sure
3183.0 that your thoughts about the person,
3185.84 and your feelings about the person,
3187.55 are not oriented toward or in
reference to, I should say,
3191.87 that map, that deep catalog
of memories that you had.
3195.94 Now, this is not simply
a fancy way of saying,
3198.64 don't live in the past.
3200.03 This is saying, you need to maintain
3202.62 your sense of attachment,
3204.34 but you need to start making
predictions and understanding
3208.1 about how you're going to
engage with that attachment,
3211.17 how you're going to feel those things,
3212.7 without the expectation
3215.18 that things that once happened before
3217.5 are going to happen again.
3219.15 So it's a complicated
process, you can imagine,
3221.98 but you really want to hold and
register two things at once.
3224.75 It's sort of like spinning
two plates at once,
3226.47 and therefore it's going
to feel like effort.
3229.46 One way to do this is to set aside
3231.35 a dedicated period of time,
3233.061 of maybe five or 10, maybe
even as much as 30 minutes,
3238.39 or depending on your
capacity, 30 to 45 minutes,
3242.46 in which you are going to feel deeply
3244.04 into your closeness and your attachment
3246.27 to that person, animal, or thing.
3248.6 But you are consciously going to try
3250.86 and prevent yourself from thinking about
3254.276 a couple of categories of things.
3256.69 First of all, you want to
actively try and disengage
3260.83 from any attempt to engage in
3262.67 what's called counterfactual
thinking, the what ifs.
3266.5 What if I had called them a day earlier?
3268.84 What if they had taken
a different route home?
3271.87 What if I had taken a
different route home?
3274.89 These counterfactual modes of thinking
3278.57 are an infinite landscape of possibility,
3281.22 and they are very closely tied to guilt.
3283.87 Guilt is an interesting emotion.
3285.2 We should probably do an
entire episode about guilt,
3287.693 but guilt as defined by
psychologists and neuroscientists
3292.315 is actually a way of assigning
ourselves more agency,
3295.7 more capability of controlling
reality than actually exists.
3299.81 And it's a very slippery slope.
3302.36 And I want to be clear.
3303.59 It's not the case that guilt
3305.17 is never an appropriate response,
3307.21 but in the context of grieving,
3309.63 guilt is very precarious,
3311.04 because in thinking "I
could have done this,"
3313.48 or "if I had only done that,"
3316.83 you are essentially exploring
an infinite landscape
3320.61 of things that you can never refute.
3323.31 You will never know that
had you not gone down
3326.42 a different path or they had not taken
3328.45 a particular path in life,
3330.09 that things would've turned out different,
3331.7 but you can't know that it
would've worked as well,
3335.09 meaning you actually don't know
3336.72 that your what ifs are true,
3338.73 and you don't know that they're not true.
3340.03 And so as an infinite space,
it's a very precarious one,
3342.98 and it will not allow you to uncouple
3346.05 that intense emotional
attachment that I'm telling you
3348.26 is actually vital to hold onto,
3350.15 from that catalog of episodic memory
3353.0 that you've established.
3353.89 In fact, it's going to
strengthen those bonds.
3356.92 So in this dedicated five or 10 or 30,
3360.75 whatever period of time you can
tolerate and maintain focus,
3363.79 the idea is to think about
your attachment in a rich way,
3368.41 and to perhaps even experience
that in your brain and body.
3371.16 I think if you're in a stage of grief,
3372.85 that actually will be
fairly reflexive to do,
3376.17 but to try as much as possible
3377.511 to hold that grief in the present
3380.55 and to be connected to your
immediate physical environment.
3383.96 So you want to orient yourself
in current space and time,
3388.4 rather than focus on memories,
3390.37 or what you would've liked to see happen,
3392.88 or the wish that they were still there,
3394.63 while at the same time,
3395.79 thinking about the depth and
richness of that attachment.
3399.41 This is a obviously a
tightrope walk, so to speak.
3403.19 It's an emotionally challenging,
3404.75 and sometimes even will be experienced
3406.48 as a physically challenging
tool or experience,
3410.57 but in our understanding of
how attachments and grief
3414.31 are represented in the brain,
3415.79 this can be an immensely
beneficial practice,
3418.43 because it is the first step,
3420.21 and indeed, it represents
many of the steps
3423.37 in the voyage from the
initial shock of loss,
3427.48 to our ability to hold in mind somebody
3430.4 or an animal or a thing in
a way that still allows us
3432.74 to feel the depth and fullness
of connection to them,
3435.86 without feeling the yearning,
3437.28 that reaching for the glass of water
3439.44 that unfortunately will never be resolved.
3442.13 Keep in mind that as you
embark on this process,
3445.09 it is entirely normal
for your mind to flip
3447.37 into various states of expectation
3450.24 that they're suddenly going to be there.
3451.27 In fact, because of the closeness
3453.48 of these three dimensions in the map,
3455.35 space, time, and attachment,
3457.99 it's entirely normal that
when you start to think about
3461.26 your attachment to somebody,
3463.36 or an animal, or a thing,
3464.63 that you almost start to experience them
3466.87 as present in that environment.
3468.99 I'll share with you a somewhat bizarre,
3471.08 or it sounds bizarre
to articulate out loud,
3473.07 but many of you perhaps
will resonate with this.
3475.96 For years after my graduate advisor died,
3478.89 I would get an experience of someone
3480.11 touching the back of my neck
when I would think about her.
3483.37 And that was not an experience
I ever had with her, right?
3486.65 It was a professional relationship.
3487.93 I don't ever recall her touching me
3489.3 on the back of my neck,
3490.278 or me touching the back of
my neck in her presence,
3492.777 at least not on any regular basis.
3495.76 So it was very perplexing to me.
3497.8 And then I encountered this
incredible literature on grief,
3501.15 which said the following.
3503.327 "Grief in many ways is
like a phantom limb."
3506.87 For those of you that aren't familiar,
3508.86 many people who experience
amputation of a limb,
3511.411 either through surgery
or accident or otherwise,
3515.16 will feel in a very genuine way
3516.93 that the limb is still present,
3518.29 even though when they look
for the limb, it's not there.
3521.13 So they can feel pain in limbs.
3522.68 They can feel the sensation of touch.
3525.16 There's some famous experiments
from the neurologists
3527.14 and my former colleague
3528.44 at University of California, San Diego,
3530.003 who goes by his last name, Ramachandran.
3532.42 Some people just call him Rama.
3534.65 He's an incredible scientist,
3536.41 and has done a lot of
really important work,
3538.184 in particular on phantom limb,
3540.35 among other things,
3541.77 and has done some beautiful experiments
3543.135 showing that people who
have phantom limb pain
3547.12 or that are experiencing
different sensations
3550.02 in their phantom limb,
3550.853 that can be very intrusive,
3551.82 much in the same way
3552.69 that expecting someone
to walk through the door,
3556.21 who you happen to know is deceased,
3558.83 can be very intrusive.
3560.49 Ramachandran's done beautiful experiments,
3562.73 showing that if you give people
3564.2 what's called a mirror box,
3565.41 this is a box in which
you insert an intact limb,
3569.29 and there are some mirrors
3570.19 that give you the visual impression
3571.612 that the other limb is still present,
3573.72 and you move the intact limb
3575.28 and you get a mirror
image of the non-existent,
3578.76 but nonetheless a visual image
3580.39 of the phantom limb moving,
3582.32 that you can resolve some of the pain
3583.91 of a limb that feels otherwise cramped up.
3586.02 In other words, the visual perception
3588.1 can reverse some of
these phantom sensations.
3591.49 In many ways, the phantom limb scenario,
3594.43 and what I described about a sensation
3596.92 of being touched on the back of the neck,
3598.42 or this feeling that we have
3599.84 when we engage in the thinking
3602.2 and the emotions of our
attachment to someone,
3604.5 an animal, or a thing is very
much like a phantom limb,
3607.53 only it exists in the emotional space,
3610.07 and it exists because it is reactivation
3613.083 of these maps about
space, time, and person.
3618.06 And so if the process
of moving through grief,
3620.45 adaptively in a healthy way,
3622.53 involves maintaining the attachment,
3624.24 but uncoupling that attachment
3625.6 from the space and time
representation of that person,
3628.52 animal, or thing that we had before,
3631.03 well, then the question becomes,
3632.81 where should we place our
expectation of them, right?
3637.04 Now, that of course will
vary from person to person.
3639.813 Some people with particular
religious beliefs
3642.37 will indeed believe that
the soul of the person,
3646.84 the molecules of the person
3648.06 have been reordered and exist in some sort
3650.05 of either distributed domain, right?
3652.1 That they are in everything,
3653.2 or they are in one location.
3655.14 I'm not here to speak to
that one way or the other.
3658.36 There's no good experiment I know
3659.93 either to prove or disprove that,
3662.17 nor would I want to.
3663.81 It's not the job of science, frankly.
3667.24 However, allowing
ourselves to place notions
3671.54 of where that person, animal, or thing is
3676.12 in their current new configuration,
3678.69 whatever that might be,
3679.97 ashes to ashes, dust to dust,
3681.51 or that the person's soul
comes out of their body.
3683.41 These are all the different
variations that people hear.
3685.26 Or some people think,
"Well, it's just molecules
3687.39 and they disintegrate and are reordered,
3688.86 and come up as the plants and the trees."
3690.284 Again, a near infinite
number of possibilities,
3694.31 and it depends a lot on personal belief.
3698.86 It is, however, essential
3699.929 that no matter what you believe,
3702.36 that you have some firm representation
3705.56 of where that person, animal, or thing is
3708.02 so that you can plug it into this map,
3711.07 this three-dimensional map of
space, time, and attachment.
3716.23 The process of moving through grief
3717.59 can't simply be that we
hold onto the attachment
3719.95 and we discard with any understanding
3721.8 of where they are in space and time.
3723.43 And actually, the letter
that Feynman wrote
3725.79 to his deceased wife Arline,
3728.47 again, so beautifully
3730.23 and really poignantly illustrates the fact
3733.11 that he doesn't really
know where to find her.
3735.26 On the one hand, he really
understands that she's gone.
3737.91 And on the other hand,
3738.743 he understands that he
still very much expects her
3741.68 to be there, that he would
like to mail the letter.
3743.96 But then of course, in this final,
3746.56 somewhat humorous line,
3749.4 he doesn't know where to
send the letter, he tells us.
3752.31 What's very clear, and
I think is very healthy,
3755.6 is the fact that the
emotional bond is still there,
3758.86 that that is maintained.
3760.27 And so this tool, if you will,
3763.12 of dedicated blocks of time
3764.3 for really spending some effort,
3767.21 and it is indeed effort
3768.33 to access the emotional connection
3769.92 while starting to uncouple the other nodes
3772.04 of the map, as it were,
is something that is hard.
3776.42 You should expect it to be hard,
3778.44 but in terms of the options one has
3780.71 in order to deal with grief,
3782.59 it is indeed the most
adaptive way to go about it.
3786.16 You're not trying to
avoid thinking about it.
3788.54 You're not engaging in this
counterfactual thinking,
3791.25 the what if, what if, what if.
3793.19 You're not drowning it out with substances
3795.56 or delusion or with other
ways of distracting yourself.
3801.15 So in that sense, it is truly adaptive.
3803.26 Now, of course, I don't want to imply
3804.75 that I'm a clinical psychologist.
3806.68 I'm certainly not.
3807.9 There is absolutely a place
3809.33 for working with a trained professional
3811.06 to move through grief,
3811.96 especially these situations,
3814.27 these one in 10 people
3816.515 who deal with what's
called complicated grief,
3819.42 or very prolonged grief.
3820.88 Those are somewhat different things,
3821.93 but in general, point to the fact
3823.49 that there are people who have
3824.47 an exceptionally hard
time moving through grief.
3826.93 We'll talk about who those people are
3828.85 and ways to move through them,
3830.05 with or without a
professional to assist you.
3833.98 But nonetheless, we're
starting to understand
3836.76 on the basis of neuroscience,
3839.42 what some of the more adaptive
3840.62 and functional ways of
moving through grief are.
3842.88 In order to really understand how a tool
3845.51 of the sort that we're describing to work,
3848.43 and what it's designed to
accomplish at a mechanistic level,
3853.65 I'd like to teach you
3854.483 about a very important
aspect of your brain function
3857.73 that has everything to do with grief
3859.96 and the process of moving through grief,
3862.07 but has a lot to do
3863.65 with other aspects of our
life experience as well.
3866.92 Some of you are probably familiar
3868.07 with a brain area called the hippocampus.
3870.09 The hippocampus is a
structure that's involved
3872.3 in the formation of new memories,
3873.87 but not the maintenance of memories.
3878.36 I discussed the hippocampus in detail
3879.94 in our episode on memory,
3881.32 and our episode with our guest,
3883.6 Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New York University,
3885.67 an expert on learning and memory.
3888.83 During those two discussions,
I did not however,
3891.19 touch into what the
different cell types are
3893.72 in the hippocampus, and the
different roles they perform.
3896.65 And it turns out that there are indeed
3898.45 different cell types in the hippocampus,
3899.93 and they perform very different roles
3901.64 that are absolutely central
to the grief process.
3905.7 We have cells in our hippocampus,
3907.76 meaning you have cells
in your hippocampus.
3910.59 These cells are neurons,
3911.423 nerve cells that fire any time,
3914.68 or, and when we say fire,
I should just remind you,
3917.45 I mean, have electrical activity,
3920.93 any time that we enter a
particular familiar location.
3925.59 So for instance, think about your bedroom,
3928.33 and think about where the bed is.
3931.0 As you're doing that,
3931.97 these so-called place cells are firing,
3934.6 not necessarily to represent
3936.47 that it's a bed at that location,
3938.17 but to represent the location itself.
3941.21 We also have neurons in our hippocampus
3943.61 and elsewhere in our brain, I should say,
3945.68 that represent proximity.
3948.38 So for instance, if you were to wake up
3949.65 in the middle of the night
3950.483 and walk into the kitchen,
3951.76 and it's somewhat dark,
3953.39 and you orient toward the sink
3954.88 to get yourself a glass of water,
3956.26 or to the refrigerator to get yourself
3958.399 something to drink or to eat,
3962.1 as you get close to the
sink or the refrigerator,
3966.1 there are neurons in your hippocampus
3967.67 that are going to start
engaging electrical activity,
3970.75 because you are in the
mirror expected proximity
3974.09 of the sink or refrigerator,
3975.21 and you know where they are,
hence the word expected.
3978.95 Now that all seems fine and good.
3980.43 You've got neurons that
represent where things are,
3983.02 and it sort of goes without saying
3984.97 that those same neurons map
to our emotional attachments.
3989.52 We generally know where
to find our loved ones.
3991.84 Even if they don't live with us,
3993.52 we generally know what city they're in.
3995.78 Even if they're traveling,
3996.7 we generally have a sense
of where they're traveling
3999.11 or the general area in
which they're traveling.
4001.9 Place cells and proximity cells
4003.47 are involved in that kind of mapping
4004.97 and representations as well.
4006.96 Now there's a third kind of cell
4008.16 that's particularly important
for the sort of tool
4010.97 that we were talking about earlier,
4012.41 that tool of holding on
4013.5 to the emotional attachment to somebody,
4015.56 and yet trying to deliberately
remap our understanding
4019.4 of where they are in space and time.
4022.02 And that has to do with
a category of cells
4024.66 called trace cells.
4026.65 Trace cells were discovered
by a number of laboratories.
4029.45 I think the most renowned of
those is the Moser Laboratory.
4033.03 The Mosers are a couple.
4034.83 Actually, they were a couple.
4035.95 They're now, I think, amicably
separated or divorced.
4039.94 That's not what this episode's about.
4041.42 If I have that wrong, forgive me.
4043.203 Edvard and Britt are their names.
4046.288 Their relationship isn't what's important,
4048.41 except what is important
4050.043 is the work that they did
together in one form or another,
4053.33 which was very important work,
4055.18 establishing this category of cells
4057.13 not just in the hippocampus,
4058.7 but in an area of the brain
called the entorhinal cortex,
4060.7 that acts as a sort of coordinate system,
4063.09 to orient us in space and time.
4066.29 Trace cells are activated
when we expect something
4070.86 to be at a given location,
but it's not there.
4075.03 Experiments done in their laboratory
4076.7 and in other laboratories
have shown that, for instance,
4080.47 if you give a rodent or frankly, a person,
4084.83 a object that always resides
at the same location,
4089.24 and we reach to it in order to access it,
4092.7 let's say where your
coffeemaker is in the morning.
4097.24 I do a pour-over coffee.
4098.43 If I'm drinking coffee or
latte, I'll do a pour-over.
4101.24 It's always more or less
in the same location.
4103.97 And so there are place
cells and proximity cells
4106.92 that relate to my being able to find
4108.158 that pour-over coffee cone thing.
4112.58 However, if I were to go to that location
4114.77 and it wasn't there, the trace cells,
4118.56 these neurons in my hippocampus
4120.29 and in the entorhinal
cortex and elsewhere,
4122.4 'cause again, these cells are connected
4123.59 by way of circuitry,
by way of connections,
4126.67 those trace cells would fire.
4128.18 We could even call it a trace circuit.
4129.93 It's a circuit that has an expectation
4132.58 that something will be in a location.
4133.92 But when something is
not at that location,
4136.61 this circuit becomes active.
4138.32 This is important because
what we're talking about here
4140.26 is a neural circuit and a set of neurons
4142.91 that are responsible, not for
the presence of something,
4145.25 but the absence of something.
4148.87 We have every reason to believe,
4150.11 based on neuroimaging studies
4151.51 and studies in animal models,
4153.33 that trace cells become very
active in the immediate stage
4156.969 after the loss of a loved one,
4160.9 that the brain and our
maps of the person, place,
4165.67 or thing that we know cognitively,
4168.22 we understand, we even
believe they are gone.
4171.85 They are not accessible
for whatever reason,
4173.94 death or otherwise.
4175.57 And yet we have neurons that are firing,
4179.21 to reveal that absence to us.
4181.43 And these neurons are closely associated
4185.1 with neurons that tell us
where things ought to be.
4188.93 So if you feel the expectation,
4191.38 or you sense that somebody
4193.11 should walk through the door any moment,
4194.51 or call at any moment,
4195.78 or be next to you when you wake up,
4197.62 and yet you cognitively
understand that they won't,
4200.9 that there's no real
reason why they should,
4202.54 because they are indeed
gone, you are not crazy.
4206.18 In fact, it's simply a reflection
4209.05 of the normal functioning
of these trace cells
4212.54 and trace circuits.
4213.77 Now I'd like to consider why two people,
4216.05 both who are intensely attached
4219.71 to a person that is no longer there,
4222.99 can experience the grief
of the loss of that person
4226.33 in such different ways.
4227.92 This is often observed.
4229.26 You can have, God forbid,
4232.47 incredibly sadly, in cases
where a child is lost,
4235.52 where both parents are grieving intensely,
4238.76 but one seems to feel it at
a emotional depth and level
4242.4 that seems distinct from the other.
4244.05 Now of course, keep in mind
that we never really know
4248.04 how other people are feeling.
4249.53 This is something actually that was raised
4251.05 in the episode where I
interviewed a psychiatrist
4254.71 and researcher colleague of mine
4255.92 from Stanford, Karl Deisseroth.
4258.94 As a psychiatrist, I heard him say once
4261.963 that we really don't know
how other people feel.
4264.82 In fact, a lot of times
we don't even really know
4266.61 how we feel, or at least describing that
4268.3 is quite challenging with language, often.
4271.95 And indeed that is the case.
4273.02 We don't really know
how other people feel.
4275.35 There's no clear way of knowing
4277.45 that the expression someone else has
4279.91 or whether or not they're crying or not,
4281.42 or their body language really represents
4283.71 how they feel inside.
4284.76 So that is important to keep in mind.
4287.13 Nonetheless, there does seem to be
4289.56 a sort of a split among people,
4292.74 and indeed, among animals as well,
4295.46 even within a species,
4297.09 in terms of how intensely they feel
4299.37 the yearning aspect of grief.
4302.66 And it appears, based on a number
4304.84 of different lines of evidence,
4306.14 that that relates to this molecule
4307.96 that some of you have probably
heard of, which is oxytocin.
4310.75 Oxytocin is a hormone slash peptide.
4314.21 A peptide just means a protein,
4316.29 generally a small protein,
4318.15 and a hormone is generally something
4320.59 that functions at numerous
locations in the body
4322.85 to impact numerous organs
and areas of the brain.
4325.75 So a peptide can be a hormone,
4327.49 and a hormone can be a peptide.
4328.71 They are not mutually exclusive.
4330.24 Oxytocin has a variety of
roles in the brain and body.
4333.74 It's involved in milk
letdown during lactation.
4336.6 It's involved in pair bonding,
both in males and females.
4339.8 It's involved in bonding
of parent to child,
4342.31 and indeed, between romantic
partners, et cetera, et cetera.
4347.53 Let's talk about some of the animal models
4349.13 that inform us about the
potential roles of oxytocin
4351.9 in the grieving process.
4354.43 There's a species of animal
called the prairie vole,
4357.2 and believe it or not,
4358.04 the prairie vole has been
studied fairly extensively
4360.99 by neuroscience and
psychology researchers.
4364.14 In fact, our former director
4365.83 of the National Institutes
of Mental Health, Tom Insel,
4369.22 his laboratory focused quite
heavily on prairie voles.
4372.77 Prairie voles are one species of animal,
4374.61 but depending on where they live,
4376.81 you find that some prairie
voles are monogamous.
4379.89 That is, they mate with the
same prairie vole for life.
4384.96 They raise litters of little
prairie voles for life,
4389.13 and other prairie voles,
4390.712 generally that live in
different locations in the wild,
4394.44 are non-monogamous,
sometimes called polygamous.
4399.44 The neurochemical and circuit basis
4402.02 for this monogamy versus
non-monogamy, quite interesting.
4407.61 However, in the context
of grief and attachment,
4409.79 the prairie voles have taught us a lot,
4411.81 and they've taught us a lot
4412.67 through the following experiment.
4414.56 You take two prairie
voles that are coupled up.
4417.09 So these would be
monogamous prairie voles,
4419.56 that have established a couple bond.
4423.13 I guess you would call
that at a prairie voledom.
4425.68 Anyway, you put them in a cage together.
4428.17 They mate together, they
raise young together,
4430.82 and then you separate them.
4433.91 You literally put a physical barrier
4435.48 between the two of them,
4436.85 and you can evaluate how strongly
one prairie vole will work
4442.14 to get access to the
other prairie vole, right?
4444.93 This is sort of the "Romeo and Juliet"
4446.903 of prairie vole experiments.
4450.25 And what you observe is that
the monogamous prairie voles
4453.85 will work very hard to
get back to their mate,
4456.42 to get access to their mate.
4457.55 They will lever press.
4458.81 They'll even walk across a metal plate
4461.62 that they get a electrical shock.
4463.76 They'll work very, very hard.
4465.45 They will cross rivers
and valleys, if you will,
4468.95 in the experimental context, that is.
4472.27 The polygamous prairie voles,
4476.12 and again, we don't know
if they are polyamorous.
4478.32 We don't know what they feel, right?
4480.03 We don't know if they're in love
4481.04 or if they're motivated
simply for other things.
4483.9 But the non-monogamous prairie
voles will not work as hard
4488.6 to access a prairie vole partner.
4492.57 Now you could argue
that's because they expect
4494.96 that there will be other
prairie vole partners,
4496.49 but even if they've never experienced
4497.77 another prairie vole partner,
4499.18 they won't work quite as hard to get back
4502.06 in connection with this
other prairie vole,
4504.79 to mate or otherwise.
4506.77 This turns out to be interesting,
4508.63 when you start to explore the patterns
4510.92 of so-called oxytocin
receptors in the brain.
4514.71 To make a long story short,
4515.95 and to also bridge to
the human literature,
4519.62 it turns out that the
monogamous prairie voles
4523.11 have far more oxytocin
receptors in this brain area
4526.56 that I mentioned earlier,
the nucleus accumbens.
4529.22 And again, to remind you,
the nucleus accumbens
4531.32 is the brain area
associated with motivation,
4533.88 craving and pursuit.
4535.67 So it's as if the monogamous prairie voles
4539.02 have a capacity to link
the attachment circuitry
4544.2 and the molecules of attachment,
4545.75 in this case, oxytocin,
4547.47 to reward pathways and
to motivational pathways.
4551.82 Polygamous, or we should say,
4553.02 non-monogamous prairie voles, do as well.
4556.8 However, they have less
oxytocin receptors.
4559.74 So in other words,
non-monogamous prairie voles
4563.29 seem to have less yearning
for attachment overall,
4566.62 at least to a single
individual prairie vole.
4569.6 And when we look at the human literature,
4571.74 in terms of oxytocin receptor expression
4574.39 and brain imaging experiments, and so on,
4576.74 what you find is the same,
4578.32 that people that experience intense grief,
4580.97 and a deep yearning and a motivation
4584.11 to reconnect with the person, animal,
4587.13 or thing that is lost,
4588.75 in many cases have heightened levels
4591.47 of oxytocin specifically,
4593.81 or I should say, oxytocin
receptors to be exact,
4596.78 specifically within the brain regions
4598.67 associated with craving and pursuit.
4601.52 So for those of you that find yourself
4603.14 in this kind of stuck mode,
4605.69 this persistence of trying
4607.97 to reach into the past
or wishful thinking,
4611.42 this counterfactual thinking,
4613.817 "if only, if only, if only."
4617.09 You don't necessarily want
to pathologize that thinking.
4619.21 First of all, we should acknowledge
4621.09 that it's not necessarily adaptive.
4622.79 And in fact, in the
complete loss of somebody,
4625.02 or if somebody says
they don't want anything
4626.47 to do with you ever again,
4627.901 by all means, you know, if
that's expressed clearly,
4630.7 then you need to accept that reality.
4633.61 But the yearning, the
desire, and the impulsivity,
4637.13 that kind of leaning in
at a almost reflexive way,
4641.67 to try and access that person again,
4643.24 to text them, to want to
hear from them, could,
4645.94 and I have to highlight,
could reflect the fact
4648.4 that you just so happen to
have more oxytocin receptors
4651.43 or maybe more oxytocin
overall in this brain area
4655.27 that's associated with
motivation and pursuit.
4658.36 It does not necessarily mean
4659.76 that you are more capable of attachment
4661.68 than people who move
through grief more quickly.
4664.9 And I should say that
people move through grief
4667.87 at different rates.
4668.703 Even if two people lost the
same person, or same animal,
4672.32 people move through
this at different rates.
4673.8 And some of that is no
doubt psychological,
4676.88 but some of it, no doubt,
4678.07 is also neurochemical and biological.
4681.66 And in sharing this with you,
4682.87 I hope it sheds some understanding
4685.09 and perhaps even some
compassion for people
4688.57 who are moving through things more quickly
4690.32 or in a different way.
4692.03 And of course it should
also, I would hope,
4695.11 shed compassion and understanding
4697.28 for people that seem incapable
of quote unquote moving on.
4701.4 It's taking them far longer to move on.
4704.1 Earlier, we talked
about complicated grief,
4706.36 non-complicated grief, and
prolonged grief disorder.
4709.37 And I should say that
the precise divisions
4711.65 between these categories
is not very precise.
4716.21 It takes a really trained expert
4717.96 to be able to identify whether or not
4719.5 somebody is in the prolonged
grief disorder category,
4722.66 complicated or non-complicated grief.
4725.1 There's actually a set of questionnaires
4726.88 that I invite you to answer if you like.
4729.66 They were provided, or I
should say I accessed them
4732.61 through a public site on
Mary-Frances O'Connor's webpage.
4736.7 We'll put them in the show note captions.
4738.51 You actually can submit those
answers in an anonymous way
4740.93 to a study that she's doing.
4742.78 She has several surveys,
4744.61 one for loss of a romantic relationship,
4747.37 other for loss due to death of somebody,
4751.22 and still another one that
relates to homesickness,
4753.81 and it's also available in
several different languages.
4755.96 So I'll provide a link to that website.
4758.24 It's very easy to download.
4759.21 There's no cost to that at all.
4760.69 You can contribute to the scientific
4761.978 data collection process, if you like.
4764.14 And I do believe that
you get your scores back
4766.76 or an interpretation of your
scores by participating there.
4771.82 When Mary-Frances O'Connor
hopefully comes on the podcast,
4774.35 she can tell us some more of the detail
4776.0 about separating out this
prolonged grief disorder,
4778.9 complicated and non-complicated grief.
4780.77 But in the meantime, it's very clear
4784.19 that people move through
grief at different rates.
4786.38 And as I mentioned just a moment ago,
4788.23 that this is entirely normal,
4789.69 probably has a basis in neurochemicals
4791.78 and hormones, such as oxytocin.
4794.93 There are probably other reasons as well.
4796.21 In fact, we can assume
with almost certainty
4798.76 that there are other reasons as well.
4801.17 Nonetheless, I think
it is really important
4803.38 to think about why some people
might have a harder time
4806.73 moving through grief due
to life circumstance,
4809.87 innate differences, and so on.
4813.02 There's a very nice set of studies,
4815.31 but one in particular,
4816.72 entitled "Catecholamine Predictors
4818.6 of Complicated Grief Outcomes."
4820.96 Here again, the first author
is Mary-Frances O'Connor,
4823.83 reminding us that she's done
4824.85 so much important work in this area.
4827.56 This paper has several conclusions,
4829.96 but one of the key conclusions
4831.99 is that this particular
category of molecules
4833.82 we call the catecholamines,
4834.96 the catecholamines include epinephrine,
4837.35 which is also adrenaline,
4838.48 norepinephrine, which is noradrenaline,
4840.35 and dopamine, which you've
learned about before.
4844.42 Here, I'm just going to paraphrase,
4846.25 or I'll read directly, actually.
4848.22 What they found was that "participants",
4850.42 again, this is human subjects,
4851.757 "with the highest levels of epinephrine,
4853.89 of adrenaline, pre-treatment,
4856.39 had the highest levels
4857.27 of complicated grief
symptoms post-treatment,
4860.04 and that could account
4860.94 for their baseline level of symptoms."
4862.44 What this means is that people
4864.1 that have a lot of circulating adrenaline,
4865.87 we might even call these people,
4866.993 people who are, or typically reside
4870.24 at a higher level of
autonomic arousal, right?
4873.2 We have an autonomic nervous system
4874.46 that dictates how calm
or alert or stressed
4877.64 we happen to be just at baseline.
4879.26 People who tend to be more
alert and anxious at baseline,
4882.3 prior to any grief episode,
4884.148 tend to have, or statistically on average,
4887.65 we should say, are more
likely to experience
4890.72 complicated grief and maybe
even prolonged grief symptoms.
4894.03 So if you're somebody that is
anticipating losing someone,
4898.73 or an animal, or a thing at some point,
4900.35 and I think that really means everybody,
4902.88 utilizing tools to
adjust your epinephrine,
4905.96 your adrenaline levels down
4907.95 has a number of important benefits,
4909.46 improving sleep, health
metrics, et cetera.
4912.04 There are tools to do that.
4913.18 We have an episode on mastering stress
4915.15 that you can find at our
website, hubermanlab.com.
4917.827 It has a lot of behavioral tools
that are backed by science,
4921.16 some of work that was
done in my laboratory,
4922.92 but certainly other laboratories as well,
4925.61 that will allow you to control
4928.5 your autonomic nervous
system, both in real time,
4930.71 and reduce the overall level of stress
4933.357 and even chronic activation
4935.61 of the so-called sympathetic arm
4937.22 of the autonomic nervous system,
4938.28 which is just fancy geek speak for saying,
4940.49 there are tools to help you be calm,
4942.54 not just for sake of
navigating daily stress,
4944.83 but as this paper illustrates,
4947.39 for anticipating the
fact that at some point,
4950.12 you will lose somebody,
an animal, or a thing,
4952.87 and there is a way to
move through that process
4955.95 that we call healthy, normal grieving.
4957.85 And then there's the
so-called complicated grief,
4959.85 or prolonged grief disorders,
4961.89 that reflect immense challenge
4964.41 in moving through grief
at a reasonable rate.
4967.4 So you can somewhat inoculate yourself
4971.04 against complicated or prolonged grief,
4973.28 by reducing your resting levels of,
4976.16 or your pre-loss levels of
epinephrine, of adrenaline.
4980.4 And again, there are
excellent tools to do that.
4982.33 I won't review them here for sake of time,
4983.88 but they're time-stamped,
4985.14 and you can access those easily.
4986.83 Again, zero cost tools.
4990.68 Going back to this paper,
4991.927 "Catecholamine Predictors of Complicated
4993.62 Grief Treatment Outcomes,"
4995.8 should say that not only did participants
4998.52 with the highest levels of adrenaline
4999.9 have the highest levels
5000.733 of complicated grief
symptoms post-treatment,
5003.39 but the predictive relationship
between these two things,
5007.31 adrenaline and complicated grief,
5008.97 was not seen in depression.
5010.56 And I find that incredibly interesting,
5012.39 because it further separates
depression from grieving
5015.57 and grieving from depression.
5016.97 It's a resounding theme again and again.
5019.14 Grieving is not depression,
5020.36 and depression is not
necessarily grieving.
5022.47 They can coexist, but they
are separable as well,
5025.559 and indeed, reflect separate
brain circuitries entirely.
5030.22 So the conclusion they draw is that
5031.367 "The present study supports the hypothesis
5033.22 that catecholamine levels,"
5034.3 again, epinephrine,
dopamine, norepinephrine
5036.5 are the catecholamines,
5037.537 "are affected by bereavement and in turn,
5039.72 can affect the ability of
those with complicated grief
5042.09 to benefit from psychotherapy."
5043.89 So what does all this mean?
5044.723 What this means is, we
can prepare ourselves
5048.02 to be in a better state to access, yes,
5051.66 access grief when it's appropriate.
5054.06 And indeed, grief is the
appropriate response,
5057.09 when we lose someone,
an animal, or a thing
5059.49 that we are closely attached to,
5061.2 and yet, to be able to move through that
5063.999 at a pace and in a way that
is most adaptive for us.
5069.28 And to just, again, highlight
what adaptive means.
5071.65 It does not mean dissociating
from the attachment
5074.4 to the person, animal, or thing.
5077.14 I just want to pause for a second,
5078.49 and mention why I keep repeating
person, animal, or thing.
5084.18 I'm saying that because,
5086.33 while grieving the loss of a person,
5089.448 or a relationship with a person,
5091.24 doesn't have to be
through death, of course,
5093.05 but death or otherwise
is something that we all
5095.94 can intuitively understand,
5097.32 even if we haven't experienced it.
5099.75 We are capable of
achieving great attachments
5103.08 to animals as well.
5104.9 And while the loss of
a thing, of an object,
5109.17 in no way, shape or form,
5110.52 approximates the loss of
a person or an animal,
5112.94 I would never suggest that it does,
5114.464 it would also be naive and
unfair of me or anyone else
5118.21 to suggest that things can't
hold immense importance to us,
5121.077 and that the loss of them
can feel quite significant,
5124.29 and invoke the grieving process.
5126.65 This isn't always about materialism.
5128.51 Sometimes it's purely about
the sentimental attachment.
5131.41 So for instance, the
loss of a wedding ring
5134.05 or an engagement ring that
was very meaningful to you,
5136.83 or an article of clothing or a painting,
5139.8 or even a small, seemingly
unimportant object
5143.31 to somebody else,
5144.143 but something that held
great meaning to you,
5145.3 maybe a seashell that you collected
5147.46 with somebody on the beach,
5148.75 and then somehow it gets lost.
5151.02 And it's the relationship with that person
5152.831 that's contained within
that object for you,
5156.02 as a representation within
that object that's important.
5159.6 That's the reason why I keep saying,
5161.207 person, animal, or thing.
5163.07 I think it's only fair to
include things in that category,
5166.11 but of course, with the understanding
5167.61 that they don't hold the
absolute same magnitude
5171.26 as the loss of a being.
5173.16 One thing that we ought
to consider for a moment,
5175.17 is whether or not the depth of attachment
5178.37 that you have to somebody
5179.26 predicts how long it will take
5180.81 for you to move through
the loss of that person.
5183.526 We often hear this.
5185.37 Actually, I can remember some years ago,
5187.55 at the end of a relationship,
5189.287 a friend and colleague of mine saying,
5191.877 "You know, for every year
that you were together,
5194.86 it's going to take you one
month to get over that person."
5198.1 And I thought, "Where in the world
5199.97 did those data come from?" [laughs]
5201.807 And this is what I call
anecdata or collective data,
5205.2 where this is like phrases such as,
5207.987 "Absence makes the heart grow fonder."
5210.15 And indeed, sometimes absence
5211.4 can make the heart grow fonder,
5213.08 in the context of two living people
5215.3 or people in a loving relationship,
5217.21 or even in the context of grief and loss.
5219.59 But of course, there's,
5220.707 "Absence makes the heart grow fonder,"
5222.38 and then you also will hear,
5223.537 "Out of sight, out of mind."
5225.27 And if you've been
listening to this episode,
5228.16 clearly, out of sight
does not mean out of mind
5230.8 or out of emotional connection.
5233.62 So these sayings of, "Well,
it takes X number of months
5236.69 for number of years,"
5237.59 or "out of sight, out of mind,"
5238.78 or "absence makes the heart grow fonder,"
5240.118 they really don't hold a lot of meaning,
5242.68 at least not for somebody like me,
5243.89 who likes science because
science is at least geared
5248.48 toward or aims towards establishing things
5250.7 in fact, not opinion,
5252.37 but also because science
allows you to make predictions.
5255.91 It allows you to orient
yourself in a process,
5258.61 and make predictions and understand.
5261.2 So, what are we to think of people
5263.6 who seem very, very attached to somebody?
5267.05 They break up, and they seem
just crushed, devastated.
5270.01 But three weeks later,
5270.86 they're in a new relationship
5272.07 and they seem perfectly fine.
5273.49 Or somebody whose spouse dies,
5277.03 and then suddenly they're
in a new relationship.
5279.35 I think there are rates of
transition, if you will,
5282.27 that suggest some dysfunction,
pathology, et cetera.
5286.49 But here we aren't in a position to judge.
5288.63 We're only in a position
to speculate about this.
5291.36 And I think we can reasonably speculate
5293.99 that it sort of makes sense
5296.31 why someone who has an
intense attachment to somebody
5300.26 might be able to form
5301.543 intense attachments generally, right,
5304.17 that they aren't restricted to one person,
5305.5 whereas other people who have
5306.45 an intense attachment to somebody
5308.53 might find themselves entirely
incapable of moving on,
5311.27 or it would take them a very long time,
5313.21 hence the lines in the Feynman
letter to Arline about,
5317.4 he had met various other young women.
5320.01 They seemed perfectly nice.
5321.01 And yet, they were meaningless to him
5323.097 in the shadow of her memory,
5326.44 or we should say, in the
light of Arline's memory,
5328.64 or the memory of Arline, rather.
5330.5 So these dimensionalities of attachment,
5334.011 they cut in every direction.
5336.45 And I don't think any
well-trained psychologist
5339.42 or neuroscientist would ever say,
5341.137 "Oh, if you are somebody
who becomes very attached,
5343.341 therefore it's very hard to move on."
5345.64 I think that could be true.
5346.57 It could also be that if you're somebody
5347.79 who has a great capacity for attachment,
5349.36 you have a great capacity
for attachment overall.
5352.36 Neuroscience nor psychology
is really in a position
5355.286 to judge, certainly,
5357.12 but it's also not in a position
5358.57 to make those kinds of predictions,
5359.75 at least the field, as
it stands right now,
5362.502 of attachment and grieving,
5365.19 can't really speak to why that's the case.
5367.37 So that's my attempt to depathologize
5370.03 some of what we observe,
5371.49 although I have to confess,
5373.026 from a just sort of everyday stance,
5376.4 that sometimes the rate in which
5377.93 people move out of
attachments and grieving
5380.336 can be somewhat eerie.
5382.16 I'd like to take a moment
and explore this idea
5384.97 that allowing ourselves to really feel
5387.41 the attachment to somebody
5389.01 can accelerate or at least support
5391.16 adaptive transitioning through grief.
5395.176 There's a really wonderful
study that, on the face of it,
5398.99 appears to be a, what
we call negative result.
5401.86 A negative result is when
a hypothesis is posed,
5404.74 and then turns out the
hypothesis is not true.
5407.66 But as is the case with so many
5409.49 interesting scientific findings,
5412.29 often when there's a negative result,
5413.95 there's a more interesting result
5415.28 nested in that negative outcome.
5417.26 And this is the case in a particular paper
5419.62 I'll share with you now.
5420.453 This is a paper published
5421.286 in the journal "Biological Psychology."
5423.36 And again, the title is posed
as a question, which is,
5427.117 "Emotional Disclosure for Whom?
5429.7 A Study of Vagal Tone in Bereavement."
5432.52 What this study explored
5433.7 was whether or not written disclosure
5436.9 of the emotional connection
to somebody that was lost
5439.87 would be effective as a way for people
5442.55 to move through the grieving process.
5446.254 The study also explored
the so-called vagus nerve.
5449.33 The vagus nerve is an
extensive nerve pathway
5451.86 that is bidirectional
between brain and body,
5454.03 so brain to body and body to brain.
5456.53 It generally is associated
with calming effects
5459.536 on our brain and body,
5460.91 although that's certainly
not always the case.
5463.87 The way to think about it in terms of
5465.35 what we're going to talk about now
5467.42 is heart rate and heart rate variability.
5470.48 And in very simplistic terms,
5473.54 if your heart was just allowed to beat
5475.7 at its sort of default rate,
5477.99 that rate would be rather high,
5480.36 because of the activation of
the so-called sympathetic arm
5483.33 of the autonomic nervous system,
5484.51 the alertness component of
the autonomic nervous system.
5489.52 The parasympathetic nervous system,
5491.75 as it's called, involves calming.
5493.76 We sometimes hear
sympathetic is for stress
5496.1 or fight or flight.
5497.45 It's for a lot of other things
as well, I should mention,
5499.3 and it is not for sympathy.
5500.83 Sympa simply means together,
5502.11 and it reflects the activity
of a bunch of neurons
5503.97 being active at the same
time or together, sympa,
5507.27 whereas parasympathetic
is often associated
5509.84 with quote unquote rest
and digest functions,
5512.21 or calming functions,
5513.25 although it is certainly
involved in other things as well.
5515.54 So sympathetic nervous
system drives alertness,
5518.43 panic, stress, et cetera.
5520.81 Parasympathetic nervous system,
5522.07 meaning a distinct set
of neurons drive calming,
5524.95 falling asleep, digestion,
5527.062 sexual arousal for that matter, and so on.
5530.92 So it's sort of like a seesaw
5532.34 of alertness and calm, alertness and calm,
5534.2 sympathetic and
parasympathetic, back and forth.
5536.75 The vagus nerve is generally associated
5539.17 with parasympathetic functions,
5541.12 and has the capacity to
slow down our heart rate,
5544.99 in particular, by exhales,
5547.52 and just simply because of
the movement of the diaphragm
5549.79 and its relationship to the heart
5551.0 and the thoracic cavity.
5552.45 Exhales result in slowing
down of the heart rate.
5557.29 This is what we call an
increased vagal tone.
5561.16 So let me explain for a moment.
5563.13 And actually here's a tool you can use,
5564.4 not just in terms of navigating grief,
5566.24 but in terms of stress
modulation, generally.
5568.72 We have a muscle called the diaphragm.
5570.57 When we inhale, [inhales]
5572.61 whether or not it's through
our mouth or our nose,
5574.58 our diaphragm moves down.
5577.3 As a consequence, there
is more space overall
5579.75 in the thoracic cavity.
5581.06 The heart gets a little bit bigger,
5582.68 believe it or not, volume-wise,
5585.094 blood flows more slowly
through that large volume.
5588.65 And there's a signal conveyed
5590.62 from the nervous system to the
heart to speed the heart up.
5593.46 So inhales literally speed your heart up.
5595.38 And when you exhale,
the diaphragm moves up.
5599.56 And as a consequence,
5600.73 there's less space in the thoracic cavity.
5602.49 Heart gets a little bit smaller.
5604.384 The existing blood volume
in the heart at that time
5606.78 moves more quickly through
that small volume, right?
5608.96 Given amount of blood volume,
5610.18 make the compartment it's
in, the heart, smaller,
5612.73 and the blood moves more
quickly through that volume.
5614.98 And as a consequence, the nervous system
5616.63 sends a signal to the heart,
5618.21 via the vagus and other pathways,
5621.01 to slow the heart down.
5622.38 In other words, exhales
slow the heart down.
5624.55 That process, that relationship
5625.539 between inhales speeding the heart up,
5628.03 and exhales slowing the heart down,
5629.9 is something called
respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
5632.66 Some people are able to engage
respiratory sinus arrhythmia
5636.71 more naturally, more
reflexively than others.
5639.08 You can actually train this
5640.55 by consciously thinking
about slowing your heart rate
5642.86 while you exhale,
5644.07 and consciously thinking about
increasing your heart rate
5646.93 as you inhale.
5647.763 You can literally
strengthen these pathways.
5650.27 Now, respiratory sinus arrhythmia,
5653.17 and the ability to slow your
heart rate with exhales,
5656.67 is one dimension of
what's called vagal tone,
5659.64 or your ability to control
5661.46 your overall level of activation
of alertness and stress,
5665.25 with these vagus nerve pathways.
5667.81 So vagal tone is something
5669.06 that varies from person to person.
5670.46 If you've trained up
or you've thought about
5672.25 your relationship between
breath and heart rate,
5674.15 you can improve vagal tone.
5676.32 Some people have very robust vagal tone
5679.079 without having done any training.
5680.72 Other people have less of it, et cetera.
5684.64 I'll just paraphrase from this paper,
5686.04 and you'll see where this takes us
5687.45 in terms of navigating grief,
because it's quite important.
5690.517 "The vagus nerve provides
5691.65 inhibitory regulatory
influence on the heart,
5693.87 allowing the heart rate
to increase rapidly
5695.95 through vagal withdrawal,"
5696.9 that means kind of coming off the break
5699.12 of the parasympathetic nervous system,
5700.917 "as in response to a stressor
in one's environment."
5703.65 Right, when you're stressed,
5704.92 you rarely take the opportunity,
5706.65 if it's an immediate stress
or threat, to actively exhale,
5709.85 although that would be
a great tool to use.
5711.13 And in fact, we promote that tool
5712.27 in our "Mastering Stress" episode.
5714.837 "Vagal withdrawal usually co-occurs
5716.15 with an increase in sympathetic
activation of the heart."
5718.23 You now know what that is,
5719.677 "or is known as the
fight or flight response.
5721.39 Vagal tone reflects the degree
to which there is tonic,"
5724.83 meaning ongoing, "vagal
influence on the heart."
5728.49 So when you have a high
degree of vagal tone,
5732.04 it means that you are
always activating that break
5736.63 on your stress system, just at default.
5738.82 And some people just
happen to do that more.
5740.25 Other people need to practice
long exhale breathing
5742.66 in order to build up vagal tone,
5745.03 something that's very useful to do,
5746.96 whether you're grieving or not.
5748.87 Now in this study, what they did
5750.25 is they had people,
5752.46 and I should say it was 35 participants,
5755.68 go through a writing exercise
for a period of weeks.
5758.45 They actually wrote about
three times per week.
5760.87 Then there was a follow
up at some period of time,
5762.93 and then again, about a month later.
5764.43 And there were two different groups.
5766.8 One group was in the so-called
written disclosure group.
5769.85 What they did is they, on day one,
5772.3 they would write about what
happened when a loved one died.
5776.18 And indeed they used people
who had experienced real loss.
5779.49 And so they were asked to talk about
5781.69 and write about their deepest emotions
5784.23 and thoughts about it,
memories of their loved one,
5786.87 very intense stuff, if you think about it,
5788.66 if they're in the immediate
period of having lost someone.
5791.6 Then they actually were
asked to write a letter
5793.78 to the person that they lost.
5795.18 So again, a very intense
exercise to go through,
5799.05 if you did indeed lose
somebody as these subjects had.
5802.17 And then of course there was the testing,
5803.62 some period of time later,
5805.97 and I'll tell you what that period,
5807.38 what that testing involved.
5809.93 The other group was a
so-called control group,
5811.68 where they were simply told to write
5813.22 about how they use their time.
5814.51 So an emotionally kind of
empty writing exercise,
5816.95 if you will.
5817.783 They described what they did
today after they woke up,
5819.79 et cetera, no heavy
emotional content, and so on.
5823.43 Now, as I mentioned earlier,
5825.89 the immediate results of this
study were a negative result,
5829.68 meaning no effect.
5831.7 The disclosure that, we should say,
5833.24 the emotionally intense writing group
5835.01 and the control group did
not differ at baseline
5836.99 on any symptom measures
5838.26 or psychological variables, they tell us,
5840.3 and at least at face value,
somewhat disappointingly,
5844.75 there really wasn't any kind
of difference in outcome
5848.41 between the group that wrote about
5850.147 the very emotionally intense stuff
5851.93 versus non-emotionally intense.
5853.67 Now, what I didn't tell you thus far
5855.83 is why they had them do
this exercise at all.
5858.5 They had them do this exercise
5859.75 because many of the effective practices
5861.76 for moving through grief
involve, as I mentioned earlier,
5864.94 getting close to and actually
deliberately experiencing
5869.86 the attachment that one has
to that person that was lost,
5872.68 not distracting one's self,
5874.49 not getting into this
counterfactual thinking,
5876.9 the what if, what if, what if,
5878.17 but rather thinking about,
5879.93 or in this case, writing
about the real attachment.
5882.53 And so the initial idea was,
5884.82 if people write about this attachment,
5886.48 that they're going to
experience this attachment,
5887.817 and that will serve them
in some or many ways,
5891.05 in terms of moving through grief.
5892.98 And that wasn't what they found.
5894.09 They found no difference
between the two groups,
5895.93 until they explored who
had higher vagal tone,
5900.88 who had a greater degree
5903.16 of so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
5905.52 In other words, who was able
to modulate their state,
5909.24 using their breathing and their body.
5911.21 And what they discovered was
that a subset of individuals
5914.83 who had a high degree of vagal tone
5917.46 seemed to get more benefit from
this writing-type exercise.
5921.62 Now, this is one study,
5922.96 and I would consider it fairly
preliminary with 35 subjects.
5926.93 Although, you know,
it's a study unto itself
5928.98 and I think a quite nice one,
5931.28 and it really set the stage
5932.33 for a number of other
studies that followed,
5934.17 from this group and other groups,
5935.82 that really point to the
fact that yes, indeed,
5938.64 accessing these states of emotionality
5941.087 by writing or thinking about somebody
5943.14 is quite powerful in terms
of engaging the bodily states
5947.46 and the mind states associated
with the attachment.
5949.347 And that is very beneficial
for moving through grief.
5953.02 That is very beneficial
for sensing the attachment.
5955.683 And now it makes perfect
sense as to why some people
5959.41 would benefit from that sort
of practice more than others,
5961.96 because some people are able to access
5963.802 more real somatic feelings of attachment
5967.73 by writing about the attachment,
5969.13 or by thinking about it, than others.
5971.09 So this brings us back
to an earlier discussion
5973.26 we were having, where
we were talking about
5975.266 how some people seem to move
through things very quickly,
5977.93 or don't seem to be grieving constantly,
5980.09 and a spouse or a family member
of that person might think,
5983.187 "Gosh, why aren't you upset?
5984.63 How is it that you can be
functional and I'm not,"
5986.87 or, "how is it that
you can be functional?"
5988.12 There can even be fractures
in families and relationships
5991.5 on the basis of differences in
rates of grieving and so on.
5994.97 Well, some of this, again,
5996.5 probably relates to psychology
5997.79 and the different attachments
5998.74 that people had to the person or animal
6000.4 or thing that was lost,
6001.36 but it no doubt also has to do
6004.2 with how much of a mind/body connection,
6006.34 how much vagal tone exists in the person,
6009.504 when they suddenly found
themselves in the grief episode.
6013.51 So this actually offers
multiple opportunities.
6015.78 If you're somebody, for instance,
6017.37 who is grieving so intensely and so often
6020.9 that you're finding it immensely difficult
6022.7 to move through grief
at a reasonable rate,
6025.26 and you might even say, or find yourself
6027.28 diagnosed with prolonged grief disorder
6029.17 or with complicated grief syndrome
6030.65 in a way that's really impairing
6033.12 your adaptive functioning in life,
6035.82 well then, it's not clear to me,
6038.21 at least by my read of the data,
6039.6 that you would want to
engage in a lot of practices
6043.03 to increase the mind/body relationship
6045.08 and feeling so much of this attachment,
6046.9 because you're already feeling
an immense amount of it.
6048.95 Whereas other people who
are feeling challenged
6052.74 in accessing the feelings of attachment,
6055.7 and perhaps not functioning well
6057.81 as a consequence of that,
6059.33 might find that practicing breathing
6062.11 in order to encourage
respiratory sinus arrhythmia,
6065.35 again, focusing on slowing
your heart rate consciously
6068.32 while you exhale,
6069.24 and concentrating on
increasing your heart rate
6071.447 as you inhale,
6072.62 even just as a brief practice
6073.9 of even just one to three
minutes or one to five minutes,
6076.77 every once in a while or per day,
6078.58 that could be immensely beneficial
6079.96 in building this mind/body relationship.
6081.56 Because again, what this
paper really points to
6083.67 and set off a number of other
investigations related to,
6086.94 is that for those that can really feel
6089.91 the relationship between
breathing heart rate,
6091.828 what we call vagal tone,
6094.02 well, those people are going
to be in a better position
6097.31 to move through grief,
6098.16 not because they are disengaging
6100.46 from the feelings of attachment,
6102.0 but because they are better able
6103.47 to access those feelings of attachment.
6105.78 So what this relates to of
course is that tripartite map,
6109.53 that three-part map that
we talked about earlier,
6112.48 that representation of
space, where things are,
6115.71 where the person is, where
their belongings are,
6117.5 where their car is,
where their bicycle is,
6119.108 time, when you were expecting to see them
6122.53 on a regular basis,
6123.363 when they would call,
6125.2 when they would come home
from work, et cetera,
6127.52 and that third node,
6129.1 or that third dimension of attachment,
6130.68 which is literally
attachment and closeness.
6133.62 Well, what we're talking about here
6135.29 is anchoring to that attachment
6137.09 and really feeling into that,
6138.43 but then disengaging from
the space and time map
6142.316 that we call episodic memory,
6144.46 that menu of prior experiences,
6146.61 that keeps us in many ways,
6148.29 maladaptively in an expectation
6150.97 of what never can be again.
6152.91 Now I'd like to take a moment and consider
6154.28 some of the tools that you can access
6156.21 that support healthy
transitioning through grief.
6159.71 And these are tools distinct
from that neural map,
6162.15 that space, time and
closeness attachment map
6164.41 that we were talking about before.
6166.13 Rather, it's important to remind ourselves
6168.43 that everything exists
6170.79 in a context of our baseline physiology.
6174.15 And I'm certainly not
going to be the first
6176.18 or the last to tell you
that everything in life,
6179.31 learning, relationships with
people that are still around,
6183.93 our health in every way,
immune system, et cetera,
6186.01 function far better when
we're sleeping really well,
6188.89 and when we are generally
awake during the daytime
6192.17 and asleep at night.
6193.52 I realize there are
shift workers out there,
6195.42 people who are traveling
and are jet-lagged.
6197.69 First of all, thank you, shift workers.
6199.63 We rely on you.
6200.64 We have an episode all about
jet lag and shift work,
6203.04 for you and for trying to maintain
6205.04 the best possible mental
and physical health
6207.07 in the face of ongoing
shift work and jet lag.
6209.42 You can find that episode
6210.48 on our website, hubermanlab.com.
6212.28 Lots of behavioral tools,
some other tools as well.
6216.64 Nonetheless, human beings are diurnal.
6219.48 We were really designed to
be awake mostly in the day
6222.64 and asleep at night.
6223.97 There are rare exceptions to this
6225.12 where people like to stay
up late and sleep in late.
6226.84 But we are a diurnal species,
6229.3 by way of our genetic wiring
6231.305 and our neural circuit wiring.
6234.56 There's a particular
feature to our diurnal,
6237.3 and diurnal, meaning the
opposite of nocturnal,
6239.56 our diurnal pattern of the release
6242.75 of a hormone called cortisol.
6244.85 Cortisol is a stress hormone,
it's sometimes called,
6247.67 but cortisol has a lot of other effects,
6249.94 many of which are positive.
6250.89 Cortisol for instance,
protects us against infection.
6254.11 It can help us in terms of
waking up in the morning.
6257.13 In fact, the pulse as it's called
6259.5 or the spike in cortisol early in the day
6261.89 is part of the reason we wake up.
6263.25 It's linked to our increase
in temperature rhythms,
6266.22 and can further increase our temperature,
6268.97 which leads to waking, and so on.
6271.56 The typical pattern of cortisol
in a healthy individual,
6274.37 and we really can say physically
6276.4 and emotionally healthy individual,
6278.49 is that cortisol is going to be
6280.5 somewhat high right around waking,
6282.77 and then is going to be
highest as it ever will be
6286.1 in the 24-hour period, about
45 minutes post waking,
6289.62 not exactly 45 minutes,
but about 45 minutes.
6292.76 And then it will drop gradually,
6295.45 such that by about 4:00
p.m. in the afternoon,
6298.21 which is actually when body temperature
6299.805 tends to start to drop as well,
6302.35 cortisol tends to be very low,
6304.06 and then remains low in
a healthy individual,
6307.16 such that at 9:00 p.m., it's very low.
6309.72 And throughout the night
as we sleep, it's very low.
6312.02 In fact, spikes or pulses
in 9:00 p.m. cortisol
6316.22 are a fairly reliable biomarker readout
6320.37 of certain forms of depression
and chronic anxiety.
6323.1 This relates to the beautiful
work of my colleagues
6325.22 at Stanford and Stanford
School of Medicine,
6326.9 Dr. David Spiegel, who's
been on this podcast,
6328.95 and Dr. Robert Sapolsky, who
has also been on this podcast.
6334.94 There's a very interesting paper
6336.66 exploring the relationship
6338.04 between cortisol rhythms
and grieving, in particular,
6342.27 complicated versus
non-complicated grieving.
6344.49 Again, complicated grieving
being the form of grieving
6346.38 that reflects a immense challenge
6349.46 of people moving through
the grieving process,
6351.02 such that it really needs
to be dealt with, right?
6354.49 Again, grieving is healthy,
but complicated grieving
6356.98 is a prolonged grieving,
6358.16 and has other dimensions as well,
6359.64 hence the name complicated.
6360.88 The title of this paper is,
6362.757 "Diurnal Cortisol in Complicated
and Non-Complicated Grief,
6366.55 Slope Differences Across the Day."
6369.09 And the figure to orient to in this paper,
6371.81 if you do decide to check it out,
6373.23 and we'll put a link to it,
6375.064 is Figure One, which beautifully shows,
6378.78 or I should say very clearly shows,
6381.69 that in individuals that are
experiencing complicated grief,
6386.13 there's the same general contour
6388.07 of high cortisol upon waking,
6390.06 even higher about 45 minutes after waking,
6392.6 and then a reduction in
cortisol by 4:00 p.m.,
6395.3 and even further reduction by 9:00 p.m.,
6397.28 so just as it were in
a typical individual,
6399.77 or somebody who is in
non-complicated grieving.
6402.63 However, when you compare
the cortisol levels
6405.007 between people experiencing
complicated grieving
6408.03 versus non-complicated grieving,
6409.73 what you find is the 4:00 p.m.
6411.615 and 9:00 p.m. cortisol levels
6414.01 are significantly higher than they are
6416.425 in the non-complicated grieving group.
6419.57 This raises a very interesting idea,
6422.02 and relates very closely
6423.51 to what we were talking
about with vagal tone.
6426.12 You could imagine a situation
6427.67 in which people who are
experiencing complicated grief
6431.39 have higher levels of afternoon
and nighttime cortisol,
6434.88 because they are in complicated grief,
6437.28 but you could also imagine the opposite,
6439.29 that they're experiencing
complicated grief
6441.73 because of the fact that
they have elevated cortisol.
6444.97 Now, it's very likely
that it's bidirectional,
6447.82 that the answer isn't one
or the other, but both,
6451.19 that complicated grief
changes patterns of cortisol,
6454.58 and that patterns of cortisol
change the likelihood
6457.26 that one has complicated grief.
6459.87 That's the most logical
interpretation of data like these.
6463.09 However, when taken along
with the data on vagal tone,
6467.33 that people who have a
higher level of vagal tone
6470.64 are better able to navigate
situations of the sort
6474.85 that we're talking about,
6476.11 and that some people perhaps
have oxytocin receptors
6480.01 or patterns of catecholamines
or epinephrine,
6482.75 that position them to be more likely
6484.39 to grieve in a particular way,
6486.03 we arrive at a scenario where
it makes very good sense
6489.877 to think about modulating,
6492.23 that is controlling the
foundation of your life,
6495.21 in a way that establishes
cortisol rhythms,
6498.08 and sleep patterns,
6499.19 and patterns of autonomic
arousal and catecholamine release
6502.75 that position you to
navigate the grief process
6505.834 in the best possible way.
6507.712 If that was a complicated
mouthful to digest,
6510.41 let me restate it in a simpler way.
6512.524 If you are somebody who
is heading into grief
6515.598 or is challenged with grief,
6517.35 complicated grief, or otherwise,
6519.0 prolonged grief or otherwise,
6521.535 getting adequate sleep at night
6523.424 and establishing as normal a
pattern of cortisol as possible
6529.67 is going to be very important.
6531.26 And there's a very simple,
straightforward way to do this.
6533.62 And I apologize to the listeners
of this podcast in advance,
6536.17 if I sound like a repeating record,
6537.51 but the most powerful way to do this
6539.94 is to view sunlight, very close to waking.
6543.97 It does not have to be right at sunrise,
6545.63 but when you get up in the morning,
6547.77 if the sun isn't out,
6549.5 please turn on as many bright lights
6551.08 as possible in your environment.
6555.23 And then once the sun is out,
6556.48 try and get some bright
sunlight in your eyes.
6558.85 Never look at any light so bright
6561.25 that it's painful to look
at, sunlight or otherwise.
6563.99 If you live in an area of the world
6565.36 where there isn't a lot of sunlight,
6567.46 please keep in mind that sunlight
coming through cloud cover
6569.66 is going to still be a
very effective mechanism
6571.789 for establishing this cortisol rhythm.
6573.93 Why do I say this thing about sunlight
6575.25 over and over and over again?
6576.73 Well, having an early day cortisol peak
6579.69 and a very low cortisol
level late in the day,
6583.81 4:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.,
is immensely beneficial.
6587.33 It's, reflects a properly regulated
6589.81 autonomic nervous system.
6590.98 It means being alert during the day.
6592.29 And your ability to sleep at
night is tightly correlated
6595.32 to this viewing of
sunlight in the morning.
6597.69 If you have additional
questions about this
6599.68 or these protocols,
6600.539 please see our "Mastering
Sleep" episode also
6603.94 at hubermanlab.com.
6604.98 But in brief, you don't
want to wear sunglasses
6607.86 when you do this.
6608.693 You do not want to do this
6610.07 through a window or a windshield.
6611.77 It is 50 times less effective at least,
6613.76 because of filtering of
the proper wavelengths.
6615.75 It is fine to wear eyeglasses,
6618.13 meaning corrective lenses or contacts,
6619.79 even if they have UV protection.
6621.45 Again, sunlight is best
10 minutes to 30 minutes,
6624.25 depending on how bright it is outside,
6625.61 and so on and so forth.
6627.3 I keep coming back to this protocol,
6628.75 because first of all, it is a zero cost,
6631.46 but very effective way to regulate things
6635.49 like cortisol rhythms, melatonin rhythms,
6637.42 wakefulness during the day,
6639.0 ease of falling asleep
at night, and so on,
6641.28 and second of all, because
I want to emphasize
6644.01 this idea of modulation.
6646.0 There are processes in our brain and body
6648.01 which directly mediate
some psychological effect
6650.969 or physiological effect, right?
6653.03 Dopamine is directly
involved in motivation.
6655.95 If you're somebody who
struggles with motivation,
6658.52 your dopamine system is likely
6659.88 to be dysregulated in some way.
6661.33 And there are behavioral tools
6662.163 and other tools to adjust that.
6663.89 We had an episode on
dopamine motivation and drive
6666.23 that talks extensively about those tools.
6668.639 However, the process of
grief can't be distilled
6672.75 down to one molecule, one circuit,
6675.14 such that we can say, "Oh,
you know, take this supplement
6677.46 or eat this diet and/or
exercise in the following way,
6680.83 and you'll recover from
grief more quickly."
6683.53 It's simply not the case.
6684.9 It is the case, however,
6685.98 that proper sleep at
night sets the foundation
6689.24 for the proper emotional tone,
6692.24 to be able to navigate
physical, psychological,
6695.68 and other types of challenges,
6696.93 and not incidentally, sleep at night,
6700.78 I should say, sufficient duration
6702.17 and quality of sleep at night
6703.85 is the way in which you
engage neuroplasticity,
6706.16 the reordering of neural connections,
6708.0 and everything we've
been talking about today
6710.47 about reordering of the maps in your mind.
6712.72 This tripartite, three-part map
6714.15 of space, time, and closeness
involves neuroplasticity,
6717.59 the reconfiguring of
connections between neurons,
6720.5 strengthening certain pathways,
6722.03 and not strengthening others,
6723.56 actively trying to disengage
from the what if, right,
6727.12 this counterintuitive thinking,
6728.3 actively trying to disengage
from the expectations
6731.23 that someone will be there,
6732.64 although when you find
yourself doing that,
6734.21 understanding why it's so
reflexive and normal to do that,
6738.41 actively trying to lean
into the real attachment
6740.87 to somebody, animal, or thing,
6744.27 and yet at the same time,
not deluding yourself
6748.49 and undermining the whole
process of grieving,
6750.92 by trying to imagine that they are in fact
6752.75 still, truly there, right?
6754.68 It's a very narrow
knife edge of a process,
6758.25 which is why it's so challenging.
6760.41 Regulating your cortisol
rhythm through viewing sunlight
6763.11 early in the day, and I should also say,
6765.4 avoiding bright lights
from artificial sources
6767.437 in the evening, generally
10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m,
6771.05 but certainly in the evening,
6773.53 trying to dim lights in
your immediate environment,
6776.01 trying to avoid bright screens,
6777.64 bright artificial lights
as much as possible,
6779.92 and accessing that deep sleep,
6781.52 that's modulating, it's setting
an overall autonomic state
6785.58 or an overall autonomic landscape,
6788.35 would be the better way to describe it,
6790.2 that's going to allow you to sleep
6791.57 and get neuroplasticity,
6792.59 sleep and be in the best emotional state
6794.34 to navigate the grieving process.
6795.78 Because it's only fair to say
6798.21 that the grieving process as
we're describing it is hard,
6801.74 and not just because
it's emotionally hard.
6803.49 It's cognitively hard.
6804.97 You just think about what's required
6806.42 to move through grief
properly, if you will.
6808.96 It's thinking about,
6811.17 and actually physically
experiencing the depth,
6815.04 the full depth of the
attachment to the person,
6817.58 while at the same time trying to uncouple
6819.47 from that rich menu, that
catalog of episodic memories
6823.464 that can date back many, many years
6825.68 and have so much richness.
6826.83 So many predictions form on the basis
6829.93 of those episodic memories,
6831.24 and actively trying to distance ourselves
6833.44 from those memories,
6834.41 by being very anchored in
the fact that we are present,
6836.78 we are the person alone in that room,
6838.71 or in some cases with a
bereavement group in that room,
6842.27 or with other people that
are mourning the loss
6844.43 of that individual, animal, or thing,
6846.097 and that knife edge of feeling
the intense attachment,
6852.4 while also disengaging from all the things
6854.92 that led to that attachment.
6856.693 Well, it's understandable
6858.49 why that would be so challenging,
6860.09 and it should also be understandable
6862.091 why positioning yourself
to be able to do that
6864.71 in the best possible way
requires proper sleep.
6868.02 So what are the tools that
we can think about using,
6870.63 in terms of healthy, adaptive
moving through grief,
6873.45 trying to avoid complicated grief
6875.27 and prolonged grief disorders?
6878.45 I realize that word disorder
implies all sorts of things,
6881.05 but again, those are just
naming categorizations
6883.376 that people come up with,
6885.019 that I think fairly reflect the fact
6887.87 that some people have more challenge
6889.71 moving through grieving than others.
6891.83 And for some people it
can be very extended.
6894.13 I think the common misunderstanding
6896.64 is that proper grieving involves
6899.7 moving through something quickly.
6901.1 We're certainly not saying that.
6903.4 However, it is very clear that
some people can get stuck,
6907.14 and that process of getting stuck,
6909.28 you should now understand,
6910.73 has a lot to do with maintaining
6913.56 or reactivating those episodic memories,
6915.71 those expectations of
where somebody will be
6918.33 in space and time.
6920.77 So what can we say about the
tools for moving through grief?
6923.46 Clearly it's of value to
dedicate some period of time,
6927.32 perhaps every day,
perhaps every other day,
6929.77 depending on your capacity and schedule.
6933.28 These could be periods
of time ranging anywhere
6934.94 from five to 45 minutes, maybe longer.
6938.61 These blocks of time would
be appropriately described
6942.27 as rational grieving, right?
6944.98 Rational grieving is a clear acceptance
6947.82 of the new reality that
the person, animal,
6950.42 or thing no longer exists
6951.8 in the same space/time dimensionality
6953.99 that we knew them before,
6955.48 and yet holding on to an anchoring
6957.83 to the attachment that we had.
6960.12 This is again, not an unhealthy
anchoring to the attachment.
6963.87 This is really anchoring to the depth
6965.617 and the intensity of the
attachment that existed,
6968.5 as a way to, for lack of
a better way to put it,
6972.66 push off from those episodic memories,
6975.198 to distance ourselves from them.
6976.87 Because those episodic
memories are the ones
6979.47 that lead us to look for the
person in our current reality.
6982.85 And assuming this is a
real and complete loss,
6985.593 those sorts of expectations
are maladaptive.
6988.84 They do not serve us well.
6991.35 The second aspect of this is to understand
6993.302 that the node of the map,
6996.16 the component of the neural
map that you're anchoring to,
7000.16 is a very real component of you.
7001.7 These are literally cells
7002.76 that represent the depth of attachment.
7005.11 They are linked up with your
emotional centers in the brain,
7007.46 and indeed they're
linked up with your body.
7009.54 I think one of the things
that comes up so often
7011.594 when people are grieving is
why does it hurt so much?
7014.96 Well, that hurt is that yearning.
7017.6 It's that anticipation of action
7019.41 that you want to engage in,
7021.21 but some part of you at least
knows that it leads nowhere.
7024.83 It's that reaching for that glass of water
7026.63 in a kind of desert of thirst,
7028.842 and you know you can't have it.
7031.01 That's why it hurts so badly,
7032.13 because the systems of your brain and body
7034.37 are in a place of
anticipation of readiness.
7037.68 And given the activation of
these brain reward systems
7041.49 like the nucleus accumbens,
7042.97 given your now understanding of oxytocin,
7045.39 being more enriched in
the nucleus accumbens
7048.964 of some individuals and
as opposed to others,
7053.32 it should make perfect sense
7054.32 as to why it's so painful in your body.
7057.46 We talked a moment ago about
the importance of accessing
7060.11 quality sleep on a regular basis,
7062.34 gave you at least one tool to do that.
7063.96 There are again, a rich
array of tools to do that
7066.79 in the "Mastering Sleep" episode.
7068.45 And again, highlighting
the importance of sleep
7070.505 for not just emotion regulation
and autonomic control,
7074.83 which is so vital, but
also for making sure
7076.84 that neuroplasticity takes place.
7078.41 Because again, neuroplasticity
is a two-part process.
7080.68 There's the triggering of the plasticity,
7082.19 which in the case of the things
7084.18 we're talking about today,
7085.013 will be naturally
activated by the practice
7088.04 of a dedicated focusing on the attachment,
7090.36 feeling the attachment to the person,
7091.69 maybe even writing about the
attachment to the person,
7094.2 as was described in that previous study,
7096.41 but also just the
plasticity is triggered by
7100.08 the mere loss of that person,
7101.75 the intensity of that experience.
7103.1 But neuroplasticity, the
literal rewiring of connections,
7106.27 occurs during deep sleep
7108.47 and in what I call
non-sleep deep rest or NSDR.
7111.057 And you can find NSDR scripts,
7112.85 these are short behavioral protocols
7114.78 that you do for 10 to 30 minutes
7116.7 at some point throughout the day,
7117.74 maybe even multiple
times through your day,
7118.97 that have been shown to
accelerate neuroplasticity.
7123.19 So having a such a practice
can be very useful,
7125.65 and understand that it
involves some cognitive work.
7128.87 We have to hold onto the attachment,
7130.48 and imagine and feel as much
as we can, the attachment,
7133.57 while also being extremely
rationally grounded,
7137.41 and trying to not try
to hold onto the past,
7141.49 trying to not anticipate the
person walking in the room.
7144.45 This is very hard because
7146.4 when we think about the attachment,
7147.63 the attachment tends to drag with it
7150.31 those episodic memories,
7151.8 that rich catalog of experiences.
7153.72 The expectation that they
will walk in the room
7155.63 is perfectly natural.
7157.3 The hard cognitive work
7158.812 is to experience the deep,
emotional attachment,
7163.17 while at the same time severing from
7165.57 or distancing ourselves
from these expectations
7168.86 that they'll suddenly
show up in our reality,
7170.7 when in fact, they won't.
7173.58 And we talked about preparing
ourselves for grief, right?
7176.84 If we have a loved one that's dying,
7179.29 or we anticipate that at some point
7181.36 we are going to have a loss of some sort,
7183.71 could be death,
7184.543 could be a loss of another type,
7186.09 breakup, et cetera,
7187.56 that we can prepare ourselves
to grieve more adaptively
7191.46 by regulating the level of catecholamines,
7194.14 in particular epinephrine,
7195.65 that was well-described in the study
7197.54 that I referred to earlier,
7198.93 and tools such as the one found
7201.01 in our "Mastering Stress" episode,
7202.57 and tools of the sort that
we talked about today,
7205.29 increasing that vagal tone
7207.31 by actively building up the relationship
7210.08 between exhales and slowing
down of the heart rate,
7213.06 so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
7215.18 Those things can be very useful tools.
7216.73 So we can actually
encourage our nervous system
7220.5 and build our nervous system
7221.77 and build our mind to prepare for grief
7223.81 when it inevitably will come.
7226.37 Again, this is not about
buffering ourselves
7228.49 from the realities of life.
7229.69 This is not about disengaging from grief
7233.39 as a real and important process.
7235.41 And indeed, it is a real and
important process to engage in.
7238.68 Those that enter denial,
7240.91 or try and distract
themselves with substances
7243.82 or thinking or distracting of behavior,
7247.45 substances or otherwise,
7249.2 won't move through grief
as well, as adaptively,
7251.83 as those who embrace a process of the sort
7254.223 that I'm describing here.
7255.49 And of course, I want to restate again,
7258.121 that even though grief and depression
7261.24 are now known to be
fundamentally different,
7264.26 even though people move through
7265.54 the different stages of grief
7266.7 at different rates and sometimes
skip stages, et cetera,
7269.99 it is often important to access
7271.168 a trained professional psychologist,
7273.24 or psychiatrist, or both,
7275.39 or bereavement group,
7276.41 or all of the above,
7279.11 in order to get the proper
support for grieving.
7281.63 So this is a podcast about
science and science-based tools,
7286.66 but I absolutely want to emphasize
7289.58 that there are terrific
resources out there
7291.97 that you can access.
7293.51 I don't say this in any kind of glib
7295.21 or kind of pass the buck kind of way.
7297.56 There are wonderful trained therapists,
7300.93 bereavement groups,
psychiatrists that are expert
7305.73 in navigating these sorts of things.
7307.73 I like to think that the tools
7309.08 that we've talked about today
7310.69 would be not only compatible,
7312.59 but would be complementary
7314.01 to the sorts of approaches that they take.
7316.27 And as we think about
this process of grief,
7319.51 as we all should at
some point in our lives,
7322.61 because we all indeed
will experience grief
7324.56 in one form or another,
7326.9 I would hope that the information
that we discussed today
7330.16 would not only give you some tools,
7333.12 but hopefully give you
a better understanding
7335.0 of not just the people that you've lost
7337.53 or that you stand to lose,
7338.57 not just the animals that
you've lost and stand to lose,
7341.8 but also give you a sense of why it is
7344.04 that the people who are still in your life
7346.127 and that you're attached to,
7347.2 the animals that are still in your life,
7348.61 that you're attached to,
7350.06 have such profound meaning for you.
7351.88 And I would encourage you
to not lean away from,
7355.15 but rather to lean into the building
7357.27 of those episodic memories,
7359.26 to build up a richer and
richer set of experiences
7362.75 and emotional attachments.
7364.6 Because while the process of grieving
7366.303 is in direct relation to how close
7368.93 we are attached to people,
7370.22 there are ways to move through it.
7371.9 And of course it is the
depth of our attachments,
7374.53 and the number and the depth of meaning
7376.51 of experiences that we share
with others and with animals
7379.59 that makes life so rich and worth living.
7382.32 So I just want to take a
moment and say thank you
7384.2 for being willing to explore
this rather complicated,
7387.94 and sometimes extremely challenging thing
7390.57 that we call grief,
7391.74 from the perspective or through the lens
7393.59 of neuroscience and psychology.
7395.74 I certainly learned a lot in
exploring this literature.
7398.26 I also really look
forward to hosting people
7401.01 like Dr. O'Connor on the podcast,
7403.97 and others on the podcast
7405.143 who've done such beautiful
work in this area.
7407.98 I've put out the request,
7408.92 and hopefully they'll join us soon
7410.13 to further elaborate and teach us
7412.45 about this fundamental
component of our lives.

7445.63 That's the best way to support us.
7447.54 Not during today's episode,
7448.77 but on many previous episodes
7450.14 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
7451.69 we've discussed supplements.
7453.15 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
7454.99 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them,
7457.34 for things like easing and accelerating
7459.47 the transition time into sleep,
7461.83 and getting better, deeper sleep,
7464.0 as well as things such
as focus, et cetera.
7467.07 We've partnered with
Momentous Supplements,
7469.25 because Momentous
Supplements, first of all,
7470.86 are of extremely high quality.
7472.96 That's obviously important.
7474.42 Also, they ship internationally.
7476.06 We had heard from many of you
7477.16 that you were having trouble
7478.29 accessing some of the supplements
7479.456 that were described on
the Huberman Lab Podcast,
7482.04 because you did not live in the U.S.
7483.31 Momentous ships both
within the U.S. and abroad.
7486.62 And many of you have also requested
7488.219 that there be a single site
7490.25 where you could access
all of the supplements
7492.66 that we've talked about on
the Huberman Lab Podcast.
7495.58 Right now at livemomentous.com/huberman,
7499.3 you can find a subset of the supplements
7501.39 that have been described on this podcast.
7503.28 Again, all of the very highest quality.
7505.72 Each, single-ingredient supplements.
7507.48 That turns out to be very important
7508.57 if you're trying to develop
7509.485 the proper array of supplements for you.
7511.51 It's not helpful to have supplements
7513.37 that include many ingredients,
7514.58 so we encouraged Momentous
7516.32 to have single-ingredient supplements
7518.053 with dosages that allow you to build up
7520.53 from the minimal
effective dose, and so on.
7523.85 And the catalog of supplements
7525.1 they are going to add to that location,
7526.761 livemomentous.com/huberman,
7528.89 is going to expand in the
weeks and months to come.
7531.2 And we expect that in a
fairly short amount of time,
7534.57 all of the supplements
that we've described
7536.08 on the Huberman Lab Podcast will be there.
7538.01 If you're not already
following @hubermanlab
7539.77 on Instagram and Twitter,
7541.56 I post science and science-related tools
7543.58 @hubermanlab on Instagram,
also @hubermanlab on Twitter.
7547.663 Oftentimes that material
will overlap somewhat
7550.13 with the content covered on this podcast,
7552.16 but more often than not,
7553.96 what I'm covering on Instagram and Twitter
7555.41 is distinct from the information I cover
7557.43 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
7559.19 We also have a newsletter that
has summaries of podcasts,
7562.69 and points to specific protocols and links
7565.18 that could be useful to you.
7566.76 That is the Neural Network Newsletter,
7569.09 and you can find it at hubermanlab.com.
7571.36 Go to the menu, go to Newsletter.
7572.8 You can sign up simply
by giving us your email.
7574.73 We do not share your
email with anybody else.
7576.78 Our privacy policy is there,
and is made very clear.
7579.65 You can also see some
newsletters of months past,
7582.205 so you can assess whether or not
7583.9 you really do want to sign up,
7585.37 although I like to think that you will.
7586.84 Again, zero cost, total
privacy of your email account,
7589.914 and many people find those Summaries
7592.65 and Takeaway Tools to be very useful
7594.17 in navigating these admittedly
long podcast episodes.
7598.52 And last, but certainly not least,
7600.79 thank you for your interest in science.
